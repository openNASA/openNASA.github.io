						<p><em>Noting today some new and interesting <span class="caps">NASA</span>-related social media efforts
across the&nbsp;web:</em></p>
<p><strong>Meteor Counter application on&nbsp;iTunes</strong>  </p>
<p><a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/13dec_meteorcounter/">http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/13dec_meteorcounter/</a></p>
<p>You can help <span class="caps">NASA</span> astronomers! The Meteor Counter harnesses the power of
citizen scientists to document meteor observations – right from their
iPhone. Using an intuitive interface to document time, magnitude, and
location, all kinds of observers can contribute easily to science
efforts as <span class="caps">NASA</span> works to map meteoroids all around Earth’s&nbsp;orbit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NASA</span> Goddard Space Flight Center on Instagram</strong><br />
<a href="http://web.stagram.com/n/nasagoddard/">http://web.stagram.com/n/nasagoddard/</a></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> Goddard Space Flight Center has built a following on a less
traditional social media platform: Instagram! The Goddard team is using
one of <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s most breathtaking resources – our imagery – to connect
directly with the public. Visually interesting images from inside their
Center to far across the universe get people engaged in <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NASA</span> Sounds: Third Rock Radio and Ringtones</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.rfcmedia.com/thirdrockradio/">http://www.rfcmedia.com/thirdrockradio/</a><br />
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/">http://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/</a></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> released a collection of <span class="caps">NASA</span> sounds from historic spaceflights and
current missions in both <span class="caps">MP3</span> and <span class="caps">M4R</span> (iPhone) sound files to download.
You can hear the roar of a space shuttle launch or Neil Armstrong’s “One
small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind” every time you get a
phone call. On Third Rock Radio, <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s mission of discovery and
exploration is being showcased in a custom-produced Internet music radio
station that is crafted specifically to speak the language of tech-savvy
young&nbsp;adults.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NEEMO</span> 15 on Zooniverse</strong><br />
<a href="http://neemo.zooniverse.org/">http://neemo.zooniverse.org/</a></p>
<p>We have seen how crowd-sourcing open space data can discover new
galaxies, planets, and even make a detailed map of the Moon. In
partnership with Zooniverse Labs and the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/NEEMO15/index.html"><span class="caps">NEEMO</span>-15</a> underwater analog
mission, <span class="caps">NASA</span> is looking at technologies that will let the power of our
interconnectedness drive discovery. Using a new platform which takes a
square kilometer of ocean-bottom imagery and parses it out into an
easily navigable, compelling user interface, <span class="caps">NASA</span> invites the public to
help find scientifically relevant items, in order to allow us to outline
them for a broad representation of the reef. Traverse planning
scientists use this aggegated data to target, or confirm the interest
items for further&nbsp;study.</p>
<p><strong>Space Race Blastoff on Facebook</strong><br />
<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/spacerace">http://apps.facebook.com/spacerace</a></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s first multi-player Facebook game tests players&#8217; knowledge of
space history, technology, science and pop culture. Players who
correctly answer questions earn virtual badges depicting <span class="caps">NASA</span>
astronauts, spacecraft and celestial objects. Players also earn points
they can use to obtain additional badges to complete sets and earn
premium badges. Come and join the&nbsp;fun!</p>
<p><em>Where have you seen <span class="caps">NASA</span> do something unique and awesome online
recently? Let us know so we can add it to the&nbsp;list!</em></p>
