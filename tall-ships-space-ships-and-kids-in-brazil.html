						<p>… a great mix! Starting June 15, the Tocorime’ Pamatojare, Brazil’s
largest sailing ship, will host the kick off of “<a href="http://followingdarwin.tocorime.net/TOCORIME_-_FOLLOWING_DARWIN_EXPEDITION/EXPEDITION.html">Following Darwin</a>”,
an environmentally focused educational outreach expedition along the
coast of Brazil. For five days in June in Rio de Janeiro harbor, school
kids, teachers, community leaders, and the public will be welcomed
aboard to see and hear about the upcoming voyage of the Tocorime’
Pamatojare, which means “Adventurous Spirit” in Portuguese, to sail to
the ports of call of the <span class="caps">HMS</span> Beagle. The theme of the expedition is
Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development as it relates to
the coastal environs of Brazil. These events, exhibits, and public talks
coincide with the <a href="http://www.uncsd2012.org/">United Nations Rio +20 Conference on Sustainable
Development</a>.</p>
<p>Publicly available astronaut photography taken aboard the International
Space Station (<span class="caps">ISS</span>) will provide the big view; showing off the beauty of
the Brazilian coast while helping to link the ecosystems, marine
biology, and oceanography with coastal development. Astronauts such as
<a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/barratt-mr.html">Mike Barratt</a> add the human exploration perspective, linking the
crews of the <span class="caps">ISS</span> to the crews of the tall ships and the Beagle’s voyage
180 years&nbsp;ago.</p>
<p>The educational and public outreach events in Brazil are just one
example of the growing use of astronaut photography  to teach and learn
about life on Earth. The image collections are cataloged and maintained
by the Crew Earth Observation <span class="caps">ISS</span> payload team at Johnson Space Center
and the <a href="">Astromaterials Research and Explorations Science (<span class="caps">ARES</span>)
Directorate</a>. Through the <a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov%20">Gateway to Astronaut Photography</a>, the
public can find collections such as Earth from Space, images from the
International Polar Year, or the wildly popular [time sequence videos of
auroras, city lights, coastal regions, and celestial&nbsp;phenomena][].</p>
<p>In September 2009, a team of marine biologists and oceanographers from
around South America, the <span class="caps">UK</span>, and the <span class="caps">US</span> met in Paraty, Brazil for the
first educational outreach event aboard the Tocorime’ and in area
schools. Organized by the <a href="http://www.hmsbeagleproject.org"><span class="caps">HMS</span> Beagle Project</a>, a <span class="caps">UK</span> charity, the
event also featured <span class="caps">NASA</span> astronaut photography and a live ham-radio call
from Mike Barratt on the <span class="caps">ISS</span> to the kids of Paraty. The event was a
great success with a variety of hands-on marine biology experiences for
the kids, including <span class="caps">DNA</span> sequencing of marine organisms in Paraty harbor
led by a biologist from the <a href="http://www.barcodeoflife.org/">Barcode of Life Project</a>. More such
events are planned for Following Darwin as it begins to circumnavigate
South America beginning in&nbsp;September.</p>
<p>Partners for the Rio+20 events include the host educational institution
<span class="caps">IASEA</span> (Institutio Para Aprendizagem Social, Emocional e Academica) and
the tall-ship <a href="www.tocorime.net%20">Tocorime’</a>, the University of Sao Paolo – Zoology
Museum and Oceanographic Institute, the Brazilian Ministry of the
Environment and Ministry of Culture, National Geographic-Brazil, the
British Council, and the <span class="caps">HMS</span> Beagle Project. Once again, <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s
astronaut photography and science education and outreach programs will
play a&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>Astronaut photography also serves as a focal point for <a href="http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/eeab">Expedition Earth
and Beyond</a>. This <span class="caps">NASA</span>/<span class="caps">JSC</span>/<span class="caps">ARES</span> education program is designed to
facilitate student-driven, authentic research projects to study the
Earth and to compare Earth to other planetary bodies such as the Moon
and Mars. Images of Earth acquired by astronauts are the hook for
getting students interested and involved in the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>The future looks bright for all of these partners; greater involvement
of <span class="caps">NASA</span> public resources from the <span class="caps">ISS</span>, a possible circumnavigation of
South America on a tall-ship following the voyage of Darwin’s Beagle,
and opportunities for thousands of kids to learn about the importance of
Earth science, protection of the environment, and sustainable living.
Tall-ships, space ships, and kids learning about the Earth; a great mix&nbsp;indeed!</p>
<p><strong>Hope you&#8217;ll stay tuned and follow the adventure!</strong><em>We&#8217;ll be following
the Tocorime&#8217;s explorations over the next few weeks - feel free to leave
a note here to share with the crew and the students. You can also follow
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/followdarwin">@followdarwin</a> on Twitter for ongoing updates of Dan&#8217;s adventures
with the&nbsp;expedition.</em></p>
