</header>					<div class="article_content">
						<p>Every once and awhile, we all need to be reminded about why we are here
and why we do what we do. A few weeks ago, the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government team
visited the football stadium at <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a> to take some time
out of all the things we are working on to do just that. While sitting
on the 40-yard line, near the spot where <span class="caps">JFK</span> gave his historic “<em>We
Choose the Moon</em>” <a href="http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm">speech</a>, we collectively took turns re-reading
those historic&nbsp;words.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>We meet at a college noted for knowledge,
in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we
stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and
challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and
ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our
ignorance&nbsp;unfolds.</em></span></p>
<p>The words struck a chord with us all. The simple exercise of reading
Kennedy&#8217;s speech with a group so committed to changing the world, and
knowing that there really are ways to contribute to that legacy, was&nbsp;sobering.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>If this capsule history of our progress
teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and
progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space
will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great
adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of
other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for&nbsp;space.</em></span></p>
<p>That day served as a reminder about why we have all committed our lives
to public service, to advancing space exploration, in pursuit of making
the world a better place - for reasons much bigger then&nbsp;ourselves.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because
they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the
best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we
are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which
we intend to win, and the others,&nbsp;too.</em></span></p>
<p><span class="caps">JFK</span> inspired the nation in 1962, which is 50 years ago this September
12th. As we prepare to celebrate the upcoming anniversary, we
intentionally reflected on what his words mean to us today and asked
ourselves some challenging questions. When <span class="caps">JFK</span> said “We will do these
things not because they are easy but because they are hard” what does
that mean to us? What is the modern corollary? Is it something we are
committed&nbsp;to?</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>This is a breathtaking pace, and such a
pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance,
new problems, new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise
high costs and hardships, as well as high&nbsp;reward.</em></span></p>
<p>For me, this is what Open Government at <span class="caps">NASA</span> is all about. Open
Government is critical to truly fulfilling our Agency’s mission. It’s
more then just embracing the latest technology, or even diligently
working to improve the way we do business inside government. It’s at the
core of everything we do. It’s ultimately about envisioning a future
that is so different than today that you are literally laughed out of
the room when first mentioning it. For this very reason, we often talk
about what the end goal of Open Government looks like amongst friends,
<em>close friends</em>. But in a moment of full transparency, let me share one
potential future state with you. We truly envision an agency that is
“<em>open by default</em>.” This applies to everything we do. When we write a
new contract or award a grant, we share the data by default. When we
write new code, it&#8217;s open source by default. When we institute a new
program or project, its participatory by default. When we work, it’s
collaborative by default. Of course there will always be things that an
Agency does that it cannot immediately make “<em>open</em>”, but we believe
these things are much more the exception then the norm at <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>We set sail on this new sea because there
is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must
be won and used for the progress of all&nbsp;people.</em></span></p>
<p>We know that this is very different then the Agency we work at today –
and even talking about being so open, transparency, participatory and
collaborative makes many around us very uneasy. We know that there are
seemingly insurmountable obstacles that must be overcome that require
unlimited patience and persistence. We know that a vision like this sets
us firmly in the minority and that the odds against achieving something
like this not in our favor.  We know that we will always be working too
fast for comfort inside the agency and not fast enough for those on the&nbsp;outside.</p>
<p>This is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">exactly</span> why we
believe what we are doing in terms of Open Government at <span class="caps">NASA</span> is
potentially one of the greatest missions the agency has ever&nbsp;undertaken.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><em>Well, space is there, and we&#8217;re going to
climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for
knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask
God&#8217;s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest
adventure on which man has ever&nbsp;embarked.</em></span></p>
<p><strong>We hope you will consider joining&nbsp;us.</strong></p>
