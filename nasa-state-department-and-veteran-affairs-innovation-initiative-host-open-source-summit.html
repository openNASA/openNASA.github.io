						<p><a href="http://open.nasa.gov/summit">Registration</a> for the second Open Source Summit, hosted by <span class="caps">NASA</span>, the
<span class="caps">U.S.</span> State Department and the Veteran Affairs Innovation Initiative to
advance the use of open source software in government, is under way. The
event will be held June 20-21 at the Robert H. Smith School of Business
at the University of Maryland in College Park,&nbsp;Md.</p>
<p>The summit will convene leaders from government and industry as well as
software practitioners to discuss the development, release and use of
open source software, which is characterized by a collaborative
development process and free user&nbsp;access.</p>
<p>Discussion topics will include the current and future state of the
government open source community, how-to insights for open source
projects in government, real-world projects and their successes and
challenges, and government procurement of open source&nbsp;software.</p>
<p>As the role of open source in government expands and matures, the
relationship between technology, policy and culture will be increasingly
important. Open source brings numerous benefits to government software
projects, including increased software quality, reduced development
costs, faster development cycles and reduced barriers to public-private
collaboration through new opportunities to commercialize technology.
This inherently transparent, participatory, and collaborative approach
is revolutionizing the way software is created, improved and&nbsp;used.</p>
