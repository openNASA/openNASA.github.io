						<p>We&#8217;re excited to announce the release of &#8220;39A&#8221;, an updated version of
the software used to power the 2013 <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">International Space Apps
Challenge</a>*, a global hackathon focusing on space technology and
issues. 39A is an online collaboration platform designed to help your
community take ‘giant leaps’ forward in addressing your challenges and
meeting your mission goals. It is easily customizable with your own
graphics and branding and the platform is intended to be an
inspirational launch pad for your&nbsp;collaborations!</p>
<p>We developed this open innovation platform to enable collaborative
problem solving around a shared challenge. Our goal was to directly
involve and empower citizens in our exploration mission, evolve
government to be more efficient and effective by creating a vehicle for
open innovation and worldwide participation, and accelerate the
development of innovative new&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p>The software is customized for management of global mass collaborations
or large-scale hackathons like the International Space Apps Challenge.
It can be used for multiple events, it will scale to include hundreds of
locations and thousands of participants, it&#8217;s flexible enough to create
challenge pages supported with data and other resources, and most
importantly, it seamlessly supports a truly global collaboration between
participants in physical locations as well as those participating&nbsp;virtually.</p>
<p>39A is released under an Apache 2.0 license and built on top of Django,
a high-level Python Web framework. The theme is a clean, responsive
design and takes advantage of modern web standards. A summary of the
major features is included below. You can download the software

39A, and the entire International Space Apps Challenge, was a labor of
love by so many.  These few thousand lines of code were greatly
influenced by the entire <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Innovation Program team especially
the project manager Ali Llewellyn, and the heavily lifting was performed
by the amazing Sean Herron and William&nbsp;Eshagh.</p>
<p>* On 20-21 April 2013, over 9,000 people around the world participated
in one of the galaxy&#8217;s largest mass collaborations ever - the
International Space Apps Challenge. To learn more about the
International Space Apps Challenge and to get involved in the 2014
event, visit&nbsp;http://spaceappschallenge.org/.</p>
