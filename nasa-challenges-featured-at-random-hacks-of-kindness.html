						<p><em>One of the key elements of the Random Hacks of Kindness Sustainability
Project announced earlier this year was to create a <a href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/rhok-featured-problem-set-june-2012">featured problem
set</a> for each RHoK event going forward that provides a series of
highly curated, well-defined problems that have clear sponsors and clear
paths to sustained impact. Stay on top of the latest additions for RHoK
2012 at our <a href="http://www.rhok.org/FeaturedProblems">Featured Problem Set Page</a>. Here we detail <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s two
focused challenges for the RHoK community, both building off of the
success of the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>. </em></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/complete-view-iss">Complete View from <span class="caps">ISS</span></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> We have an amazing amount of crew imagery coming down
daily from the International Space Station - time lapse images, star
trails views, and spectacular photos that give citizens of Earth an
unparalleled perspective of their home planet. Astronaut photography is
a vital resource that <span class="caps">NASA</span> is committed to making accessible and useful
internally and&nbsp;externally.</p>
<p>Our goal is to build an immersive view from the <span class="caps">ISS</span> in any direction,
nadir, limb-ward and star-ward, as the views are available. We want to
create a mechanism to allow organizing/tagging/crowdsourcing of
information that would improve the usability of the imagery for science
and educational projects. We want to create an OpenStreetMap-type
database that’s actually an&nbsp;“OpenStarMap.”</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong> The impact of this app is limited only by your
imagination. You are providing everyone an opportunity to see and engage
with our home planet with a perspective so far only available to a few
hundred human beings. Who knows how the orbital perspective could shape
life for the rest of&nbsp;us?</p>
<p><strong>After RHoK:</strong> The Human Exploration Science Office is committed to
these goals and the accessibility of these images. Apps that meet the
requirements in a clean and easy-to-use way have a likelihood of
adoption in <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s citizen science/open data&nbsp;efforts.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/phonesat-android-apps-space">PhoneSat: Android Apps for&nbsp;Space</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> This challenge is a chance to be a part of
kick-starting the public’s access to space – and using open source <span class="caps">COTS</span>
technology to do so. PhoneSat is a low-cost Cubesat using a Google Nexus
Smartphone running the open source Android platform as the main
processor. Our challenge for you is to create an Android App that
utilizes PhoneSat’s&nbsp;capabilities.</p>
<p>The App that you create should be designed to run during a dedicated
mission phase lasting approximately one 90 minute orbital period; you
could choose to use any portion or all of this time. During this phase
you would have access to all of the phone sensors: magnetometer,
gyroscope, and accelerometer in addition to the PhoneSat sensors and
controls: thermometer, reaction wheels, magnetorquer boards, and solar
panel&nbsp;current.</p>
<p>There are unique challenges to developing apps and receiving data in a
microgravity environment. These conditions will alter the performance of
PhoneSat’s sensors. Half of your testing orbit will be in eclipse, which
will be responsible for a thermal cycle. Atmospheric drag will be the
primary source of attitude disturbance. The Earth’s magnetic field at
the orbit altitude would have a similar magnitude to that at sea level.
Finally, the satellite may be tumbling with the determination of an
approximate&nbsp;attitude.</p>
<p>Are you up for the&nbsp;challenge?</p>
<p><strong>The Impact:</strong> These apps have the potential to impact the burgeoning
commercial space industry and be an early influencer in approaches to
citizen science in microgravity. This is relatively unexplored territory
– and you get to be a part of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>After RHoK:</strong> The PhoneSat Project team, based at the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Ames
Research Center, is committed to engaging citizens in their efforts to
test and fly these apps in space. Apps that meet the requirements in a
creative and effective way are likely to have an opportunity to fly in
space in the near future. More info on the plans for the project are
found here: <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/phonesat/">http://open.nasa.gov/plan/phonesat/</a></p>
