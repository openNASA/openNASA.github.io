						<p><em>This is an article I originally published on 09/03/2010, but the advice
is still very timely today so I updated and reposted here.<br />
</em><br />
One of the great things about new digital platforms like open.<span class="caps">NASA</span> is
that they allow us to easily connect, share, discover and expand our
experiences.  This includes sharing with each other those experiences
that inspire us and impact the way we see the world.  I thought I’d
share a talk I heard while attending the <span class="caps">MBA</span> program at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">University
of Texas</a> by entrepreneur, Gary Hoover.  Hoover created
<a href="http://www.hoovers.com/">Hoovers.com</a>, the world’s largest Internet-based provider of
information about enterprises and is also well know for essentially
creating the big box bookstore we know today.  His pioneering venture,
Bookstop, was eventually sold to Barnes <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Noble and became a cornerstone
for their industry-dominating superstore chain. Hoover is the
“<em>Entrepreneur-in-Residence</em>” at McCombs Business School and spends much
of his time today sharing his experience about creating and building
lasting enterprises and inspiring students to do the&nbsp;same.</p>
<p>Hoover speaks regularly and always includes a list of 8 key ideas on how
to create successful enterprises - a list that he has refined throughout
his career. He’s shared this list over 700 times on every continent but
Antarctica.  This list is also the topic of a book he wrote in 2001,
called “<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hoovers-Vision-Original-Thinking-Business/dp/1587990598">Hoover’s Vision: Original Thinking for Business Success.</a></em>”
The rest of this post includes the detailed list (as posted on <a href="http://hooversworld.com/archives/2923">Hoover’s
personal website</a>) and a link to his webinar and the slides.  My hope
in sharing this with you today is to spread these great ideas further,
challenge us all to think differently, and inspire us to continue to do
things that amplify our impact and&nbsp;reach.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #993300;">Gary Hoovers 8 Keys to Creating and
Building Lasting&nbsp;Enterprises</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">1.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Curiosity</span></strong><span style="color: #993300;">
— nothing is ever discovered by looking in the same place as everyone
else, or looking in the same way as everyone else.  All discovery starts
with exploration. Ask a</span><em><span
style="color: #993300;">lot</span></em><span style="color: #993300;"> of
questions. Go beyond the first “why.” Study the mundane, the
“everyday.” Travel, observe, talk to people. Read, go to concerts, try
new things. Look at other industries. The answers are rarely where you
expect to find them. Opportunities are&nbsp;everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">2.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">History</span></strong><span style="color: #993300;"> —
you can’t know where you are going if you don’t know where you are
coming from.  Watching key long-term trends is a critical part of
successful leadership.  What are some of the trends to watch today? What
large demographic shifts are at work? What can be learned from the
leaders of the past, including those in your own industry and&nbsp;company?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">3.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Geography</span></strong><span style="color: #993300;">
— we all come from somewhere, we all grew up somewhere.  In a shrinking
world, it is more important than ever to understand people and
places. Do you know the population of your metropolitan area? Do you
know the growth rates of your county and surrounding counties? Do you
know what is going on in countries around the world, which places are
rising and falling and why? What are people leaving some places and
moving to&nbsp;others?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">(I believe the above three mindsets are
the keys to dreaming up innovative new ideas that relate to the real
needs of real people.  Once you have a mission in mind, the points below
kick into&nbsp;gear.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">4.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Clarity of Vision</span></strong><span
style="color: #993300;"> — can any third-grader understand your vision?
 Or are you trapped in double-speak and buzzwords, an alphabet soup of
acronyms, and&nbsp;jargon?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">5.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Consistency of Vision</span></strong><span
style="color: #993300;"> — do you stick to what you are good at and what
you believe in, through thick and thin? Do you have a
consistent</span><em><span style="color: #993300;">purpose</span></em><span
style="color: #993300;">?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">6.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Service</span></strong><span style="color: #993300;"> —
the only valid reason for the existence of an enterprise is to deliver
products and services to people, to somehow make the world a better
place. The minute you think that power resides in the boardroom or in
Washington, or that your company can be made great through making good
deals or acquisitions, rather than through focusing on the customers,
you are most likely at the beginning of the end. Serving others well
must be the top priority – your other stakeholders including suppliers,
community, investors, and employees will then have something to&nbsp;share.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">7.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Unique Vision</span></strong><span
style="color: #993300;"> — do you sound and look like all your
competitors or do you stand out, following a unique path that is true to
your enterprise and your soul? Differentiation is the&nbsp;key.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;">8.</span><strong><span
style="color: #993300;">Passion</span></strong><span style="color: #993300;"> —
if you aren’t doing something you love, you will never be the best at&nbsp;it!</span></p>
