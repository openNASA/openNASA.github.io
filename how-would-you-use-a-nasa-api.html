						<p>One of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#open-data-default">major focuses</a> of <a href="http://whitehouse.gov/digitalgov">President Obama&#8217;s Digital
Strategy</a> is to encourage the development and use of <span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s for service
delivery from government agencies. For those of you who are unfamiliar
with <span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s, this <a href="http://www.quora.com/APIs/What-is-an-API-in-layman-terms">Quora thread</a> provides a good description. In short,
<span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s provide an interface for machines to talk with each other. A good
example would be the Disqus comments openNASA uses. By plugging in to
their <span class="caps">API</span>, we are able to offer their commenting mechanism on our site.
Simple,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p><span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s offer a lot of promise for <span class="caps">NASA</span>. We gather a lot of data - about
15 Terabytes per day! That means we brought down almost 2 gigabytes in
just the time it took you to read this sentence. Future missions like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy_Space_Telescope">Destiny</a> could collected 24 Terabytes per day <em>all on their own</em>. As
Nick outlined <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/10/04/what-is-nasa-doing-with-big-data-today/">last week</a>, as we collect more and more data, figuring
out the best way to distribute, use, and reuse the data becomes more and
more difficult. <span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s are one way we can significantly lower the barrier
of entry to people from outside <span class="caps">NASA</span> being able to manipulate and access
our public&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re just getting started with APIs, our biggest being the <a href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info">open data
<span class="caps">API</span></a> we launched just about one year ago. As part of the digital
strategy, we&#8217;re committed to making more <span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s available
(or highlighting the awesome work other people have done to create
<span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s, like the folks at <a href="http://exoapi.com/">ExoAPI</a> who created one for Kepler exoplanet
data as part of the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">International Space Apps Challenge</a>). We need
your help, though! As we work to share the value of APIs with other&#8217;s
around the agency, we&#8217;d love use cases and reasons why the public would
value being able to access <span class="caps">NASA</span> data via an <span class="caps">API</span>. Have an idea? Want to
create something, but need an easier way to access our data to use it?
Want a particular dataset <span class="caps">API</span>-ized? Let us know! Any comments or
feedback you can provide would be immensely helpful as we continue our
quest towards a more transparent, collaborative, and participatory
agency. Either give your comments below, or email them to me at
<a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#115;&#101;&#97;&#110;&#46;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#110;&#97;&#115;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;">&#115;&#101;&#97;&#110;&#46;&#104;&#101;&#114;&#114;&#111;&#110;&#64;&#110;&#97;&#115;&#97;&#46;&#103;&#111;&#118;</a> if you&#8217;d rather not share publicly. Thanks for
your&nbsp;help!</p>
