						<p>Do you follow any astronauts on Twitter mainly for their photos of Earth
from space? Did you know they’re taking those pictures from a space
station that travels 5 miles per second? Now there’s an app that
calculates photo ops and conditions for photographs, making it much
easier for them to capture those photos we all&nbsp;love.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked up and wondered where that space station is? Now,
you can use one of many apps to tell you exactly when the space station
orbits overhead, and you don’t even need a&nbsp;telescope.</p>
<p>Or have you wondered where on Mars the Curiosity Rover is right now, and
how cold it must be? Now, you can find that out from your phone. Sol,
the world’s first interplanetary weather app, is now available for&nbsp;download.</p>
<p><em>Where did all these amazing apps and APIs come&nbsp;from?</em></p>
<p>Over the past year since the launch of the Digital Government Strategy,
<span class="caps">NASA</span> has made its data and services more and more accessible to the
world. Through technology development events such as the International
Space Apps Challenge and the National Day of Civic Hacking, developers,
researchers, entrepreneurs, and citizens like you have shaped that data
into apps and APIs that more closely connect us to our planet and our&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p>At <span class="caps">NASA</span>, most of our questions are rooted in one commitment: to explore,
and to connect everyone on Earth to that exploration. How do we make
space data more alive and tangible to&nbsp;everyone?</p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> is extremely committed to implementing directives such as the
Digital Government Strategy, the Open Government Initiative, and the new
Open Data Executive Order. Together, these three directives are
important steps forward for government agencies like <span class="caps">NASA</span>. They
encourage agencies to open up their valuable data to the public and give
external developers tools to build new technology and services. They
enable us to keep pace with the rapid deployment of mobile technology
and rising citizen expectations, and ensure our technology is available
to citizens anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Most importantly, at
the core of these initiatives is a new approach to how government works
and delivers its services to the American&nbsp;people.</p>
<p>In support of the anniversary, <span class="caps">NASA</span> has updated the status of all the
milestones for the Digital Strategy, released a number of new mobile
applications, made more data available through APIs, and created a page
for developers looking for more information. We encourage you to check
out the following related links. We’ve also included some notable
Digital Strategy highlights&nbsp;below.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Notable Digital Strategy&nbsp;Highlights</h3>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">data.nasa.gov <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;code.nasa.gov</span></h4>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> engages with the public through a variety of avenues, but perhaps
the most relevant to the Digital Strategy initiative is our commitment
to open data and open source software. Two platforms, data.nasa.gov and
code.nasa.gov, serve as the home for the Agency&#8217;s efforts in these
areas. Code.nasa.gov expands <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s open source activities, surfaces
existing activities, and guides internal and external groups in open
development, release, and contribution. In doing so, <span class="caps">NASA</span> hopes to lower
barriers to building open technology in partnership with the public.
Data.nasa.gov is <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s flagship platform for sharing information about
the vast stores of data we collect and store, with over 100 years of
<span class="caps">U.S.</span> aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists, and many others can contribute
directly to the exploration of space and Earth by bringing new
perspectives to the data. The Agency continues to work to improve data
accessibility and is actively incentivizing the use of government data
by citizens. To address the ever-increasing amount of tools and data
catalogs that are publicly available on <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s many websites, this
directory lists publicly available datasets and serves to streamline the
process for posting them on data.gov. The directory includes information
and direct links to more than 1,000&nbsp;datasets.</p>

<li><a href="http://code.nasa.gov/">code.nasa.gov</a></li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIs</span></h4>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> sees huge promise in web APIs, as they can enhance our ability to
deliver data to both established and new audiences. Although the Agency
offers petabytes of publicly available data to the world from a variety
of missions, only a small portion is accessible through <span class="caps">API</span> interfaces.
The Digital Strategy mandate directed <span class="caps">NASA</span> to use web APIs to make
available high-value data and content for at least two existing major
customer-facing systems. Examples of <span class="caps">NASA</span>-produced APIs&nbsp;include:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 dir="ltr"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Data <span class="caps">API</span></h5>
<p>The data.nasa.gov <span class="caps">API</span> allows a machine-readable interface to return
metadata from the site organized by category, tag, date, or search
term. We’re hoping this allows new and creative visualizations of the
data resources <span class="caps">NASA</span> provides to the public. Additionally, it is a
learning experience for us as we work to expand transparency,
participation, and collaboration at <span class="caps">NASA</span> through new uses of&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/">http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Earth Observing System (<span class="caps">EOS</span>) Clearinghouse (<span class="caps">ECHO</span>)</h5>
<p>The <span class="caps">NASA</span>-developed Earth Observing System (<span class="caps">EOS</span>) Clearinghouse (<span class="caps">ECHO</span>)
is a spatial and temporal metadata registry and order broker built by
<span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Earth Science Data and Information System (<span class="caps">ESDIS</span>) that enables
the science community to more easily use and exchange <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s data and
services. <span class="caps">ECHO</span>&#8217;s main objective is to enable broader use of <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">EOS</span>
data. It allows users to more efficiently search and access data and
services, and increases the potential for interoperability with new
tools and services. The value of these resources increases with the
potential to exchange and interoperate. <span class="caps">ECHO</span> has been working with
other organizations to provide their Earth science metadata alongside
<span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s for users to search and access. <span class="caps">ECHO</span> stores metadata from a
variety of science disciplines and domains, including Climate
Variability and Change, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Earth Surface and
Interior, Atmospheric Composition, Weather, and Water and Energy&nbsp;Cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/">http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Heliocentric Trajectories Web&nbsp;Services</h5>
<p>An <span class="caps">API</span> offering heliocentric trajectories for selected spacecraft,
planets, and&nbsp;comets.</p>
<p><a href="http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/">http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Satellite Situation Center <span class="caps">API</span></h5>
<p>The Satellite Situation Center (<span class="caps">SSC</span>) web services allow a software
developer to use portions of the <span class="caps">SSC</span> software in their own
applications. <span class="caps">SSC</span> is a system to cast geocentric spacecraft location
information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions and
mappings of spacecraft locations along lines of the Earth&#8217;s magnetic
field. This capability is one key to mission science planning (both
single missions and coordinated observations of multiple spacecraft
with ground-based investigations) and to subsequent multi-mission data&nbsp;analysis.</p>
<p><a href="http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/">http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Coordinated Data Analysis System (<span class="caps">CDAS</span>) Web&nbsp;Services</h5>
<p>The Coordinated Data Analysis System (<span class="caps">CDAS</span>) web services allow a
software developer to use <span class="caps">CDAS</span> services in their own applications.
<span class="caps">CDAS</span> supports simultaneous multi-mission, multi-instrument selection
and comparison of science data among a wide range of current space
missions. While CDAWeb provides access to this data through an
<span class="caps">HTML</span>-based user interface, these web services provides a (web)
application programming interface (<span class="caps">API</span>) to <span class="caps">CDAS</span>. If you are developing
an application that requires science data from any <span class="caps">CDAS</span>-held datasets,
then the <span class="caps">CDAS</span> web services will provide an interface to the data for
your&nbsp;application.</p>
<p><a href="http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/">http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>With constrained budgetary resources and the large, complex, and legacy
systems our data is housed in, however, relying solely on <span class="caps">NASA</span> data
owners to release APIs is not the best approach to opening our data to
the world. Thus, our strategy has been to launch a series of challenges
and collaboration opportunities to enable citizen developers around the
world to help us in our quest to further the transparency and
accessibility of <span class="caps">NASA</span> data systems. Events like the International Space
Apps Challenge create opportunities for thousands of citizen developers
from across the planet to contribute their time, and help the agency
create front-end APIs for many of our legacy data&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> has hosted two International Space Apps Challenge events, the first
in April 2012 and the second in April 2013. In the 2013 event, over
9,100 participants at over 83 cities around the world created 770
unique, open source solutions for a series of challenges the agency
issued. The challenges varied in scope and subject, from creating data
visualizations to designing more efficient air traffic control systems
to creating new <span class="caps">API</span> interfaces for legacy datasets. With relatively
little investment from the Agency, dozens of unique APIs were born out
of the initiative, many of which are listed below. Going forward, <span class="caps">NASA</span>
hopes to hold more events like the International Space Apps Challenge in
collaboration with our own internal efforts. In adopting these APIs, we
can harness the power of citizen collaboration to assist us in reaching
our&nbsp;goals.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Optimized Mobile&nbsp;Services</h4>
<p>As mobile devices continue to count for a larger percentage of overall
web traffic in the <span class="caps">US</span>, <span class="caps">NASA</span> has strived to offer a variety of services
in mobile friendly offerings, including via specialized mobile
applications, mobile optimized websites, and <span class="caps">SMS</span> gateways. The Digital
Strategy mandate directed <span class="caps">NASA</span> to optimize at least two existing
priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for
improving additional existing services. As with the APIs, however,
constrained budgetary resources have contributed to an environment in
which relying solely on <span class="caps">NASA</span> programs to release mobile interfaces is
not the best approach to furthering this objective. Increasing
accessibility for our services and optimizing them for mobile users is
ongoing work that will continue far into the future. Here are six
examples of recently optimized services developed by <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 dir="ltr"><span class="caps">NASA</span>&nbsp;Mobile</h5>
<p>The <span class="caps">NASA</span> app is the public’s window to the universe. The free app,
which aggregates a variety of <span class="caps">NASA</span> web content, services and
individual apps, and also includes a mobile-optimized website, is
available for iPhone and Android devices. It offers live streaming
<span class="caps">NASA</span> Television coverage of agency missions and events, showcases more
than 11,000 images of Earth, the solar system and beyond and even lets
users track the International Space Station and learn when the
orbiting laboratory will fly over their&nbsp;home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">WebTADS&nbsp;Mobile</h5>
<p>WebTADS Mobile is a lighter version of the desktop-based WebTADS
developed to provide <span class="caps">NASA</span> civil servants with the convenience of
