						<p>Open source software development allows free access to software source
code to allow anyone to make improvements and is revolutionizing the way
software is created, improved, and used. The open source software
movement is inherently transparent, participatory, and collaborative.
Open source at <span class="caps">NASA</span> gives the public direct and ongoing access to <span class="caps">NASA</span>
technology. Its adoption by <span class="caps">NASA</span> also helps lower the barrier to entry
into space by enabling private industry to better make use of <span class="caps">NASA</span>&nbsp;investments.</p>
<p>A major goal of the Open Government Office is to work to establish a
comprehensive open source policy within the agency that enables
innovation and collaboration between both <span class="caps">NASA</span> employees, contractors,
and the public.This would shift our open source activities from its
one-way direction of giving the public access to finalized software
products, to allowing two-way collaboration as part of the development
process. The benefits of allowing the public to assist in development of
<span class="caps">NASA</span> software include increased software quality, accelerated software
development, and a higher rate of technology transfer both to and from
<span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>

<p>In March 2011, <span class="caps">NASA</span> hosted an Open Source Summit at Ames Research
Center. Focused on addressing the core challenges <span class="caps">NASA</span> is encountering
behind open source development and producing real, actionable solutions,
the Summit brought together many of the best minds in development from
both inside and outside the agency. Over 600 in-person and virtual
attendees collaborated on a variety of issues including <span class="caps">ITAR</span> policies,
governance, and risk&nbsp;assessments.</p>
