<p>A few months back, Open.Gov Team Lead, Nick Skytland approached me with
an idea to implement <a href="http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/" title="Google - Liquid Galaxy">Google&#8217;s Liquid Galaxy</a> project at <span class="caps">NASA</span>.  I was
immediately intrigued by the idea, and set forth researching what would
be involved.  Nick and I collaborated with others at Johnson Space
Center (<span class="caps">JSC</span>) to come up with a way to implement our own Liquid Galaxy.
 We also collaborated with people from other <span class="caps">NASA</span> centers to come up
with ideas to extend the project&#8217;s functionality, and to apply the same
hardware to other activities.  In the end, we came up with an exciting
eight-display Liquid Galaxy &#8220;immersive cave&#8221; and a number of ideas to
consider for the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Early on, we sought to participate with the <span class="caps">JSC</span> Innovation Team, and
were successful in being selected as one of 20 innovation projects they
wanted to see implemented.  This gave us access to other innovators in
the center, to collaborate with, and better utilize available resources.
 Thankfully, we were able to get an early start on hardware acquisition,
which proved to be the most critical scheduling component for almost all
of the 20 innovation projects.  Over the course of six months or so, we
were able to participate in a variety of innovation activities around
<span class="caps">JSC</span>, including a Maker Camp, and several innovation project progress
presentations - which gave us great insight into the brilliant minds and
ideas others brought to the 2011 <span class="caps">JSC</span> innovation&nbsp;effort.</p>
<p>During our project&#8217;s implementation, we collaborated with a variety of
people on different aspects of the task.  During the two day <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/13/nasa-forward-maker-camp-2/" title="NASA Forward - Maker Camp"><span class="caps">NASA</span>
Forward - Maker Camp</a> in August, people from <a href="http://spacelifesciences.nasa.gov" title="Space Life Sciences Directorate">Space Life Sciences</a>
and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/" title="Engineering Directorate">Engineering Directorates</a> joined in with designing an 80/20-based
rack system to mount the hardware vertically.  This particular solution
gave us a configuration that will work for either a <a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Groups/VisTech/hyperwall/">HyperWall</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Automatic_Virtual_Environment" title="Immersive Cave Technology">Immersive Cave</a> configuration of the Liquid Galaxy.  We also worked
with people from <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/people/orgs/" title="JSC People">Mission Operations Directorate</a> and the new
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/c3po/home/" title="Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office">Commercial Crew <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Cargo Program Office</a> (<span class="caps">C3PO</span>) to overcome hurdles we
encountered with system configuration and&nbsp;optimization.</p>
<p>To get an idea of what we could do beyond Liquid Galaxy, we talked with
a variety of teams involved in graphical simulation projects at
different <span class="caps">NASA</span> centers around the country.  Our first conversation was
with the group responsible for <a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/" title="NASA WorldWind"><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s World Wind</a> project at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/" title="Ames Research Center - ARC">Ames
Research Center</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=NASA+Ames+Research+Center,+Moffett+Field,+CA+94035&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=37.409846,-122.063427&amp;sspn=0.156805,0.139217&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;t=h&amp;z=15" title="Google Map of NASA ARC">Moffett Field, <span class="caps">CA</span></a>, who we had met earlier this
year at the <span class="caps">NASA</span> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/source/" title="Open Source Summit (OSS)">Open Source Summit</a>.  We also talked with the <a href="http://vrlab.jsc.nasa.gov" title="Virtual Reality Lab"><span class="caps">VR</span>
Lab Team</a> at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/" title="Johnson Space Center">Johnson Space Center</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=johnson+space+center&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=29.561662,-95.093708&amp;spn=0.042032,0.034804&amp;sll=37.415228,-122.06265&amp;sspn=0.039198,0.034804&amp;vpsrc=0&amp;t=h&amp;z=15" title="Google Map of JSC">Houston, <span class="caps">TX</span></a>, who created
<span class="caps">DOUG</span> - a 3D viewing tool used in training for space walks as well as
shuttle and station robotic arm operations.  Finally, we have spent the
most time discussing opportunities with the team responsible for <span class="caps">GMAT</span>,
the <a href="http://gmat.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="GMAT">General Mission Analysis Tool</a>, from <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/" title="GSFC">Goddard Space Flight
Center</a> in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Goddard+Space+Flight+Center,+Goddard,+Maryland&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=38.997308,-76.850824&amp;spn=0.038356,0.034804&amp;sll=38.997308,-76.85149&amp;sspn=0.018778,0.017402&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;t=h&amp;z=15" title="Google Map of GSFC">Greenbelt, <span class="caps">MD</span></a>.</p>
<p>Discussions with these groups looked at two different possibilities for
machine clustered HyperWall and Immersive Cave implementations.  The
first is similar to Google Earth&#8217;s implementation, where you run the
application on every machine, and have one configured as a controller
that sends data to the rest, and the others receive the controller&#8217;s
state data (position and attitude) and then draw their locations based
on offset values applied to the camera / screen position.  This requires
the software on every machine, and in the case of Google Earth, each
machine is requesting all of its own data from Google over the network -
in our case, eight times the bandwidth&nbsp;usage.</p>
<p>The second option is an innovative solution recently mentioned on
Google&#8217;s Liquid Galaxy page, by one of their three GSoC (Google Summer
of Code) Interns: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/wiki/GSoC2011_ClusterGL" title="ClusterGL on GSoC 2011">ClusterGL</a>.  ClusterGL is basically taking OpenGL,
an open source graphic library alternative to DirectX, and providing its
graphics <span class="caps">API</span> calls over the network so that other machines can draw the
graphics themselves, without needing application on their machine.  You
can run one copy of the program on one machine, and setup all the rest
to just draw additional screens of data to make the field of view
larger.  So far this technique shows the most promise, because you don&#8217;t
need to adapt an application to talk between multiple copies of itself
on the&nbsp;network.</p>
<p>So far our project has been met with great interest and enthusiasm on
site at Johnson Space Center.  People just can&#8217;t stop playing with the
Liquid Galaxy, flying around the Earth, Moon, and Mars, looking at all
of the graphic visualizations of the world in an Immersive Cave
environment.  If you are ever at <span class="caps">JSC</span>, come over to Building 29 and try
it out.  We look forward to working with <span class="caps">NASA</span> and external parties
interested in collaborating on clustered graphical simulation solutions
in the&nbsp;future.</p>
