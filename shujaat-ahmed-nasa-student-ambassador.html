						<p><em><span class="caps">NASA</span> recently accepted its fourth cohort of <a href="http://intern.nasa.gov/intern/">Student Ambassadors</a>.
These exceptional individuals engage their fellow undergraduate and
graduate students in <span class="caps">NASA</span> science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (<span class="caps">STEM</span>), as well as participate in research and immersion
opportunities. They collaborate with and inspire their peers, make
professional connections and represent <span class="caps">NASA</span> to the public. We have
invited some of them to share their stories here. This week, Shujaat
Ahmed, from the industrial/organizational psychology program at Illinois
Institute of Technology, describes her <span class="caps">NASA</span>&nbsp;experience. </em></p>
<p>When people think of <span class="caps">NASA</span>, they usually think of engineers or
scientists. Truth be told, there are other areas within <span class="caps">NASA</span> such as
<a href="http://nasapeople.nasa.gov/">human capital</a> that also support the mission. Having said that, I
think it is important to point out some of the work these lesser-known
areas do and the contributions that are made to the exploration mission.
I would like to start by highlighting some of my experiences and why it
is helpful to <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<p>To start off, I initially became involved in <span class="caps">NASA</span> after a friend who was
majoring in computer science told me he was interning at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory during the summer of 2008. Since then, I realized
<span class="caps">NASA</span> did have an <a href="https://intern.nasa.gov/solar/web/public/main/index.cfm?solarAction=view&amp;subAction=content&amp;contentCode=HOME_PAGE_INTERNSHIPS">internship program for students</a>. However, only
after I researched the web and found the website listed with various
opportunities (a couple of which were in my field), was I aware that I
could have a remote chance of being a <span class="caps">NASA</span> intern. Being a psychology
student, I felt unique during my two internship experiences in that I
was surrounded by mostly engineers but I was alright with it. While I
may not have understood difficult engineering concepts outside of my
major, I brought a different perspective to the table given my diverse
educational background and&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p>During my first internship in the summer of 2010, I conducted a study
examining the personality traits of <span class="caps">NASA</span> Marshall Space Flight Center
engineers and the impact that had on the structure and culture of the
organization. This study is important because it suggests that in order
for this organization to thrive and be effective in a business
environment that is characterized by change and competition, the
engineers need to be able to&nbsp;adapt.</p>
<p>My most recent internship during the summer of 2011 involved using
workforce analytics to guide succession planning within Goddard Space
Flight Center. Here I analyzed 10 years worth of data for the
engineering directorate to find gaps in the analyses and determine where
the directorate needed to fill the gaps. This work is important because
it has brought that directorate and <span class="caps">GSFC</span> one step closer to having a
formal succession plan in place. I am positive my work will help prepare
the engineering directorate and <span class="caps">GSFC</span> in identifying, assessing, and
developing employees to make certain they are ready to take on key roles
when the person higher up in their pipeline leaves, while ensuring
knowledge is successfully passed on to and retained by the employee
assuming the new key&nbsp;role.</p>
<p>In both of my internship experiences, I am honored to have played a role
(indirectly) in trying to keep <span class="caps">NASA</span> alive as an organization and to keep
moving forward. This is because of the influence and impact of the
internship projects I mentioned earlier have had in helping <span class="caps">NASA</span>
employees adapt during the economic turmoil and in retaining knowledge
for developing employees as they fill in new roles when a person leaves.
While I am excited to have been given opportunities to make an
impression, <em>my journey with <span class="caps">NASA</span> is not over yet</em>. In the future, I
hope to work at <span class="caps">NASA</span> fulltime, improving different areas within human
capital management, whether it is implementing more effective training
strategies, helping with employee productivity and engagement, or
something else. I want to continue supporting <span class="caps">NASA</span> because ever since I
became a part of this organization, the people around me have been very
kind, caring, and the climate and culture at <span class="caps">NASA</span> is&nbsp;priceless.</p>
<p>In closing, I hope my experiences have shed light on some of the work
that other areas, such as <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s office of human capital management are
involved in. More importantly, I hope I have provided some motivation to
people to stay focused and be engaged in <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s mission because <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s
best resource are its people and it is up to all of us to make a&nbsp;difference.</p>
