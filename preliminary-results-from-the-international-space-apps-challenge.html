						<p><em>111 orgs, 25 cities, 17 countries, 2,083 pple, 71 challenges, 100+
solutions in 48 hours.<br />
</em></p>
<p>This weekend, <span class="caps">NASA</span> successfully fulfilled a commitment on behalf of the
United States as part of the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/">Open Government Partnership</a> Domestic
Action Plan.  The stated goal of the event, per the <a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/www.opengovpartnership.org/files/country_action_plans/US_National_Action_Plan_Final_2.pdf"><span class="caps">US</span> Action Plan</a>,
was to &#8220;<em>promote innovation through international collaboration</em>&#8220;. Space
exploration was the ideal catalyst to foster this culture of innovation,
and <span class="caps">NASA</span>, in collaboration with <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/partners/">8 government agencies</a> and <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/partners/">103 other
organizations</a>, hosted the International Space
Apps Challenge in <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/locations/">25 cities</a> in 17 countries on all seven continents
and online.  The event held 21-22 April 2012 brought together 2,083
registered participants (ages 16-70) together to address <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">71
challenges</a>.  More than <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/solutions/">100 unique solutions</a> were developed in
less then 48 hours during the event.  All solutions were developed in a
completely open source environment, and each have their own unique
potential to go even further to address world and space technology&nbsp;challenges.</p>
<p>In addition to the technology developed, the event itself generated
considerable media coverage for the agency, resulting in <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/press/">72 English
articles</a>, including landing on the front of the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17791091"><span class="caps">BBC</span></a> website on 21
April 2012.  <a href="http://gov20radio.com/spaceapps/">Gov2.0Radio</a> provided special coverage for the event
which included 45 interviews with organizers, experts and participants
from all locations.  The entire event was streamed online to thousands
of people around the world, and although hard to measure the total
viewership, the twitter stream alone generated 3.3M&nbsp;impressions.</p>
<p>We have compiled a small cross-section of 11 examples, that represent
the quality of the technology developed. Over the next few days, we will
be featuring the top 50 <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/solutions/">solutions</a> on this
website and <a href="http://innovationendeavors.com/">Innovation Endeavours</a> and <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creative">Talenthouse</a> will start the
global judging&nbsp;process.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Predict the Sky</strong> - An app that combines <span class="caps">ISS</span>, <span class="caps">HST</span> and weather
forecast data for a specified location to inform people about what
they&#8217;ll be able to see in the night&nbsp;sky.</p>
<p><strong>Planet Hopper</strong> - An app that visualizes Kepler data to allow
children and teachers to explore all the exoplanets that we know&nbsp;about.</p>
<p><strong>MyTravelImpact </strong>- An app that uses <span class="caps">NASA</span> weather satellite data to
bring carbon footprint computation down to the individual level,
allowing trends to be associated with decisions people make based on
weather conditions and convenience of transportation options.  Further
application could include city planning based on climate change&nbsp;predictions.</p>
<p><strong>Growers Nation</strong> - A collaboration between developers in Exeter, San
Francisco, New York City, Santiago, Nairobi and Santo Domingo, that
explores the potential of unused land for the growing of fruit,
vegetable and other crops through the use of location, climate and
agriculture&nbsp;data.</p>
<p><strong>HazardMap</strong> - A real-time hazard map application that is powered by
social media observations to help provide a a useful risk assessment
for potential (and actual) crisis&nbsp;situations.</p>
<p><strong>Commonality of <span class="caps">NASA</span> Datasets</strong> - A data schema attempts to capture
the commonalities between datasets acquired by <span class="caps">NASA</span> to allow citizen
scientists and data mining softwares to quickly locate relevant
datasets required to answer questions posed in broad terms, such as
&#8220;Has the sea level risen in the last 10&nbsp;years?&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Aeration <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Low Temperature Baking</strong> - An energy efficient, self
sufficient process to produce ordinary, fresh bread with minimal
ingredients at lower, safer temperatures in a limited resource&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p><strong>Solar Wind Visualization</strong> - A desktop client that takes solar wind
speed live from the web and produces an animation of the current wind
speeds. The same feed is also used by an Arduino to show the live
intensity of the solar winds by lighting more lights the more intense
the&nbsp;winds.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Data <span class="caps">API</span></strong> - A preliminary design and schema for a <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Open Data <span class="caps">API</span> to improve accessibility and a unified interface to <span class="caps">NASA</span>
datasets without requiring specialist&nbsp;knowledge.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ISS</span> Open Hardware Design</strong> - An open hardware design that visualizes
the location of the <span class="caps">ISS</span> in space.  The distance is calculated and if
closer than 15,000km (ground projection) lights are turned on using an
Arduino. The closer the <span class="caps">ISS</span> the more lights that are lit topping out
at 10 lights when within&nbsp;0.5km.</p>
<p><strong>A View from Space</strong> - An app that restricts a shared social media
stream based on the orbit of the <span class="caps">ISS</span> in order to provide a common
viewpoint and build a community around space data based on&nbsp;location.</p>
