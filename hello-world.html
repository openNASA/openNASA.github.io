						<p>I am thankful for a lot of things in my life: my awesome family, my
amazing (now former) school and the supportive, kind group of friends I
am so fortunate to have, to name just a few. There is another item on my
list of thankfulness which would surprise most people. Before I
enlighten you as to what the mystery list item is, I’ll set the scene
and give some background on me. I’ve just finished high school in the
<span class="caps">UK</span>, and I’m a massive fan of Science and Maths as well as most Sci-Fi
and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Also, I’m Canadian-American, but usually
identify as Canadian (because Canadians are better at hockey). Anyway,
that mystery item from earlier is a 16 year old me tiredly checking the
Make Magazine blog late at night in 2011 and reading an article about
the first International Space Apps Challenge. Now I should emphasise
that I was very tired at the time, so all I could remember in the
morning about the event was that it was the next weekend, <span class="caps">NASA</span> was
involved and I really wanted to go. The reason I now believe deeply in
sleep procrastination is that it started me down a path of innovation
and free T-shirts that has culminated with me starting as an intern for
<span class="caps">NASA</span> in the Open Innovation&nbsp;Program.</p>
<p>That first Space Apps Challenge was a whirlwind experience. I had always
seen <span class="caps">NASA</span> as riding atop an ivory tower of scientific awesomeness;
disconnected from my life, but still really inspiring to me. I was
excited to be able to connect with <span class="caps">NASA</span>, as well as other organisations
doing similarly groundbreaking work, in a more direct way. The Oxford
venue (the International Space Innovation Centre, or <span class="caps">ISIC</span>) was truly
incredible, with monitor walls, 3D projectors and helpful people galore.
The collaborative atmosphere was palpable, and it took no time at all
for me to find some people to work with. After the initial meet and
greet, team finding etc business, I found myself working in a more
productive and creative way than I had in a long time and by the end of
the weekend I had helped to produce two solutions. The first was a
collection of cool real-time visualisations of data from space, the
second was a way to bake bread in space using limited resources. I’ll
probably talk more in depth about the stories of these solutions in a
future post. It was from this first Space Apps Challenge that I
initially formed a link with the awesome, all-knowing (and probably
reading this) people in the Open Innovation Program at <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<p>This link developed over the course of the year and a bit after the
first Space Apps Challenge, with the help of Nick Skytland, Chris Gerty,
Ali Llewellyn and others, into an even more direct connection to <span class="caps">NASA</span>:
starting as an intern there! It’s somewhat ironic that the focus of my
work with <span class="caps">NASA</span> is on how we can improve the way we run mass
collaboration events in the future, given that those very events are
what brought me to this position in the first place! So while I say that
I’m thankful for checking a blog at the opportune moment, I guess what I
am actually thankful for is the opportunity to work with the amazing
people at the Open Innovation&nbsp;Program.</p>
