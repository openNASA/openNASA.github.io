						<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Open Innovation Program recently participated in the <a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/">Open
Hardware Summit</a>, sponsored by the newly formed Open Source Hardware
Association (<a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/"><span class="caps">OSHWA</span></a>).  What we witnessed was a
community in its early stages, developing in front of our eyes, tackling
technical/legal/cultural challenges with an openness that we have grown
to respect and see as an essential part of the way <span class="caps">NASA</span> will do business
in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>There are so many interesting aspects of this growing community – from
the power that community platforms have in the design and manufacturing
of open hardware (<a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>, <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse</a>, and the newly launched
<a href="https://opendesignengine.net/">Open Design Engine</a>), to the striking desire of this community to
explore – encouraging kits like <a href="http://openrov.com/">OpenROV</a>, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space">CubeSat designs</a>, or
entire sets of projects like in <a href="http://makezine.com/24/">this space and science-themed issue</a>
of <a href="http://makezine.com/">Make: magazine</a>.</p>
<p>The event was truly a melting pot of the maker community.  Take for
instance the citizen scientists of <a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/home">Public Laboratory</a>. Their mission
is to foster a distributed community who specializes in using open
technology to investigate environmental concerns. Also represented in
force was the emerging open source driven 3D printer market. A variety
were on display, and even <a href="http://makerbot.com/">Makerbot</a>’s own Bre Pettis was on-hand to
give his thoughts on the new Replicator 2.  Of course the Maker
community would not be well represented without the namer (or namesake,
depending on who you ask) of the community itself. The <span class="caps">CEO</span> and founder
of <a href="http://makezine.com/">Make: Magazine</a>, Dale Dougherty, took us through the
history of the “Make:” brand, and reflected on his influencers along
that journey. Since this Maker community strives to re-teach <em>each
other</em> absolutely everything they learn, Dale’s choice to focus on
something that very few in the community already knew seemed perfect for
this&nbsp;venue.</p>
<p>After returning home and having time time to consider what I’ve learned,
two major takeaways resonate with me in the context of <span class="caps">NASA</span> and its&nbsp;future:</p>
<p><em>1.  Open source hardware is helping to make spaceflight accessible to
anyone,&nbsp;today.</em></p>
<p>Here I simply need to point to a stellar presentation by Stephen
Murphey, <a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/open-sourcing-the-final-frontier/">Open Sourcing the Final Frontier</a>.  During the presentation
he outlined the cubesat platform, and how (and for how much
out-of-pocket money) one can get involved.  Cubesats are designed to fit
in the extra pockets of space left by large, expensive payloads, and can
therefore be launched opportunistically when space is available.  To me,
this served as a practical, as well as a metaphorical example of how
small experimental projects within <span class="caps">NASA</span> have the potential to make a big
difference, and it also makes the philosophies of Open Government even
more relavant as we continue to explore with essential help from outside
the walls of&nbsp;government.</p>

<p><em>2.  For the most audacious of humanity’s goals, even for the ones where
large government-backed efforts will lead the way, open source
philosophies are critical for not only its success, but also its&nbsp;sustainability.</em></p>
<p>This was really more of an epiphany.  During the first session at the
#OHSummit, <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~leah/">Leah Buechley</a> (from <span class="caps">MIT</span>’s Media Lab) told a story about
how her friend’s power inverter, lacking an open hardware design, became
a barrier to self-repair when it failed, jeopardizing their family’s
solar-powered home.  Major hardware stores and paid repairmen were hard
to come by in their remote, “off-the-grid” outpost.  At that moment I
realised how much <span class="caps">NASA</span> had in common with the open source hardware
community. I spent a good portion of my career pondering how humanity
may someday venture beyond Low-Earth Orbit to live on other worlds.
 Leah’s story made a crystal-clear connection between our off-the-grid
efforts on Earth, and our dreams at <span class="caps">NASA</span> to do the same throughout the
solar&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>When humans leave Earth to live on other worlds, or even orbit Earth for
months at a time, the ability of a crew to repair, construct, make, and
tinker is just as important as designing robust, flexible, operable
hardware in the first place.  Replacement parts could take weeks or
months to get to the International Space Station, but imagine the
wait-time for a trip to Mars!!  Witnessing those around me in the room
nod their heads as they imagined their own solar power system, reminded
me that we at <span class="caps">NASA</span> are responsible for <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html">those living</a> in the most
“off-the-grid” home of them&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Attending the summit really helped reaffirm my belief that we&#8217;re all in
this space exploration thing together. Secondly, if there are lessons to
be learned by <strong>developing hardware in an open environment</strong> – and if
this in turn makes <strong>critical designs more sustainable</strong> – then yes,
open hardware community, we are listening&#8230;. <em>and we want to learn&nbsp;more!</em></p>
