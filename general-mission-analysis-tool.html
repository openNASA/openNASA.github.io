						<p>Late last month, the Goddard-led <span class="caps">GMAT</span> team unveiled the General Mission
Analysis Tool R2012a, the latest in a line of beta feature-development
releases that we’ve been putting out for the past five years. This is an
important milestone for the project: earlier this year our team switched
almost entirely to validation, documentation, and <span class="caps">QA</span> in preparation for
our first production-quality release, currently scheduled for early next
year. R2012a represents a feature-complete preview of that&nbsp;release.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://code.nasa.gov/project/general-mission-analysis-tool/">General Mission Analysis Tool</a> (<span class="caps">GMAT</span>) is a space trajectory
simulation, analysis, and optimization system developed by a team made
up of <span class="caps">NASA</span> Goddard Space Flight Center and private industry partners. It
is developed as open source under the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Source Agreement: not
only is the source code for each release available for download, but the
primary development repository is hosted publicly at
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/">SourceForge.net</a>. Here at <span class="caps">GSFC</span>, it’s been used as a primary or
secondary design tool on many of our most exciting missions: <span class="caps">LCROSS</span>,
<span class="caps">ARTEMIS</span>, <span class="caps">LRO</span>, <span class="caps">MMS</span>, <span class="caps">OSIRIS</span>, and others. And externally, it’s been used by
entities as varied as the Air Force Research Lab, Iowa State University,
and the European Space Agency. Contributors to this release included
<span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="caps">GSFC</span> civil servants, Thinking Systems Inc., and <span class="caps">A.I.</span>&nbsp;Solutions.</p>
<p>The R2012a release offers some exciting improvements from the last year
of&nbsp;development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ground track plot</strong>: <span class="caps">GMAT</span> can now show a two-dimensional ground
    track of your spacecraft on any planet or celestial body you&nbsp;choose.</li>
<li><strong>Orbit Designer</strong>:Now you can design an (Earth-centered) orbit as
    easily as choosing a type and a small set of defining parameters.
    For example, a geostationary orbit can now be created with just one&nbsp;click.</li>
<li><strong>Preview features</strong>: We’ve included previews of an eclipse locator
    feature, which can detect when a spacecraft will enter and exit
    shadow regions, and of a C-language interface to <span class="caps">GMAT</span>’s modeling&nbsp;features.</li>
<li><strong>Many others</strong>: This version of <span class="caps">GMAT</span> includes many smaller
    improvements to its modeling capabilities, performance, and&nbsp;usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, this is the last of the feature-driven beta versions
that we’ve been releasing since 2007. As of this spring, we’ve switched
almost entirely to quality improvement. We’re making a full sweep
through the system, going feature-by-feature and making sure everything
is spec’d, tested, and documented, all leading to our first production
release this winter. The coming year is going to be an important one for
the project: the production version will open the doors for
collaboration and public engagement far beyond their current levels, and
we’re working hard to get ourselves into a position to take advantage of
that. Look for many changes to <span class="caps">GMAT</span>’s public-facing infrastructure and
community development efforts in the coming&nbsp;months.</p>
<p>We need your help to make <span class="caps">GMAT</span> a success: please subscribe to our <a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmat-betatest">beta
testing mailing list</a> if you are interested in participating. Or, as
always, join us at our <a href="http://gmat.ed-pages.com/forum/">forums</a>, <a href="http://gmat.sf.net/blog">blog</a>, or <a href="http://gmat.ed-pages.com/wiki">wiki</a>.</p>
