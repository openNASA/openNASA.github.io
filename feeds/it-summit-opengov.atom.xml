Strategy&lt;/a&gt; to the Office of Management and Budget. The 6 month
milestones for our &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/06/20/the-roadmap-for-digital-government/"&gt;Digital Strategy&lt;/a&gt; are the 2nd update we&amp;#8217;ve made to
the plan, following our 3 month milestones that we launched in August.
There are a number of new things that we&amp;#8217;re super excited to&amp;nbsp;share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Digital Services Governance Framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Digital Strategy is cross-cutting and involves dozens of leads and
potentially hundreds of potential participants from across the agency.
As a result, as we work towards implementing many of the goals of the
strategy, its imperative that we also look at how we manage our overall
direction and focus to ensure that the right people are getting involved
and that we&amp;#8217;re working efficiently&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Governance Strategy, the majority of which was written by the
awesome Sarah Rigdon in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Web Services office, plans to help us
focus our efforts by establishing the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Clearly Defined Scope of&amp;nbsp;Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Principals to Guide&amp;nbsp;Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Established Roles and&amp;nbsp;Responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Target&amp;nbsp;State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more of the governance strategy at
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Agency-wide Inventory of Mobile Devices and Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html#5-1"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We also developing an inventory of mobile devices and contracts at the
agency which we expect to deliver to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMB&lt;/span&gt; shortly. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees use
thousands of mobile devices, from smartphones to mobile hotspots to
pagers (yes, pagers - they still have some use in specialized
situations!), to stay connected to their work around the globe. We&amp;#8217;re in
the midst of a major transition to a new service provider under the
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/dec/HQ_C10-080_ACES.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACES&lt;/span&gt; contract&lt;/a&gt;, which has given the agency a great opportunity to
look closer at the mobile services we offer to employees and make them
even&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt; group at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has focused on our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYOD&lt;/span&gt; (Bring Your
Own Device) policy as a major way to empower employees to stay connected
to their work. As part of this, we&amp;#8217;ve realized that mobile interfaces
and responsive design are more important than ever in ensuring the
services &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; offers both internally and to the public are accessible,
usable, and&amp;nbsp;extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, our Digital Strategy is available in a number of formats,
including &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s also
available to the public via &lt;a href="http://www.github.com/nasa/digital-strategy"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you&amp;#8217;re excited as we are with the progress we&amp;#8217;re making on
implementing a Digital Strategy for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. As always, if you have
comments, questions, or feedback for us, please leave us a comment -
we&amp;#8217;d love to hear from&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="digital strategy"></category><category term="mobile"></category><category term="responsive design"></category></entry><entry><title>We want your thoughts on “Connected: An Autoblogography”!</title><link href="/we-want-your-thoughts-on-connected-an-autoblogography" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-16T22:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sean Herron</name></author><id>tag:,2011-08-16:we-want-your-thoughts-on-connected-an-autoblogography</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Earlier tonight, we hosted an advanced screening of the acclaimed
Sundance documentary &lt;a href="http://connectedthefilm.com/"&gt;Connected: An Autoblogography about Love, Death &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
Technology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsummit/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Summit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;em&gt;Connected&lt;/em&gt;“, &lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Shlain&lt;/strong&gt;, award-winning filmmaker and
founder of The Webby Awards, traces interdependence througha history,
discovering surprising links between right brain and left; honey bees
and stress; hormones and happiness; technology and nature; progress and
consequences; and parents and children. The result: a personal film with
universal&amp;nbsp;resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liked the film, you can also see Tiffany speak at tomorrow&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://tedxnasa.com/silicon-valley/speakers/"&gt;TEDxNASA@SiliconValley&lt;/a&gt;, which will also be streamed online &lt;a href="http://tedxnasa.com/silicon-valley/live-stream/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the trailer&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to know how &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; enjoyed the film and what &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; thoughts
are on how it relates to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s continually growing exploration of
collaborative technologies. We&amp;#8217;d love to have a discussion in our
comments on this topic and other ideas from the themes seen in the film.
Some potential areas for&amp;nbsp;discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does collaboration at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mirror the idea of connectedness
    shown in the film? Can our ten centers be seen as the trees in the
    forest with a common system of&amp;nbsp;roots?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a large emphasis in the film on the impact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has had on
    both the filmmaker and the world. What ability does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; have to
    influence collaboration and inspiration on others? How can we, as an
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; organization, contribute to&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you as an individual feel you fit in with the bigger mission
    of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;? How do you see yourself as critical to our&amp;nbsp;success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps most importantly: did you like the film? What thoughts do
    you have on the creator&amp;#8217;s life adventure and her way of illustrating
    it to the viewer? Would you like to see more of these types of
    screenings at future &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;events?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

We look forward to talking with you about the film and hearing your
thoughts, ideas, and feedback! Use the comment fields below to discuss
(note that all comments are moderated - we will work to review and
approve comments as quickly as possible).
