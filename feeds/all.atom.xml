company which aims to &amp;#8220;expand Earth&amp;#8217;s natural resource base&amp;#8221; by
developing (and eventually using) the technology to mine asteroids in
the Solar System. They also have a lot of money, with investors such as
Larry Page (Co-founder of Google) and James Cameron (Writer of Rambo:
First Blood Part &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;). But what if they’re thinking a bit too small?
There’s an exoplanet called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/55_Cancri_e" title="55 Cancri e"&gt;55 Cancri e&lt;/a&gt; which orbits the star 55
Cancri A \~41 light-years away from Earth. What makes 55 Cancri e
interesting is that it weighs about 8.63 times the mass of the Earth and
there is a good chance that &lt;a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...759L..40M" title="Diamond Planet!"&gt;about third of that mass is diamond&lt;/a&gt;.
That’s a lot of diamond. Let’s be optimistic and assume for the moment
that 55 Cancri e does in fact contain 2.88 times the mass of the Earth
on diamond. What would happen if Planetary Resources really turned on
the afterburner and tried to mine 55 Cancri&amp;nbsp;e?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One slight problem is that at the moment very little is known about the
geochemistry/geophysics of carbon-rich planets like 55 Cancri e (Earth
is “oxygen-rich”), though I’m sure the promise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INFINITY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIAMOND&lt;/span&gt; would
make the necessary research happen. Let’s just assume that the mining
professionals can figure out how to mine diamond from 55 Cancri e anyway
(probably with lasers or something). The problem then becomes transport.
41 light-years doesn’t sound too bad, does it? &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1" title="Voyager 1"&gt;Voyager 1&lt;/a&gt;, which
recently left our Solar System, is 18,812,796,028 km away from Earth and
is going really quite fast (\~17km per second relative to the Sun).
While it is one of humanity’s crowning achievements in space
exploration, Voyager 1 is only 0.00198 light-years from Earth (and that
took 36 years!). It would therefore take 20707 years for a spacecraft
travelling at the same speed as Voyager 1 to get to 55 Cancri e from
Earth. Even &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helios_2_(NASA)" title="Helios 2"&gt;Helios 2&lt;/a&gt;, a West German/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; probe which currently holds
the record for the highest speed attained by a man-made object, 67km per
second, would still take 5254 years at it’s max speed to reach 55 Cancri
e. It should also be noted that while Voyager 1 and Helios 2 are
reasonably heavy, the equipment required for a substantial mining
program would be orders of magnitude&amp;nbsp;heavier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that conventional propulsion technologies currently
available to us just don’t cut it. But there’s another problem. Even if
we can develop the technology fast enough to get there within a few
decades (i.e. figure out how to travel close to the speed of light), we
develop an arch-nemesis: Hydrogen gas. Why? Well, there’s the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_medium" title="Interstellar Medium"&gt;extremely
low density cloud of hydrogen in Interstellar space&lt;/a&gt; that we would
need to travel through. The issue is that when you travel at near the
speed of light, that thin cloud of hydrogen is essentially turned into a
death ray. According to &lt;a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn18532-starship-pilots-speed-kills-especially-warp-speed.html#.UkMXWmQ9znU" title="New Scientist Article"&gt;William Edelstein&lt;/a&gt; of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine in Baltimore, if a spacecraft were to
travel at 99.999998 percent the speed of light, the hydrogen atoms would
seem to have an energy of 7 Teraelectronvolts, the same energy as
protons in the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider" title="LHC"&gt;Large Hadron Collider at Cern running at full tilt&lt;/a&gt;.
This would expose the crew to over 10000 sieverts of radiation every
second, given that the lethal dose of radiation for a human is 8
sieverts, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Bugorski" title="Guy who got hit in the face by a particle accelerator beam"&gt;you’re going to have a bad time&lt;/a&gt;. Even a robotic mining
crew would struggle, the electronics would be very quickly fried and the
structure of the ship would disintegrate well before the ship arrived at
55 Cancri&amp;nbsp;e.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s an obvious solution to the death ray problem, we’re going to
&lt;a href="http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/27500/1012816-warpchrt.gif" title="Warp Factors"&gt;have to go faster than light&lt;/a&gt;! There are two options for this, both
of which are highly theoretical at the moment. I’m not going to go into
too much detail, because there’s a lot of complex physics/maths and not
a whole lot of consensus. The first method involves creating a
“&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole#Traversable_wormholes" title="Traversable Wormhole"&gt;Traversable Wormhole&lt;/a&gt;” (essentially a gate between two locations)
between somewhere near Earth and somewhere near 55 Cancri e. Since you
can travel at fairly vanilla speeds through the wormhole, Hydrogen
death-rays aren’t a problem, but you can still travel somewhere far away
very quickly. The second method uses something called an “&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive" title="Alcubierre Drive"&gt;Alcubierre
Drive&lt;/a&gt;” which distorts space-time around you in order to get to a
location faster than light travelling in normal, garden-variety
spacetime. While it is somewhat mathematically consistent with current
physical theories, it requires weird things like Negative Energy
Density, so might not be feasible to build one! Because of these
considerations, I’m going to say that a Traversable Wormhole will be our
best bet. These will enable us to get to 55 Cancri e extremely quickly
(\&amp;lt;41&amp;nbsp;years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be prudent to open up the wormhole portal thing reasonable far
away from Earth, we’ll use 35,786km because that’s the same height as a
Geosynchronous orbit and I can calculate how much it costs to to get our
mining equipment up there! Using the &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/falcon-heavy" title="Falcon Heavy"&gt;SpaceX Falcon Heavy&lt;/a&gt; launch
system, currently the world’s most powerful rocket, it costs [\$130
million][] to get 21.2 tonnes up to that altitude. I don’t know much
about mining equipment, so I just found &lt;a href="http://xml.catmms.com/servlet/ImageServlet?imageId=C775593" title="Expensive Drill"&gt;the most expensive looking
Drill I could&lt;/a&gt;. I know it probably won’t be the right kind of thing,
but I’m going to use it’s mass as a benchmark for the weight for the
fancy laser-using robotic miners we’re going to deploy to 55 Cancri e.
Fortunately, the expensive looking drill weighs 20.4 tonnes, so we’ll
say each Robo-Miner thing costs \$130 million to get to 55 Cancri e
(assuming the wormhole was already there or something). We’re also going
to want to bring some transportation equipment to send the diamonds back
to Earth! Since there likely aren’t any people on 55 Cancri e, we can
probably put one of the wormhole entrances on the surface of 55 Cancri e
(and figure out some way to slow down our equipment when it passes
through the wormhole from Geostationary Transfer orbit). I’m going to
use the specs of the &lt;a href="http://www.spacex.com/dragon" title="SpaceX Dragon"&gt;SpaceX Dragon&lt;/a&gt; as a benchmark for what the
specifications of our diamond return vehicle will be like (we’d need a
souped up heatshield though!). A SpaceX dragon weighs 4.2 tonnes and can
return to Earth with 3.13 tonnes of extra cargo, so if we use some fancy
folding system we can assume that we can launch 5 diamond return
vehicles on one SpaceX Falcon Heavy. Since R&amp;amp;D/Construction/Running
costs are notoriously hard to estimate, let’s assume that the cost will
be in the same order of magnitude as the Apollo program (I’ve excluded
the cost of the launch vehicles, because we’re going to get them from
SpaceX): \$15.2 billion. I’m going to sum up our costs&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Startup Costs:&lt;/span&gt; 20
Robo-Miners x \$130 million each for launch = \$2.6 billion. Total
Estimated Costs = \$2.6 billion + \$15.2 billion = &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\$17.8 billion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
(This does not take into account the cost of the Diamond Return Vehicle&amp;nbsp;launches).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Cost of each Diamond Return
Vehicle:&lt;/span&gt; \$130 million for each launch/5 Vehicles = &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\$26
million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Current estimated price of 1
Tonne of Diamond:&lt;/span&gt; [\$60 million for 0.01192 kilograms][].
Therefore 1 Tonne of Diamond is currently worth &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\$83892 million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Cost to return 1 Tonne of
Diamond:&lt;/span&gt; Each Diamond Return Vehicle costs \$26 million and can
return 3.13 Tonnes of Diamond. Therefore 1 Tonne costs &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\$8.3&amp;nbsp;million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Profit on each Tonne of
Diamond:&lt;/span&gt; \$83892 million - \$8.2 million = &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;\~\$84.9&amp;nbsp;billion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the above, this would be very profitable! Keep in
mind the effect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INFINITY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIAMOND&lt;/span&gt; would have on the price of diamond
(&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand" title="How does it work?"&gt;Economists&lt;/a&gt;, help me out!) It would give the miners of 55 Cancri e
essentially a monopoly in the diamond industry though, and each capsule
returning to Earth would make \~\$265.7 billion in profit with the
diamond prices of today! This would likely make the extremely high R&amp;amp;D
costs much easier to&amp;nbsp;stomach!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Awesome Stuff in Space</title><link href="/awesome-stuff-in-space" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-06T09:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sam Wilkinson</name></author><id>tag:,2013-09-06:awesome-stuff-in-space</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of man-made objects in space that almost everyone
will know about: the International Space Station, the Hubble Space
Telescope, Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity and maybe Voyager I and/or
 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt;. However, there is so much other man-made stuff in space it’s crazy
(and it’s actually starting to become a &lt;a href="http://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/protect/impacts.html" title="Space Debris is a BIG problem"&gt;problem&lt;/a&gt;). This abundance of
space-faring objects can make it hard for some truly awesome
experiments, missions etc to get much exposure! I’d like to fix that
with a recurring blog post series called “Awesome Stuff in Space”. Since
this is the inaugural post, I’m going to cover two of the coolest
lesser-known things currently in space (in my humble opinion), as well
as an awesome example of recycling (which is no longer in&amp;nbsp;space).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. &lt;a href="http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/satellite_missions/current_missions/lag1_general.html" title="LAGEOS"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAGEOS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The (really useful) orbital disco&amp;nbsp;ball&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked what the most precise method currently available for
determining the position of a place on earth was, my first response
would probably be military-grade &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt;, but I’d be wrong. In fact, the
most precise way to determine your position on earth is by bouncing a
laser beam off of what is essentially a disco ball in space. That disco
ball would either be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAGEOS&lt;/span&gt;-1 or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAGEOS&lt;/span&gt;-2 (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;ser
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;dynamics&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;atellite), &lt;a href="http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/lageosII.jpg" title="LAGEOS picture"&gt;two 60cm wide spheres&lt;/a&gt; each
covered in 426 retroreflectors (a special mirror that reflects light
back the way it came) currently orbiting the earth at &lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/Orbitalaltitudes.jpg" title="Orbital height reference"&gt;5,900km above
us&lt;/a&gt;. By measuring the time taken for a laser pulse to travel to a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAGEOS&lt;/span&gt; satellite and back, the distance between the ground station and
the satellite can be calculated to a very high degree of accuracy (\~1
inch for thousands of miles). Since the orbits of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAGEOS&lt;/span&gt; satellites
are very stable, their positions can be determined to a high degree of
accuracy. This coupled with the distance between the ground station and
the satellite can be used to determine the precise location of the
ground station. There are ground stations performing these measurements
in many countries, and the results are used to study tectonic plate
movement by groups from around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. &lt;a href="http://dawn.jpl.nasa.gov/" title="Dawn"&gt;Dawn&lt;/a&gt;: Exploring new frontiers in new&amp;nbsp;ways&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favourite statistics on the solar system is this:
approximately 42% of the mass of the asteroid belt is made up from just
two objects, the dwarf planet &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_(dwarf_planet)" title="Ceres"&gt;Ceres&lt;/a&gt; and the asteroid &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4_Vesta" title="Vesta"&gt;Vesta&lt;/a&gt;.
These also happen to be the two main objectives for the spacecraft Dawn,
launched in September of 2007. Dawn has already travelled to Vesta, and
is currently en route to Ceres. The study of Ceres and Vesta will
greatly contribute to our understanding of the formation of planets.
Since Ceres and Vesta are the two largest remaining
protoplanets (planetary embryos) in the solar system, the observation of
these objects will give us a peek at the earliest stages in the
formation of the solar system. What makes Dawn even more special, aside
from it being the first craft to travel to both Vesta and Ceres
(hopefully), is that it is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s first purely exploratory mission to
use &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion_thruster" title="Ion Thrusters"&gt;ion thrusters&lt;/a&gt; as its sole mode of&amp;nbsp;propulsion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_8895&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;540&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="Vesta

Hubble and Dawn (guess which&amp;#8230;)&lt;/a&gt; Vesta as seen from Hubble (left) and
Dawn&amp;nbsp;(right)[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​3. &lt;a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat-new/articles/BauerSuitsat/" title="SuitSat-1"&gt;SuitSat-1&lt;/a&gt;: “A Russian&amp;nbsp;Brainstorm”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept behind SuitSat-1 is quite simple, put some simple
electronics (radio communications system, telemetry) into a Russian
Orlan spacesuit, then throw it out of the airlock. According to Frank
Bauer of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Goddard Space Flight Center, “SuitSat is a Russian
brainstorm, some of our Russian partners in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; program &amp;#8230; had an
idea: Maybe we can turn old spacesuits into useful satellites.&amp;#8221; Aside
from broadcasting voice messages from students around the world, and
some telemetry data, SuitSat-1 also looked really eerie. Images of
Suit-Sat as it was being jettisoned from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; are kind of&amp;nbsp;haunting&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

the software used to power the 2013 &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;*, a global hackathon focusing on space technology and
issues. 39A is an online collaboration platform designed to help your
community take ‘giant leaps’ forward in addressing your challenges and
meeting your mission goals. It is easily customizable with your own
graphics and branding and the platform is intended to be an
inspirational launch pad for your&amp;nbsp;collaborations!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed this open innovation platform to enable collaborative
problem solving around a shared challenge. Our goal was to directly
involve and empower citizens in our exploration mission, evolve
government to be more efficient and effective by creating a vehicle for
open innovation and worldwide participation, and accelerate the
development of innovative new&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software is customized for management of global mass collaborations
or large-scale hackathons like the International Space Apps Challenge.
It can be used for multiple events, it will scale to include hundreds of
locations and thousands of participants, it&amp;#8217;s flexible enough to create
challenge pages supported with data and other resources, and most
importantly, it seamlessly supports a truly global collaboration between
participants in physical locations as well as those participating&amp;nbsp;virtually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;39A is released under an Apache 2.0 license and built on top of Django,
a high-level Python Web framework. The theme is a clean, responsive
design and takes advantage of modern web standards. A summary of the
major features is included below. You can download the software

39A, and the entire International Space Apps Challenge, was a labor of
love by so many.  These few thousand lines of code were greatly
influenced by the entire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Innovation Program team especially
the project manager Ali Llewellyn, and the heavily lifting was performed
by the amazing Sean Herron and William&amp;nbsp;Eshagh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* On 20-21 April 2013, over 9,000 people around the world participated
in one of the galaxy&amp;#8217;s largest mass collaborations ever - the
International Space Apps Challenge. To learn more about the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; isn&amp;#8217;t just sending rovers to Mars and astronauts to the
International Space Station. Find out how the space agency is studying
our home planet and why it&amp;#8217;s working to make the Earth science data it
collects understandable and meaningful to the public, policy makers and
media. See where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s 16 Earth-orbiting satellites are right now, and
learn how their data can be viewed on your phone, often within hours of
being collected. Hear from communicators and designers working with
climate change scientists to put a planet&amp;#8217;s worth of information in your
hand via mobile apps, interactive websites, near real-time
visualizations, and social media. Plus, get a sneak peek at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Earth-observing missions launching in 2014-2015. Earth is changing.
We&amp;#8217;re on&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sx(NxEx)&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SW&lt;/span&gt;: A Manifesto for
Global Collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/23711"&gt;http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/23711&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating change is at the heart of our technology community. Citizens,
software developers, and entrepreneurs from all over the world are
collaboratively creating, building and inventing new solutions using
publicly-released data, code and technology to solve challenges relevant
to our neighborhoods, our cities and our countries. We are excited to
tell the story of how you inspire people to work together across the
globe and across disciplines on a shared vision that emerges out of the
making culture. With experience leading some of the world&amp;#8217;s largest
hackathons, and diverse local events in music, science and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEAM&lt;/span&gt;, we
will show how you can make a collaboration work on a practical level but
more importantly how learning can be acted on locally after the events
over by keeping the community engaged over the long&amp;nbsp;term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live From Space!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember when the public had to watch Walter Cronkite and the evening
news to learn what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was doing? Yeah, neither do we. Today, using
technology you can connect and collaborate with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and astronauts
directly from&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this session, we&amp;#8217;ll connect live with astronauts flying 240 miles
above the Earth at 17,500 mph. Ask about their mission and using
technology to communicate with us down here on the&amp;nbsp;ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you&amp;#8217;ll discover how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has fundamentally changed the way
it communicates with the public and how you can join the community of
space geeks from around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s Not Rocket Science: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UX&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;User experience design typically focuses on creating meaningful
experiences that will affect as many people as possible. Startups covet
reaching critical mass; success for larger companies is often measured
in tens of millions, and designs are created accordingly. But what if
your system is only for five users? What if you had to support a complex
and mature process that, if captured incorrectly, could lead to
astronomical disaster? Welcome to the world of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UX&lt;/span&gt; design for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
safety communities. In this talk, we&amp;#8217;ll give you a look into the design
team working on support tools for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; and future exploration
missions. The problem space may be space problems, but that doesn’t mean
the difficulties encountered are alien. In this session, we&amp;#8217;ll discuss
how working at a small scale affects research, testing, analytics, and
design. We&amp;#8217;ll show how human-centered design practices impact our
everyday work and how personal communication can save or destroy a
project of any&amp;nbsp;size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you a) are alive and b) have a job, it&amp;#8217;s likely that you have or will
find yourself working in or dealing with a bureaucracy. Oh, the joys of
being an adult! It is said that an efficient bureaucracy is the greatest
threat to liberty that we know. It is increasingly clear that the fate
of the universe will come to depend more and more on individuals like
you - slayers of bureaucracy - as the this dark force slowly permeates
every corner of our existence. We have no other choice but to do
something about it. This session will not only provide you with a
survival guide to keep yourself alive when beadledom is near but it will
also equip you with a strategic plan to cut through the red tape and
slay the ugliest of&amp;nbsp;dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future of all humanity and the end of the world is at stake. We need
your&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Hack Hacking: Make

&lt;p&gt;Hackathons are getting out of control. However, this flood of 48 hour
frantic coding sessions are spawning national and global collaborations
resulting in not just new apps and projects (and a job opportunity in
the case of one of the speakers) but also lasting social&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ freespace ] was able to obtain a lease for a 14,000 sq ft building for
\$1 for the month of June, and showed the possibility of civic
improvement and community-building when people have a space to come
together in and share, collaborate, and&amp;nbsp;create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this deluge of short, international shots of weekend
collaboration, desired social change needs a lot of time and the
inclusion of a cross section of planetary shareholders to occur. The [
freespace ] model of collaboration uses the power that the community
holds to transform a neighbourhood by activating empty space. Hear from
our panelists on how the [ freespace ] is helping to revolutionise
collaboration as we know&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanging Out on Google+ with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has allowed you to get a unique
perspective on America&amp;#8217;s space agency. In this session, we&amp;#8217;ll explore
how Google+ Hangouts on Air have embedded the taxpaying public into
mission operations, breathtaking scientific discoveries, and agency
events like never before. From Hangouts on Air with Astronauts on the
International Space Station to preparations for flying a scientific
aircraft through a hurricane, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s use of Google+ Hangouts on Air have
brought out of the world experiences to large audiences. We&amp;#8217;ll take a
look at the keys to our success and the challenges we faced along the
way. So come, hangout with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The James Webb Space Telescope is the world’s most ambitious scientific
experiment. It is the successor to the iconic Hubble Space Telescope,
and will be 100x more powerful. The Webb Telescope, taller than a
four-story building, is designed to answer some of the most puzzling
scientific questions that humankind faces today. &amp;#8220;How did the Universe
form?&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;Is our Solar System unique?&amp;#8221;, and &amp;#8220;Are we alone?&amp;#8221; Webb will
answer these questions, and many more, by taking the deepest and
clearest pictures of the cosmos to date. But &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JWST&lt;/span&gt; is not alone. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JWST&lt;/span&gt;
discoveries will rely on the findings of precursor telescopes like
Kepler, which has already discovered dozens of Earth-size planets, or
the upcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WFIRST&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TESS&lt;/span&gt; missions. Our panel will examine the
important contributions these telescopes will make in the search for
life in the Universe, and set the stage for how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JWST&lt;/span&gt; could find the
first signs of life on another&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Returning from a decade of war, emerging military leaders had been
required to innovate their way through countless cross-cultural
interactions while deployed overseas. Stateside life has proved
otherwise, as bureaucratic realities crush combat-tested,
entrepreneurial minded officers. Recognizing this, junior officers have
self-assembled to create ad hoc, informal advocacy organizations within
the military to promote outside-the-box solutions. Groups such as
Disruptive Thinkers and the Defense Entrepreneurs Forum have galvanized
lumbering military institutions to look to Start Up culture in
motivating the Millennial&amp;nbsp;Generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel will explore the challenges faced and lessons learned by
junior officers and enlisted personnel pushing Information Age solutions
through an Industrial Age hierarchy. Their stories of being both
entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs will give valuable lessons to those
desiring to navigate and innovate within large, established&amp;nbsp;organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Next-Generation

&lt;p&gt;People imagine space software to be sleek and modern. But the tools &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
use today look nothing like their Star Trek counterparts. Instead,
they&amp;#8217;re text-based, neon-colored, and complicated with age. This is a
shame, but it&amp;#8217;s also an opportunity. We&amp;#8217;re a small design team within
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, working to break this trend. We want the interfaces astronauts,
scientists, and astronomers interact with to be just as cool as we all
dream them to be. We&amp;#8217;ve redesigned systems for the Mars Curiosity Rover,
the Kepler Space Telescope, and the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust
Environment Explorer. Join us in this session to see some of this work,
and to learn how we&amp;#8217;re pushing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; forward to the touch and gesture
based&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are We Smarter than the

&lt;p&gt;66 million years ago, the dinosaurs had a very, very bad day thanks to
an asteroid at least 10 km wide. Since 1998, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has led the global
effort to find potentially hazardous asteroids, and has successfully
found 95 percent of the near-Earth asteroids larger than 1km within the
last 15 years. But the work is not over, and it will take a global
effort with innovative solutions through participatory engagement to
complete the survey of smaller, but still potentially hazardous
asteroids. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Grand Challenge to “find all asteroid threats to human
populations and know what to do about them” will employ open innovation
tactics “on steroids”. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a rich history of using prizes and
crowdsourcing to engage more than the usual suspects in solving hard
problems. This session will explore how a “new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;” and open innovation
can meaningfully engage people in space, provide funding opportunities
to developers, makers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; entrepreneurs, and help us solve problems of
global&amp;nbsp;importance.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>A 48-Hour Career: Space Apps By Numbers</title><link href="/a-48-hour-career-space-apps-by-numbers" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-08-06T14:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sam Wilkinson</name></author><id>tag:,2013-08-06:a-48-hour-career-space-apps-by-numbers</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When the International Space Apps Challenge wrapped up on the evening of
April 21th 2013 in Maui, it had become the largest hackathon in the
galaxy. After the event, Space Apps 2013 was seen the world over as a
resounding success; bringing together thousands of people from all over
the world to solve problems relevant to not just the mission of space
exploration, but also problems facing us here on earth. Put simply, it
was awesome. But exactly how big was Space Apps 2013? What precisely
made Space Apps as awesome as it was? It is these very questions that
will be answered in this, the inaugural edition of Space Apps By
Numbers! *Everyone&amp;nbsp;Cheers*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s build out the numerical foundations of Space Apps before we
delve into the statistical interior decorating that will hopefully
inform your decision on how awesome Space Apps was. During the event,
9147 registered participants collaborated across 83 event locations, as
well as virtually, in 44 different countries. These participants
produced 770 unique solutions to over 58 challenges curated by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and
20 other agencies/organizations [1]. This data is awesome, but you all
have probably heard it all before, plus it’s not portrayed in a way that
is particularly relevant to most people. For example after a certain
point, a given number of people just becomes “a lot of&amp;nbsp;people”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a few ways to think about how much work was done over the course
of the weekend which could be relevant to most people: The number of
man-hours contributed over the weekend of Space Apps 2013 was equivalent
to a single person working for 33 years of their life [2]. The solutions
produced have an a very conservatively estimated total value of \$4.6
million; if Space Apps was a startup it would be doing very well! In
fact, Space Apps wouldn’t just be successful in terms of capital, but
also productivity; roughly 15 times more mobile apps were developed over
the course of the Space Apps weekend than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; itself has ever published&amp;nbsp;[3].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, not many of the awesomely fun statistics I just shared
with you (you’re welcome) are space-related. I mean come on, we’re
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;!!! Let’s make our statistics relevant to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;! If we assume that
all of the people who participated in Space Apps were working on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
projects, and therefore think of them as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees, then Space Apps
increased &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s workforce by 50.1% (but just for the weekend) [4].  At
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we unequivocally support all of our astronauts. That’s why we like
this statistic: There were enough volunteer hours during Space Apps to
construct two brand new spacesuits from scratch, for the two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
astronauts currently in orbit, and to build new houses for the rest of
the active duty &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; astronauts still on earth&amp;nbsp;[5].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, on the 44th anniversary of humanity&amp;#8217;s first steps on the Moon and
the 3rd anniversary of the birth of &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/"&gt;Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt; as a platform for
collaboration we are thrilled to announce that three Fragile Oasis
community projects have earned the Fragile Oasis Prize Medal for making
a positive impact in Education, Humanitarian Service and&amp;nbsp;Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 120 projects submitted from all over the world, Fragile Oasis
crewmembers selected &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/blog/2013/07/making-an-impact-the-fragile-oasis-prize-medal-nominees/"&gt;nine semi-finalists&lt;/a&gt; making a difference in
Argentina, Canada, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and in the United States. And
then, over a 30-day period, crewmembers voted for one project in each
category to receive a medal that flew with me for a half year on my last
mission to the International Space&amp;nbsp;Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners of the Fragile Oasis Prize Medal&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;

amazing (now former) school and the supportive, kind group of friends I
am so fortunate to have, to name just a few. There is another item on my
list of thankfulness which would surprise most people. Before I
enlighten you as to what the mystery list item is, I’ll set the scene
and give some background on me. I’ve just finished high school in the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, and I’m a massive fan of Science and Maths as well as most Sci-Fi
and the Toronto Maple Leafs. Also, I’m Canadian-American, but usually
identify as Canadian (because Canadians are better at hockey). Anyway,
that mystery item from earlier is a 16 year old me tiredly checking the
Make Magazine blog late at night in 2011 and reading an article about
the first International Space Apps Challenge. Now I should emphasise
that I was very tired at the time, so all I could remember in the
morning about the event was that it was the next weekend, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was
involved and I really wanted to go. The reason I now believe deeply in
sleep procrastination is that it started me down a path of innovation
and free T-shirts that has culminated with me starting as an intern for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in the Open Innovation&amp;nbsp;Program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That first Space Apps Challenge was a whirlwind experience. I had always
seen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as riding atop an ivory tower of scientific awesomeness;
disconnected from my life, but still really inspiring to me. I was
excited to be able to connect with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, as well as other organisations
doing similarly groundbreaking work, in a more direct way. The Oxford
venue (the International Space Innovation Centre, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISIC&lt;/span&gt;) was truly
incredible, with monitor walls, 3D projectors and helpful people galore.
The collaborative atmosphere was palpable, and it took no time at all
for me to find some people to work with. After the initial meet and
greet, team finding etc business, I found myself working in a more
productive and creative way than I had in a long time and by the end of
the weekend I had helped to produce two solutions. The first was a
collection of cool real-time visualisations of data from space, the
second was a way to bake bread in space using limited resources. I’ll
probably talk more in depth about the stories of these solutions in a
future post. It was from this first Space Apps Challenge that I
initially formed a link with the awesome, all-knowing (and probably
reading this) people in the Open Innovation Program at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This link developed over the course of the year and a bit after the
first Space Apps Challenge, with the help of Nick Skytland, Chris Gerty,
Ali Llewellyn and others, into an even more direct connection to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;:
starting as an intern there! It’s somewhat ironic that the focus of my
work with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is on how we can improve the way we run mass
collaboration events in the future, given that those very events are
what brought me to this position in the first place! So while I say that
I’m thankful for checking a blog at the opportune moment, I guess what I
am actually thankful for is the opportunity to work with the amazing
people at the Open Innovation&amp;nbsp;Program.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>NASA Asteroid Initiative</title><link href="/nasa-asteroid-initiative" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-20T15:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-20:nasa-asteroid-initiative</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, June 18, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; proudly &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5rsJwsyni4"&gt;announced a Grand Challenge&lt;/a&gt; “to
find all asteroid threats to human populations and know what to do about
them” at the Asteroid Initiative Industry and Partner Day in Washington,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;. The goals of the day were to (1) provide more detail about the
Asteroid Redirect Mission planning to find, capture, and redirect a 7-10
meter asteroid into a translunar orbit so astronauts can explore it and
bring back samples to Earth, (2) announce the Grand Challenge a brand
new effort and new way for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to do business, and (3) release a
Request for Information (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt;) to solicit ideas and concepts that could
support both. The Asteroid Initiative proposed in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FY14&lt;/span&gt; President&amp;#8217;s
budget for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; includes two synergistic components: the Asteroid
Redirect Mission and the Grand&amp;nbsp;Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The essence of this stage of the Grand Challenge is to begin to engage
in a broad conversation with traditional and non-traditional partners to
collaboratively design an implementation plan to manage the many
pathways to address this Challenge. While there is no imminent danger
from a hazardous asteroid and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has led a global effort resulting in
discovery of 95 percent of the potentially devastating 1 km wide
near-Earth asteroids, more needs to be done. Asteroid impacts and
explosions from objects much smaller than 1 km, like the one over Russia
in February, have the capability of rendering massive devastation and
most of the objects of that size are&amp;nbsp;undiscovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to accelerate and enhance the existing global effort, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has
issued this Call to Action to expand the conversations about ways to
work more collaboratively on science, technology development and threat
mitigation for the Grand Challenge. Recognizing the power of traditional
and innovative collaboration – including the use of public private
partnerships, citizen science, crowdsourcing, and incentive prizes, in
addition to international and other cooperative partnerships – &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will
lead a dialogue addressing how to best use these methods to aid in
solving this global problem,&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So how can you get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has issued &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/asteroids/initiative/asteroid-rfi.html"&gt;this Request for Information&lt;/a&gt; to gather ideas and
concepts on how best to engage the community and develop solutions for
the Asteroid Initiative, which includes both the Grand Challenge and the
Asteroid Redirect Mission. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt; is open to all organizations and
individuals, and submissions are due July 18. To help address questions
from potential respondents, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; technical experts will host a Google+
Hangout on June 27. You can send &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt;-related questions
to &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#104;&amp;#113;&amp;#45;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#45;&amp;#114;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#97;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;"&gt;&amp;#104;&amp;#113;&amp;#45;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#114;&amp;#111;&amp;#105;&amp;#100;&amp;#45;&amp;#114;&amp;#102;&amp;#105;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#46;&amp;#110;&amp;#97;&amp;#115;&amp;#97;&amp;#46;&amp;#103;&amp;#111;&amp;#118;&lt;/a&gt; in advance and during the Google+&amp;nbsp;Hangout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt; is just the first of multiple engagement opportunitiesfor the
Grand Challenge – including online brainstorming and a fall workshop –
to meaningfully engage stakeholders. What kind of contributions would
you like to make? What can you envision as possible? Share your thoughts

the way we approach software development. Open Source is a critical
component to our strategy. In 2011, we started a conversation around
open source in government and hosted a summit at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames Research
Center to bring together leaders, policymakers, and developers into the
same room to discuss how best improve the development and release of
open source at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The event resulted in 13 recommendations, which
really shaped our strategy going&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first summit was so helpful to the Agency that we wanted to hold
another, but this time with a broader focus. In 2012, the summit moved
to the Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt; area and the aim was to advance the use of open
source software throughout a wider government audience. The Department
of Veteran’s Affairs and the State Department joined the discussion. The
highly interactive summit highlighted a number of real-world examples,
and help everyone involved make forward progress towards the goal of
helping to improve innovation in government while driving costs&amp;nbsp;down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, we are holding the third Open Source Summit on June 25th and
26th at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt; in Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;. Like the two before, this event will
again bring together an exponentially growing community of open source
developers and leaders from over 11 federal agencies as well as private
industry. We will expand the conversation and focus on the following 3&amp;nbsp;themes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Source Communities: How they work. How to engage with them. How
    to manage&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Converting Closed Communities to Open: If you have a pre-existing
    development community and you are open sourcing the project, how do
    you manage this&amp;nbsp;complexity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a New Community: So you&amp;#8217;re releasing a project or data into
    the wild. How do you find people who care and get them excited about&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven federal agencies have helped plan this summit to help ensure that
the speakers and topics address the real needs of agencies and answer
current questions that government agencies are asking. Tight budgets, a
continual need to innovate, and the rise of open source make this a very
relevant conference for anyone who is involved with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; in government or
community engagement. Here’s a sampling of questions that you can expect
will be&amp;nbsp;addressed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can open source allow me to reduce &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;costs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can open source allow me to create amazing&amp;nbsp;solutions?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are people working in open source&amp;nbsp;communities?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s happening with open source in my mission area (e,g.,health,
    defense,&amp;nbsp;labor)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is closed source no longer the easiest&amp;nbsp;path?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have a project that I want to covert to open source. Now&amp;nbsp;what!?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My agency’s contracts teams are confused about the legal and
    contractual issues involved with procuring and using open source.
    How can I help educate&amp;nbsp;them?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I shift from a government-led model to a community-led&amp;nbsp;model?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s happening at the intersection of open source and open&amp;nbsp;data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s happening with GitHub in&amp;nbsp;government?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What’s happening with Drupal in&amp;nbsp;government?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are other agencies doing that I need to be aware of - or plug&amp;nbsp;into?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can expect a very engaging event, presentations from industry
leaders, and&lt;br /&gt;
face-to-face access to open source practitioners who are in the
trenches solving real-world problems now. If you are interested in the
role open source plays in government, as well as how you can build and
engage an open source community, we encourage you to attend and join us
on June&amp;nbsp;25-26th.&lt;/p&gt;

school. That program ends today, so I&amp;#8217;ll be talking about my time here -
telling my own story for once, as it&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, as a senior of Staples High School, I have won, as a product of
my years of high school servitude, a month of freedom before graduation
to spend at any internship of my choosing. Through a wonderful amalgam
of kismet, effort, Todd Khozein, and Ali Llewellyn, I began my journey
with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Innovation&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went in to this specific internship in a state of mild
fan-girl-freak-out (it&amp;#8217;s freaking &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, man!). To be honest, I&amp;#8217;m not
quite sure what I expected. My imagination was running so fast it
probably could&amp;#8217;ve launched into space. All I knew was that there was the
International Space Apps Challenge, and that I would find some way to
dig into it with hands, feet, and&amp;nbsp;elbows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find a way I did. Within the dawn of my first day as an official &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
intern, I was enveloped in the Open Innovation Team. My passion is for
telling stories and working with data - it was decided I would become
the team&amp;#8217;s story-miner, responsible for discovering the stories behind
the data and participants of the Space Apps Challenge. (It&amp;#8217;s through
this position I discovered that blogging could be used for Actual
Important Business, and not just funny cat gifs.) In seriousness, it&amp;#8217;s
through being the team&amp;#8217;s story-miner that I discovered that my words are
a medium for spreading innovation. As a seventeen-year-old about to go
off to college to &amp;#8220;make something of myself,&amp;#8221; it&amp;#8217;s a powerful
realization. My time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; transformed my language from a tool I have
used all my life to express my needs and opinions into a sword that I
can use to carve my way in&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I seemed to need was a push in the right direction, and a
conveniently placed WordPress account - it makes me think that maybe
this sword has been there all my life, but merely sheathed, and my
mentors and friends at open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; were the ones who only showed me how to
pull it out and let it&amp;nbsp;gleam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I sit here at the end of my official time with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m trying to
reflect back on what I&amp;#8217;ve learned. I learned that working from home, as
I had to do from my small Connecticut residence, is both wonderfully
relaxing and strangely challenging. (No, Kiana, you can&amp;#8217;t watch 5
episodes of &lt;em&gt;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt; in succession, you have calls to make.) I
learned through the patience of the small yet indomitable Sarah Rigdon
how to use Twitter and navigate the streets of Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; in high
heels. From all-around genius Sean Herron, I saw that deadpan sarcasm
and technological savvy are traits to never be undervalued, and from
&amp;#8220;Jedi Master&amp;#8221; Nick Skytland that yes, it is possible to spend 11 hours
on a plane innovating and creating and still return excited and ready to
continue innovating. (Yeah, I didn&amp;#8217;t believe it at first&amp;nbsp;either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From my now-forever mentor, Ali Llewellyn, the things I learned were
both simple and profound. Always discover as many paths to take as
possible, so that you can take the fabled &amp;#8220;one less travelled.&amp;#8221; Hugs are
always appreciated. Just because I&amp;#8217;m only a teenager doesn&amp;#8217;t mean I
can&amp;#8217;t change my own world, and just because it&amp;#8217;s my
own microcosm doesn&amp;#8217;t mean that it can&amp;#8217;t change the macrocosm we call
Earth, or even space. When you talk about meatballs at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, you&amp;#8217;re
probably not referring to Italian food. But most importantly, passion is
what keeps your work alive. Passion is what will revolutionize the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never let go of that&amp;nbsp;passion.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Farewell</title><link href="/farewell" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-14T11:21:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sean Herron</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-14:farewell</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For the past three and a half years, I have called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; home. I started
here in 2010, as an intern in the Outreach Program in the Space
Operations Mission Directorate. Beth Beck, my manager, gave me a
whirlwind tour of how things work in the headquarters of biggest space
agency in the world, then gave me a laptop and sent me forward with a
simple mandate: make something&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little did I know at the time that I was about to embark on an adventure
that would be, in all sense of the phrase, an out of this world
experience. Since coming to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with
countless brilliantly talented people, contribute to projects that are
paving the future for exploration of the universe, and have more
life-changing experiences than I can count. Along the way, I&amp;#8217;ve had a
cadre of amazing mentors and teachers who have given me more than I
could ever give&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which, of course, makes saying goodbye that much&amp;nbsp;harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks my last day of working at the place that was a distant dream
just a few years ago. Although I&amp;#8217;ll miss this place terribly, I look
forward to see how many of the projects I&amp;#8217;ve been fortunate enough to
work on continue to grow and prosper. Initiatives like &lt;a href="http://www.launch.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and
the &lt;a href="http://www.spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; are stronger now than ever
before, and it seems like every day more and more people are reaching
out to us to find out how they can participate in mass collaborations
around the agency&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov"&gt;open source&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work, however, is not over. I&amp;#8217;ve been scrambling before my departure
to integrate one of the solutions from a Challenge I wrote for the Space
Apps Challenge (&lt;a href="https://github.com/ryansb/spacehub"&gt;spacehub&lt;/a&gt;) on to code.nasa.gov, and due to some
incredible last-minute help from one of its developers I&amp;#8217;m hopeful I&amp;#8217;ll
be able to deploy it today before &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; yanks my server access. I&amp;#8217;m
also in the middle of a redesign of open.nasa.gov, the &lt;a href="https://github.com/seanherron/opennasa"&gt;code&lt;/a&gt; of which
is now on GitHub so that its development can be continued in the open.
Beyond that, work continues to help make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s data more open and
accessible. The recent &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-"&gt;Open Data Executive Order&lt;/a&gt; empowers the agency
to continue to be a leader in this area, and I know others on this blog
will continue to think of new exciting ways to involve the public in
helping shape the future of space&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly appreciative to the group of people who I&amp;#8217;ve had as my
&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Family&amp;#8221; over the past few years. I&amp;#8217;m terrible with words, but I
hope they each know just how grateful I am for their incredible
leadership, teachings, and genuine interest in helping me achieve my
dreams. Leaving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was not an easy decision in the slightest, but I am
excited to see where the world takes me in the future. I&amp;#8217;m sure at some
point I&amp;#8217;ll be scanning my badge once again below the giant&amp;nbsp;meatball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, I leave with one of my favorite quotes. A wise snippet of
wisdom (purportedly) given by Alan Shepard, the first American in&amp;nbsp;Space:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one&amp;#8217;s
safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government&amp;nbsp;contract.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Extreme Greenhouse</title><link href="/extreme-greenhouse" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-10T16:29:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sarah Rigdon</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-10:extreme-greenhouse</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greek spinach pie from spinach grown on Mars? Talk about local&amp;nbsp;flavor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Space Apps Athens, it wasn’t such a far-off idea. Themis Karafasoulis
of &lt;a href="http://hackerspace.gr/wiki/Category:Events" title="Hackerspace Athens"&gt;Hackerspace of Athens&lt;/a&gt; says, “When we found out that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; thinks
open, we were sure that we wanted to enter this&amp;nbsp;project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine hackers, including electrical engineers and an aeroponics expert,
came together to develop a solution to the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/deployable-greenhouse/" title="Deployable Greenhouse challenge"&gt;Deployable Greenhouse&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group formed around a fascination with the new frontier of human
colonization on Mars. Many of them had never met before, but they came
together rather—well, there’s no other way to put this—organically.
Aeroponics expert Panos Bairamis says, “Everyone had different ideas to
contribute and so every time we had a problem, someone came up with a
good idea. We really liked&amp;nbsp;that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_8655&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignnone&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;573&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="Popeye

&lt;p&gt;What to grow? They chose spinach because its cultivation is fairly
typical, so the concept could be easily adapted to other plant breeds.
With the design, they focused on creating a deployable greenhouse that
is small, self-sustaining, and easy to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/project/pom/" title="Popeye on Mars"&gt;Popeye on Mars&lt;/a&gt; team has gone on to win Best Mission Concept for
the 2013 International Space Apps Challenge.  A local mediastorm has
followed them since, including a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; spots. “After our win, many
people came to Hackerspace for the first time, and have learned about
open source.” Panos is now offering newcomers to Hackerspace classes on
how to grow with aeroponics, and the Popeye on Mars team continues to
build on their&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panos added a cultural detail: “Here in Greece, when we want to say that
someone is smart, we have an expression. We say, ‘He works at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the magic of participatory collaboration, everyone can work with
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Greener Cities for Greener Living</title><link href="/greener-cities-for-greener-living" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-06T18:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kiana Khozein</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-06:greener-cities-for-greener-living</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I can confess that I have spent many an hour playing with Google&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll descend into street view and roam around places I&amp;#8217;ve never been,
or, more often than not, prowl the streets of my hometown. While fun,
sometimes I can&amp;#8217;t help but think that there ought to be some way for
this incredible technology to have practical applications for the
non-professional admirer, such as&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily, a Space Apps team in Sweden had the same idea, and armed with
the multitudes of global climate data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has provided the world for
free, they set about making this idea a&amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Greener Cities Project has three main goals. One, as previously
mentioned, is to make use of the volumes of data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has provided on
global climate data. Except Greener Cities goes a step further,
incorporating a platform that allows users to add to preexisting data
sets from their own experiences working with the land they monitor and
farm. This first goal works cooperatively with the second, which is to
support local agriculture in the general population. By making
information regarding soil condition and air quality more accessible,
Greener Cities encourages people to utilize the land around them for
farming, even in urban areas. Lastly, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Greener Cities Project
hopes to spark an interest in the environment and programming in young
minds, by giving them a platform to explore such concepts through
revolutionizing the Greener Cities&amp;nbsp;prototype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The entire app was brainstormed and put together during the 2013 Space
Apps Challenge in Gothenburg,&amp;nbsp;Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Mission Report for the 2013 International Space Apps Challenge</title><link href="/mission-report-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-05T12:28:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-05:mission-report-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge is a two-day hackathon where
teams of technologists, scientists, designers, artists, educators,
entrepreneurs, developers, and students collaborate across the globe,
using publicly available data to design innovative solutions for global
challenges in software development, citizen science, hardware, and data
visualization. For the 2013 event, more than 9,000 global citizens in 44
countries and 83 cities engaged directly with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; for the largest
hackathon in history. In just 83 total hours they collectively developed
awe-inspiring software, built jaw-dropping hardware, and created
stunning data visualizations that collectively went a long way to
improving life on Earth and in space. The results? An unbelievable 770
solutions were submitted, thousands of people worked together to address
challenges, and an immeasurable amount of enthusiasm and investment in
exploration was&amp;nbsp;created&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the International Space Apps Challenge represents our latest
efforts in working together – with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; – to enable us all to reach for
new heights and reveal the unknown. The first and second annual events
have been an experiment within government to adapt to the changing
external environment, embrace new technologies, engage with our
citizens, and encourage collaborations and partnerships. This is the
result of the government recognizing that we can be more relevant for
our stakeholders and intentionally create a culture of openness as we
attempt to evolve into &lt;em&gt;a twenty-first century space program for a
twenty-first century&amp;nbsp;democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#8220;meatball&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; don&amp;#8217;t ask) in the upper corner. With the upcoming swarm of
resolution independence due to high &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DPI&lt;/span&gt; screens and a multitude of
screen resolutions, just including a standard &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPG&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; image just
doesn&amp;#8217;t cut it anymore. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVG&lt;/span&gt; icons allow you to include an image that
scales as big or small as you need it, without any loss in image quality
(and often smaller than a comparable image in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPG&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing some research on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVG&lt;/span&gt; images on the web, I came across &lt;a href="https://github.com/adamfairhead/webicons" title="FC Webicons"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FC&lt;/span&gt;
Webicons&lt;/a&gt;, a set of social media icons presented in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVG&lt;/span&gt; with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt;
fallbacks for older browsers that don&amp;#8217;t support &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVG&lt;/span&gt; images. As that code
is open source, I adopted it to present &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s logo in a futuristic,
resolution independent way&amp;#8230;but decided, hey, it was so much fun, why
stop&amp;nbsp;there?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m happy to introduce today &lt;a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Gov-Webicons" title="Gov Webicons"&gt;Gov Webicons&lt;/a&gt;, a set of 41 federal
agency icons that you can use on your website with just two lines of
code. Creating a dashboard of agencies? Include them all. Want to just
update your own agency&amp;#8217;s icon? Take out just the code and images you
need and have fun living in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Gov-Webicons" title="Gov Webicons"&gt;Gov Webicons&lt;/a&gt; is open source and hosted on &lt;a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Gov-Webicons" title="GitHub"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#8217;d love to
include additional federal agencies and can do so as long as there is a
publicly available &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVG&lt;/span&gt; version of their graphic online. Any tips on
improving Gov Webicons or ideas for more agencies to add? Drop me a line
in the comments below, I&amp;#8217;d love to hear your&amp;nbsp;thoughts!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Don’t forget to stop and spot the station.</title><link href="/dont-forget-to-stop-and-spot-the-station" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-04T14:51:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sarah Rigdon</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-04:dont-forget-to-stop-and-spot-the-station</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s Saturday morning at Drexel University’s &lt;a href="http://drexel.edu/excite/" title="Drexel's ExCITe Center"&gt;ExCITe Center&lt;/a&gt; in West
Philadelphia. The first morning of hacking for the 2013 International
Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six students from the University of Pennsylvania’s &lt;a href="http://www.stwing.upenn.edu/index.php" title="UPenn Science and Technology Wing"&gt;Science and
Technology Wing&lt;/a&gt; form a team, including undergrad Alain
Hernandez, with several Arduinos, a Raspberry Pi, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LED&lt;/span&gt; display, servos,
and &amp;#8220;an assortment of other hardware with no idea what we were going to
do with them,&amp;#8221; he says. Several challenges are discussed, including Spot
the&amp;nbsp;Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Space Apps Mainstage opening reception the night before, local
legend &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/profile.cfm?Code=PittsD" title="Derek Pitts"&gt;Derek Pitts&lt;/a&gt; had invited the crowd to guess how many times
they think the International Space Station passes over Philly. Up to
seven times each day? And even urban watchers can see it without a
telescope? They begin to brainstorm ways to bring this information to a
wider variety of&amp;nbsp;audiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a team of six others had formed and were considering the same
challenge. “In the spirit of collaboration,” says teammate
Kai Ninomiya, “we decided to talk to the other group about our
ideas—both to help us all with ideas and to avoid redundancy.” There is
no team size limit, so they combine their&amp;nbsp;powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another corner, local high school student Himavath Jois reads the
challenge descriptions over breakfast, considering his options. “Then,
Leland Melvin came over to talk to me and brought me into the
atmosphere,” he recalls. How often does an astronaut personally enlist
your help? He can’t refuse, and the team acquires another&amp;nbsp;builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the start to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Base Station, which has gone on to win Best Use
of Hardware for extending the functionality of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/" title="NASA's Spot the Station"&gt;Spot the
Station&lt;/a&gt; alert system, further connecting people on Earth to the
International Space&amp;nbsp;Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Base Station is part software, part hardware, and all art. An iOS
app not only tracks the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; but incorporates augmented reality to make
it easier to spot and share its location on social media. In addition, a
web app pushes data to the hardware piece, a statue that points to the
station as it passes&amp;nbsp;overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project connected several different skill sets, enabling the
teammates to work most closely on their interests while observing others
in action. Project manager Dan Giovanni helped connect each component
and make sure the process ran&amp;nbsp;smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jois says skills learned with his high school robotics team helped him
tackle the hardware component. “I’m not too interested in sitting in
front of a computer for a long time and programming for hours on end,
but I liked getting my hands into what I was doing.” Andrew Kondrath
also helped build the demo using locally made K’&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEX&lt;/span&gt; sets, two servos,
and an Arduino. “All of the equipment probably cost less than \$75,” he
says. “It could be done much&amp;nbsp;cheaper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cartographer Patrick Hammons joined the team, initially drawn to
mapping. “There’s a geospatial element to [Space Apps], which is unique
among hackathons,” he says. It was also an opportunity to see the
connection between an initial tracker map and the software and hardware.
“Seeing how the software works from beginning stage to final product, I
felt like I learned a lot more about it in that&amp;nbsp;way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local designer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TK&lt;/span&gt; Rodgers had just recently heard about hackathons and
couldn’t wait to get involved. &lt;a href="http://phillytechweek.com/" title="Philly Tech Week"&gt;Philly Tech Week&lt;/a&gt; was just weeks away
at the time, and connected her to several opportunities, including Space
Apps. “After finding out that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; is accessible to everyone on Earth
if assisted by tech to know when and how to spot the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;, I was
completely sold on the project. Having both Leland Melvin and Derrick
Pitts with us made space so much closer, and I wanted to be able to
share a bit of that feeling with the rest of the&amp;nbsp;world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is excited about their win, but also excited to continue the
work. They hope to further outfit the hardware component, perhaps with
custom 3D-printed parts. The goal is to fortify it for standing up to
wear in science and tech classrooms, or as a public art&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I saw a lot of really cool and innovative projects, both at the local
event and on the challenge website, and I know that was only a fraction
of what was accomplished at the challenge,” says Kondrath. “It&amp;#8217;s amazing
what people can accomplish over a&amp;nbsp;weekend.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Big Pockets, Bigger Ideas</title><link href="/big-pockets-bigger-ideas" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-04T13:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kiana Khozein</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-04:big-pockets-bigger-ideas</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I was young, the first mentor I ever had taught me a valuable
lesson about new vocabulary&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said that every time I learned a new word, from that point on I then
owned that word. I could put it in my pocket for safekeeping, she said,
to take out and then use whenever I&amp;nbsp;wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend was the &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org/" title="National Day of Civic Hacking"&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. I spent Saturday
morning in Arlington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VA&lt;/span&gt;, speaking with developers whose projects
included making rescue missions safer for firefighters and decreasing
the amount of homeless on the streets. Later, I ended up at Google in
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, where another #hackforchange event was taking place. One of the
most memorable projects there came from a high school sophomore and his
brother, who developed apps that ranged from finding a far-parked car to
sending out texts to preset emergency contacts when one&amp;#8217;s phone&amp;nbsp;died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child, my pockets had been used for words. But in these hackers I
saw that they had pockets big enough to fit many words, strung together
by inspiration to form ideas and projects. And not only could their
pockets fit these ideas, but they took that innovation and used it to
construct products that would ease the life of the average&amp;nbsp;human.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that was the most striking thing for me. So often people succumb
to cynicism - it&amp;#8217;s easier to not care about the issues that face the
planet, that face humanity. This makes way for those with the selfish
agenda - politicians seeking to gain a good reputation or corporations
grasping for whatever they can wring from the public. Despite all that,
the National Day of Civic Hacking showed me that real people &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care
about making the world better. These hackers devote their time and
effort to these apps for free, simply in the hope that one day their
creations will make the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sitting here at my desk in Connecticut, I hear words like &amp;#8220;change,&amp;#8221;
&amp;#8220;revolutionize,&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;innovate&amp;#8221; every day. One can forget the true
meaning of those words the more they are casually thrown about in
conference calls and emails. But the National Day of Civic Hacking
proved to me that there are people in this world who do not numb their
humanity, but take the tools they have developed and strive forth to
build something lasting and meaningful for their fellow&amp;nbsp;man.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Add me on</title><link href="/add-me-on" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-06-01T14:47:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kiana Khozein</name></author><id>tag:,2013-06-01:add-me-on</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;At openNASA, we fulfill our mission by helping you pursue your&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USDA&lt;/span&gt;, this mission included raising awareness about the
viability of hyper-local agriculture, specifically in but not limited to
the United States. They accomplished this by creating the Backyard
Poultry Farmer challenge. The concept was simple: by promoting localized
agriculture - such as a chicken farm in one&amp;#8217;s backyard - the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USDA&lt;/span&gt; hoped
to revolutionize a system in which healthier food would become more
viable to greater numbers of people. The challenge had thus been set,
and all they needed now was a team that would champion it, the pioneers
to give it the renown it&amp;nbsp;deserved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter Bulgaria with the ChicksBook&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story of ChicksBook begins with a company called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISG&lt;/span&gt; Technology. In
the summer of 2012, Atanas Keranov began work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISG&lt;/span&gt; Tech as a junior
net developer, where he met Pavel Kolev, a two-year veteran of the
company and fellow net developer. Hitting it off, the pair decided to
test their new-found creative chemistry by entering in a Bulgarian
programming competition organized by Telerik Academy and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PC&lt;/span&gt; Magazine, as
the two-person team KeyDown. KeyDown went on in that competition to win
two out of the three rounds they competed&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming fresh from this successful run, Keranov and Kolev decided to try
their hands at Space Apps 2013. However, they knew from their experience
in the Bulgarian competition that they needed specialists on the graphic
design and web development front if they were to successfully create
their app in time. So, the duo opened up their team to the applications
of any graphic designer who shared their enthusiasm for the concept of
Space Apps and their willingness to work almost for free. Thus, they
found Stoyan Ivanov, who ended up participating in the challenge only
virtually. However, this did not stop Ivanov later from almost
single-handedly creating the design for the ChicksBook website and app
in just two&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure that they would have a working model online by the end of the
challenge, Keranov and Kolev called in Ivan Zhekov, a web developer who
they knew could push their project to completion. Kiril Nikolov, already
a friend to Keranov and Kolev, was known to both men as a superb source
of enthusiasm and positivity; this, coupled with his hand for
development, made him the essential ingredient to the formation of what
was soon to be the ChicksBook team. Thus assembled, they struck off to
conquer Space Apps&amp;nbsp;Sofia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, the only matter was to pick a challenge. Luckily for the team, this
was not as difficult as&amp;nbsp;expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Backyard Poultry Farmer challenge almost immediately caught they
guys&amp;#8217; eyes - why on earth were chickens important to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;? But after a
bit of investigation, they realized this challenge was the one for them.
In Bulgaria, local agriculture is far more common than in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;. In
fact, most of the team members have grandparents in Bulgaria who
actually raise chickens in their backyards. Using this cultural
relevancy, they found a way to help both their community and the world
by creating a platform that addresses the practical challenges and
applications of raising poultry. They created their app using an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;
that allows for both Android and iOS mobile applications. The team
remains grateful to Telerik Academy for their extensive support in
helping gain knowledge and experience in software&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, can I add you on&amp;nbsp;ChicksBook?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>What’s the weather like on Mars right now?

one constant: weather apps. Everyone has one. Perhaps you’ve found that
one perfect weather app and would never stray. Perhaps you’ve read this
sentence in too many tech reviews to believe it, but it’s the truth:
you’ve never seen a weather app like this&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Sol, the world’s first interplanetary weather app, winner of the
award for Best Use of Data at the 2013 International Space Apps&amp;nbsp;Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its makers were drawn to the ubiquity of weather apps when hatching
ideas for the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/wish-you-were-here/" title="Wish You Were Here challenge"&gt;Wish You Were Here&lt;/a&gt; challenge at Space Apps Kansas
City. Everybody has a weather app, they thought—why not use that to
connect people to&amp;nbsp;space?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to teammate and president of Kansas City-based Ingenology,
Mike Wilson, the team was drawn to the universality of the challenge.
Teammate Jessica Meurers brought her love of science to the table and
began to discuss her ideas with another designer. They discovered they
had independently come up with similar ideas. In this organic way, the
entire team dove into the&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their goals was to address &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Mars weather data, which is
difficult for users to grab. So, they made a developer friendly, open
source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, the Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System, the code for
which is open and available for tinkering. This is based on the Rover
Environmental Monitoring Station data provided by &lt;a href="http://www.cab.inta.es/en/inicio" title="Centro de Astrobiología"&gt;Centro de
Astrobiología&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They knew design would be key: apps with beautiful graphics are hard to
put down. Sharing is also important, so they integrated a sharing
feature. Users are able to Tweet or share the weather from Gale Crater
on Mars or from anywhere on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download the result for yourself now in the App Store, for
iPhone or iPad, and commenters are already asking for more planets. The
Android app will be published in&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Smile in T-10, 9, 8…</title><link href="/smile-in-t-10-9-8" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-29T14:28:00-04:00</updated><author><name>khozeinkj</name></author><id>tag:,2013-05-29:smile-in-t-10-9-8</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last week, we announced the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/05/22/global-award-winners-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge/"&gt;Best in Class for the 2013 International
Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. The stories of these solutions and the teams
who created them are too good not to share. Thus, we bring you a series
of Best in Class&amp;nbsp;profiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are the voyages of the Space Apps&amp;nbsp;Challenge…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all began with a&amp;nbsp;burrito.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before Kate Gray remembered that there was such a thing as the
International Space Apps Challenge, or realized that it had set
challenges, she was looking up at the London&amp;nbsp;sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A self-professed “proper space geek,” Gray contemplated the perpetual
Londonian cloud cover that rarely allowed photographs from space of the
historic city. Ideas that utilized today’s gadget-heavy culture to help
coordinate missions were already percolating throughout space culture.
Recalling a conversation with Tim Peake, renowned British astronaut, in
which they discussed the practicality and efficiency of iPads and apps
to astronauts, Gray was struck by inspiration. Her idea: an interfacing
system between astronauts in the International Space Station and
ordinary people on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if there was an app that established direct communication between
astronauts and civilians that allowed them to track and schedule
viewings of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; from Earth? What if this same app also checked local
weather conditions beforehand, thereby saving precious time usually
wasted on waiting for the clouds to clear for good&amp;nbsp;photography?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is almost everyone’s childhood dream to be able to wave to an
astronaut in space, and Gray was no exception. With the brainchild that
would become T-10, and win the Best in Class category of Most Inspiring,
she set out to find a team tech-savvy enough to make it&amp;nbsp;reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mutual calling to see the aurora in Finland brought together Gray and
Joao Neves, one primarily on the computer-tech side of things who
expressed interest in becoming more involved with space-centered
projects. The two grabbed lunch and discussed future possibilities of
working together. Recalling Space Apps, Gray proposed an idea: if Neves
could make her project a reality, she would arrange his lodging in
London. – “Remember this moment,” Gray jokingly told her new associate
over that fateful burrito. “This is where it all&amp;nbsp;starts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They had the idea for the app provided by Gray, and the data synthesis
skillset from Neves, but they still needed team members skilled in the
ways of app coding and design. By initiating a powerful Twitter
campaign, the two found their app coder, a mutual tech and radio friend
by the name of Ketan Majmudar. He provided the development front
necessary to get T-10 functional. All they needed now was a good&amp;nbsp;design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London event was underway, and the T-10 team – at this point, only
Gray, Neves, and Majmudar – was galvanized by excitement. Rushing
around, Gray overheard the arrival of Dario Lofish, a designer of whom
she knew. Gray wasted no time – “Join our team!” she blurted, before
excitedly describing the concept behind T-10. After some deliberation,
Lofish returned, ready to take part. His skills for design and marketing
were exactly what the team needed, giving the project an exterior sheen
that reflected the hardcore programming of the app&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a matter of 48 hours, the team transformed from a collection of near
strangers to a tightly knit group of friends, all bouncing off of
spectacular creative chemistry and a semi-dangerous Red Bull:blood
ratio, to produce an app that every astronaut they talked to (2)
expressed serious interest in&amp;nbsp;using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although T-10 may have won the London challenge and one of the six Best
in Class titles, the project’s initiative doesn’t end there, as
evidenced by their continued effort to gain endorsement from astronauts
to take T-10&amp;nbsp;live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their first goal, an undoubted success, was to emerge from the cloud of
creativity and innovation that is the International Space Apps&amp;nbsp;Challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their next one:&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>One Year Anniversary of the NASA Digital Strategy</title><link href="/one-year-anniversary-of-the-nasa-digital-strategy" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-23T12:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2013-05-23:one-year-anniversary-of-the-nasa-digital-strategy</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Do you follow any astronauts on Twitter mainly for their photos of Earth
from space? Did you know they’re taking those pictures from a space
station that travels 5 miles per second? Now there’s an app that
calculates photo ops and conditions for photographs, making it much
easier for them to capture those photos we all&amp;nbsp;love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever looked up and wondered where that space station is? Now,
you can use one of many apps to tell you exactly when the space station
orbits overhead, and you don’t even need a&amp;nbsp;telescope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or have you wondered where on Mars the Curiosity Rover is right now, and
how cold it must be? Now, you can find that out from your phone. Sol,
the world’s first interplanetary weather app, is now available for&amp;nbsp;download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where did all these amazing apps and APIs come&amp;nbsp;from?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year since the launch of the Digital Government Strategy,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has made its data and services more and more accessible to the
world. Through technology development events such as the International
Space Apps Challenge and the National Day of Civic Hacking, developers,
researchers, entrepreneurs, and citizens like you have shaped that data
into apps and APIs that more closely connect us to our planet and our&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, most of our questions are rooted in one commitment: to explore,
and to connect everyone on Earth to that exploration. How do we make
space data more alive and tangible to&amp;nbsp;everyone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is extremely committed to implementing directives such as the
Digital Government Strategy, the Open Government Initiative, and the new
Open Data Executive Order. Together, these three directives are
important steps forward for government agencies like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. They
encourage agencies to open up their valuable data to the public and give
external developers tools to build new technology and services. They
enable us to keep pace with the rapid deployment of mobile technology
and rising citizen expectations, and ensure our technology is available
to citizens anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Most importantly, at
the core of these initiatives is a new approach to how government works
and delivers its services to the American&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of the anniversary, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has updated the status of all the
milestones for the Digital Strategy, released a number of new mobile
applications, made more data available through APIs, and created a page
for developers looking for more information. We encourage you to check
out the following related links. We’ve also included some notable
Digital Strategy highlights&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Digital Strategy Milestones&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy/"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/developer/"&gt;open.nasa.gov/developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/developer/"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Plan&amp;nbsp;v2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 dir="ltr"&gt;Notable Digital Strategy&amp;nbsp;Highlights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;data.nasa.gov &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;code.nasa.gov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; engages with the public through a variety of avenues, but perhaps
the most relevant to the Digital Strategy initiative is our commitment
to open data and open source software. Two platforms, data.nasa.gov and
code.nasa.gov, serve as the home for the Agency&amp;#8217;s efforts in these
areas. Code.nasa.gov expands &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open source activities, surfaces
existing activities, and guides internal and external groups in open
development, release, and contribution. In doing so, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; hopes to lower
barriers to building open technology in partnership with the public.
Data.nasa.gov is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s flagship platform for sharing information about
the vast stores of data we collect and store, with over 100 years of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists, and many others can contribute
directly to the exploration of space and Earth by bringing new
perspectives to the data. The Agency continues to work to improve data
accessibility and is actively incentivizing the use of government data
by citizens. To address the ever-increasing amount of tools and data
catalogs that are publicly available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s many websites, this
directory lists publicly available datasets and serves to streamline the
process for posting them on data.gov. The directory includes information
and direct links to more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov/"&gt;code.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;APIs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; sees huge promise in web APIs, as they can enhance our ability to
deliver data to both established and new audiences. Although the Agency
offers petabytes of publicly available data to the world from a variety
of missions, only a small portion is accessible through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; interfaces.
The Digital Strategy mandate directed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to use web APIs to make
available high-value data and content for at least two existing major
customer-facing systems. Examples of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-produced APIs&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data.nasa.gov &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; allows a machine-readable interface to return
metadata from the site organized by category, tag, date, or search
term. We’re hoping this allows new and creative visualizations of the
data resources &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; provides to the public. Additionally, it is a
learning experience for us as we work to expand transparency,
participation, and collaboration at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; through new uses of&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/"&gt;http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;Earth Observing System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt;) Clearinghouse (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-developed Earth Observing System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt;) Clearinghouse (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt;)
is a spatial and temporal metadata registry and order broker built by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Earth Science Data and Information System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESDIS&lt;/span&gt;) that enables
the science community to more easily use and exchange &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s data and
services. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s main objective is to enable broader use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EOS&lt;/span&gt;
data. It allows users to more efficiently search and access data and
services, and increases the potential for interoperability with new
tools and services. The value of these resources increases with the
potential to exchange and interoperate. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt; has been working with
other organizations to provide their Earth science metadata alongside
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s for users to search and access. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt; stores metadata from a
variety of science disciplines and domains, including Climate
Variability and Change, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Earth Surface and
Interior, Atmospheric Composition, Weather, and Water and Energy&amp;nbsp;Cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/"&gt;http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;Heliocentric Trajectories Web&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; offering heliocentric trajectories for selected spacecraft,
planets, and&amp;nbsp;comets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/"&gt;http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;Satellite Situation Center &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Satellite Situation Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt;) web services allow a software
developer to use portions of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt; software in their own
applications. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt; is a system to cast geocentric spacecraft location
information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions and
mappings of spacecraft locations along lines of the Earth&amp;#8217;s magnetic
field. This capability is one key to mission science planning (both
single missions and coordinated observations of multiple spacecraft
with ground-based investigations) and to subsequent multi-mission data&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/"&gt;http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;Coordinated Data Analysis System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt;) Web&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Coordinated Data Analysis System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt;) web services allow a
software developer to use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt; services in their own applications.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt; supports simultaneous multi-mission, multi-instrument selection
and comparison of science data among a wide range of current space
missions. While CDAWeb provides access to this data through an
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;-based user interface, these web services provides a (web)
application programming interface (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;) to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt;. If you are developing
an application that requires science data from any &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt;-held datasets,
then the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDAS&lt;/span&gt; web services will provide an interface to the data for
your&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/"&gt;http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With constrained budgetary resources and the large, complex, and legacy
systems our data is housed in, however, relying solely on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data
owners to release APIs is not the best approach to opening our data to
the world. Thus, our strategy has been to launch a series of challenges
and collaboration opportunities to enable citizen developers around the
world to help us in our quest to further the transparency and
accessibility of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data systems. Events like the International Space
Apps Challenge create opportunities for thousands of citizen developers
from across the planet to contribute their time, and help the agency
create front-end APIs for many of our legacy data&amp;nbsp;systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has hosted two International Space Apps Challenge events, the first
in April 2012 and the second in April 2013. In the 2013 event, over
9,100 participants at over 83 cities around the world created 770
unique, open source solutions for a series of challenges the agency
issued. The challenges varied in scope and subject, from creating data
visualizations to designing more efficient air traffic control systems
to creating new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; interfaces for legacy datasets. With relatively
little investment from the Agency, dozens of unique APIs were born out
of the initiative, many of which are listed below. Going forward, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
hopes to hold more events like the International Space Apps Challenge in
collaboration with our own internal efforts. In adopting these APIs, we
can harness the power of citizen collaboration to assist us in reaching
our&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;ExoAPI&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ExoAPI is a powerful tool that provides access to exoplanet data
through a simple RESTful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Developed as part of Space Apps
Challenge&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://exoapi.com/"&gt;http://exoapi.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;SkyMorph/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEAT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; wraps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s SkyMorph archive in a RESTful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; interface.
Currently, it provides observation and image data from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEAT&lt;/span&gt;
survey. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asterank.com/skymorph"&gt;http://www.asterank.com/skymorph&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;Asterank &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asterank database is a thin layer over the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; Small Body
Database, merged with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; Delta-V data, published asteroid mass data,
and our own calculations. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.asterank.com/api"&gt;http://www.asterank.com/api&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;{&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAAS&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The {&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAAS&lt;/span&gt;} &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is an open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; built to make it easier and
more efficient to build interactive applications that want to utilize
the wealth of weather data being transmitted by the Curiosity Rover on
Mars. Our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; is built upon the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REMS&lt;/span&gt; (Rover Environmental Monitoring
Station) data provided by the Centro de Astrobiologia (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSIC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTA&lt;/span&gt;).
Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HORIZONS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Description of system: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HORIZONS&lt;/span&gt; is a part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. It is an online solar system data and ephemeris
computation service that provides access to key solar system data and
flexible production of highly accurate ephemerides for solar system
objects. Through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HORIZONS&lt;/span&gt; system, we have opened up their
online solar system data and ephemeris computation service to the web,
via a RESTful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://nasa.api.niewma.com/"&gt;http://nasa.api.niewma.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;The Blue Marble &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blue Marble &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; provides programmatic access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; images of the
Earth by location. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://bigmarbleapi.azurewebsites.net/Help"&gt;http://bigmarbleapi.azurewebsites.net/Help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;Predict the Sky &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We combine global weather data with a comprehensive library of space
events, from the International Space Station passing overhead to
planets visible to the naked eye. Simple &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; calls let you find out
when the next interesting space events will be visible, from any
location worldwide. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://predictthesky.org/"&gt;http://predictthesky.org&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h4 dir="ltr"&gt;Optimized Mobile&amp;nbsp;Services&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mobile devices continue to count for a larger percentage of overall
web traffic in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has strived to offer a variety of services
in mobile friendly offerings, including via specialized mobile
applications, mobile optimized websites, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; gateways. The Digital
Strategy mandate directed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to optimize at least two existing
priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for
improving additional existing services. As with the APIs, however,
constrained budgetary resources have contributed to an environment in
which relying solely on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; programs to release mobile interfaces is
not the best approach to furthering this objective. Increasing
accessibility for our services and optimizing them for mobile users is
ongoing work that will continue far into the future. Here are six
examples of recently optimized services developed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mobile&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; app is the public’s window to the universe. The free app,
which aggregates a variety of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; web content, services and
individual apps, and also includes a mobile-optimized website, is
available for iPhone and Android devices. It offers live streaming
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Television coverage of agency missions and events, showcases more
than 11,000 images of Earth, the solar system and beyond and even lets
users track the International Space Station and learn when the
orbiting laboratory will fly over their&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;WebTADS&amp;nbsp;Mobile&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WebTADS Mobile is a lighter version of the desktop-based WebTADS
developed to provide &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; civil servants with the convenience of
recording time when they&amp;#8217;re not in the office or connected via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VPN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.nasa.gov/content/webtads"&gt;https://apps.nasa.gov/content/webtads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Contacts&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look up your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; colleagues&amp;#8217; contact information directly from your&amp;nbsp;phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.nasa.gov/content/nasa-contacts"&gt;https://apps.nasa.gov/content/nasa-contacts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;iARC&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iARC is a mobile app specifically for Ames Research Center that will
allow Ames users to search buildings on campus by name or pinpoint on
the map, see location relative to their own, and stay informed with
the latest&amp;nbsp;news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.nasa.gov/content/iarc"&gt;https://apps.nasa.gov/content/iarc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;iMorpheus&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Morpheus is testing a new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft at the Johnson Space
Center, and the iMorpheus iOS app aims to bring you right to the
center of the action! iMorpheus streams real lander telemetry from the
Christopher C. Kraft, Jr. Mission Control Center and builds a live,
real-time 3D simulation during actual engine and performance tests. If
the lander isn&amp;#8217;t being tested, you can just go to manual and have your
own virtual test flight around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://apps.nasa.gov/content/imorpheus#!prettyPhoto"&gt;https://apps.nasa.gov/content/imorpheus#!prettyPhoto&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;App&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; App showcases a huge collection of the latest &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; content,
including images, videos on-demand, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Television, mission
information, news and feature stories, latest tweets, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; sighting
opportunities, satellite tracking, Third Rock Radio, and much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.gov&amp;nbsp;Mobile&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.gov offers a mobile optimized version of the frontpage that
enables easier navigation for mobile&amp;nbsp;visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

More than 9,000 hackers, designers, and explorers in 83 cities and from
all corners of the world made this the largest hackathon in history. An
unbelievable 770 solutions were submitted, and thousands of people
worked together to address challenges and create immeasurable amount of
enthusiasm and investment in&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those solutions, 134 were nominated for global recognition. Over the
past few weeks we have reviewed each and every one of them, a truly
inspirational process. A panel of judges consisting of representatives
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and other governmental and non-governmental organizations
evaluated the top solutions, and today we are announcing the six best in
class&amp;nbsp;winners.&lt;/p&gt;

Through this time I’ve been documenting and getting ready for this
moment, to tell you my story. I’ll start from the beginning and share
how I got here in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Day&amp;nbsp;#1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago, I was a senior in high school interning in the Office of
Education. I  was participating in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; innovation day scavenger
hunt, and had no idea of the discoveries I was going to make that day.
One of the challenges was to go into building 29 and take a picture with
all the green chairs in the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/space/"&gt;sp.ace&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first time I saw
the collaborative work space and I completely fell in love with the
whiteboards, writable tables, all the macs, the liquid galaxy, and just
the vibe I got from the room.  Here, I met these incredible people that
taught me the benefits of a transparent environment and collaboration,
and shared their goals to influence this way of thinking throughout the
 center. I suddenly felt like I had been isolated by my cubicle; I saw
this as my opportunity to leave my little box and  simply &lt;em&gt;asked how can
I work for you?&lt;/em&gt; The response I got in return caught me by complete
surprise,  “&lt;em&gt;what would you like to work on, and what can we do for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;
to make that happen?&lt;/em&gt;”  That was it. I couldn&amp;#8217;t believe i was still in
Johnson Space Center. This question gave me the freedom to find my very
own projects and work on the things I was actually interested&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;#35&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first blogpost listed every space app on both android and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IOS&lt;/span&gt;
platforms. This list of 46 apps was then noticed and featured on
&lt;a href="http://fedscoop.com/nasa-has-46-apps-for-that/"&gt;fedscoop&lt;/a&gt; and later retweeted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The real reason this was
special to me was because this was the first time I collaborated and it
was a complete accident. I was in the sp.ace trying to make my banner
stand out by using a bootlegged photoshop that wasn&amp;#8217;t cooperating with
me. Another intern was working in the sp.ace that same day, and he
happened to have photoshop on his laptop and he also happened to be a
photoshop ninja! I almost wanted to keep that  a secret. To my surprise,
when I told my mentor about this partnership she encouraged this kind of
performance. My cubicle was something that I gladly sacrificed for this
type of&amp;nbsp;collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2012-10-03-at-10.15.16-AM.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screen Shot 2012-10-03 at 10.15.16 AM" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Screen-Shot-2012-10-03-at-10.15.16-AM.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Day&amp;nbsp;#55&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last astronomy day, I tagged along with a few Co-ops from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; to
volunteer at the George Observatory. We were involved with all the kid
activities, and  my job was to help make clip-on buttons of cool space
pictures that we cut out of magazines. We then gave them out for free!
Later in the day, when everyone was looking through telescopes we went
around to every line and asked people random questions about space. It
was really fun to see the  kids getting  very competitive. The event
coordinators surprised us with a challenge.  We were able to simulate
a spaceflight (I was an astronaut), through their mission control and
space station mockups. It was a great&amp;nbsp;experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/astronomy.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="astronomy" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/astronomy.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/astronomyday.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="astronomyday" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/astronomyday.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;#62&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wings over Houston was also another volunteer experience. I joined
Public Affairs and helped them manage their exhibit. Being seen as a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; representative to the public eye made me appreciate this experience
so much more. I really enjoyed educating the public and getting them
excited about space food! I was able to meet a lot of great people, not
to mention enjoy the awesome airshow. I cherish the volunteer time that
I’ve gained mostly  because in the past when I tried to to volunteer for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; I was simply ignored. I&amp;#8217;m well aware of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RARE&lt;/span&gt; it is for a young
student like me to get an internship experience like this one so I made
sure to take advantage of any tour, lecture, or volunteer experience
that was presented to&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Day&amp;nbsp;#103&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While working in an open environment like the collaborative work spaces
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;, it’s easy to find people that enjoy talking about their goals.
I’ve been exposed to so many new projects, concepts, ideas, and
somewhere in between  I even found someone that had been working on
something very similar to my project. I was in the process of making the
center&amp;#8217;s buildings 3D on Google Earth, but I could not find the
dimensions that I needed in order to make the buildings proportional.
After bugging people for the dimensions for about a month my solution
walked in and sat on the table right across from me. He was working on a
app for new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; employees that would have a map and a small description
of the buildings to help them get around. Luckily, he knew someone that
had the dimensions and was more than willing to share them with&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Day&amp;nbsp;#225&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side project, I was  planning to shoot a video for the Career
Exploration Program. Through this video we wanted to show our mentors
how our life was impacted by this program, and why it&amp;#8217;s important to
keep programs like this one alive.  At the same time, I was helping with
the preparation of the International Space Apps Challenge and found that
there was a “for the record” challenge calling for a solution that would
allow &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; interns to share their experience gained from their
educational program. How could I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; tackle this&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[vimeo 65449549 w=500&amp;nbsp;h=281]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge played a huge role in my
internship. I had always thought about collaboration within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;. This
was the first time I saw the big picture, and the first time I was
exposed to this idea of &lt;em&gt;mass collaboration&lt;/em&gt;. I was able to incorporate
my video into that challenge, and decided to bring my project to the
Space Apps Houston event where complete strangers were more than willing
to help us send our message. We got many new ideas for the introduction
part our video, and in result came up with many different version of
this&amp;nbsp;video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[vimeo 65454737 w=500&amp;nbsp;h=281]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge was my first hackathon and a huge
learning experience. Being in this environment full of people that were
dedicating their free time to enhance their community  created this
great attitude that was almost contagious! We refused to act like a
 bunch of strangers in one room, we were connected through this passion
for space that we all shared, and by the challenges we were all trying
to&amp;nbsp;solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day&amp;nbsp;#245&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These people have impacted my life abundantly as advisers and as
friends. I can&amp;#8217;t thank them enough for making this amazing experience
possible. I know that I won&amp;#8217;t miss them because these are the mentors
that will advise me in the future; these are the friends I will keep
sharing my story with.&lt;img alt="phpFJmv6nAM" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/phpFJmv6nAM.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>BOLIDES - Visualizing Meteorite Impacts</title><link href="/bolides-visualizing-meteorite-impacts" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-10T09:49:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2013-05-10:bolides-visualizing-meteorite-impacts</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We are always on the lookout for great visualizations of space data and

*This is a cross-post from the [National Day of Civic Hacking][]
website.  *

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org/"&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt; is bringing together thousands of
civic hackers on June 1st and 2nd. But what is a civic hacker,&amp;nbsp;anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Civic hackers&amp;#8221; as we think about it for the &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org/"&gt;National Day of Civic
Hacking&lt;/a&gt; are technologists, civil servants, designers, entrepreneurs,
engineers - anybody - who is willing to collaborate with others to
create, build, and invent to address challenges relevant to our
neighborhoods, our cities, our states and our&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people have negative connotations of what it means to be a
‘hacker.’  How are ‘civic hackers’ different from the negative
perception that exists about hackers? To us, a hacker is someone who
uses a minimum of resources and a maximum of brainpower and ingenuity to
create, enhance or fix&amp;nbsp;something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a National Day of Civic Hacking organizer named Charlie
shared this powerful story with us around how he explains what a civic
hacker does and the challenge of helping others see that civic hacking
is a good&amp;nbsp;thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;It was my father that helped with this problem. He is 92, active and a
veteran of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt;. He pointed out that he first heard the term “hacker”
during the early days of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WWII&lt;/span&gt; in the South Pacific. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Navy was
not prepared for war and was getting beaten pretty badly. He was there.
When fighter planes would return from action they would be shot up and
in many cases crashed on landing because their pilots were injured. Each
night huge teams of mechanics would converge upon the wrecked planes and
“hack” at them, removing the good parts from several and building a new
plane over night from all the salvaged pieces. He told me they were
referred to as the “hacker details.” That was because they had to use
metal “hacksaws” as they cut away the damaged panels of the planes. At
92 he seems to think that is the original root of the term because he
said it was very commonly used during the war 60 years&amp;nbsp;ago.&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie is putting together a &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org/dawsonville-maker-day"&gt;Maker Faire in Dawsonville,
Georgia&lt;/a&gt; for National Day of Civic Hacking in coordination with the
Dawson County Development Authority in Dawsonville,&amp;nbsp;Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s not let the conversation stop here.  It is just getting started.
 Now, tell us how you will define civic hacking for yourself and your&amp;nbsp;community?&lt;/p&gt;

together for the first ever &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org"&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The national event will take place June 1-2, 2013, in \~80 cities across
the nation. The initiative is a united effort to connect citizens and
government in a partnership focused on improving people’s daily lives
through technology. This event will bring together techies,
entrepreneurs, do-gooders, activists and others like you from across the
nation to collaboratively create, build, and invent tools using
publicly-released data. We hope to create solutions that are directly
relevant to our neighborhoods, our cities, our states and our&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited about partnering with 14 other government agencies as
well as a number of other organizations and organizers everywhere on the
National Day because we believe it is an opportunity to once again
leverage the expertise and entrepreneurial spirit of those outside
federal, state and local government to drive meaningful,
technology-based solutions for government and society. It demonstrates
what&amp;#8217;s possible when we all work together to strengthen our society and
our lives. National Day of Civic Hacking will bring innovation out of
your neighbors and you. It is meant to make innovation within reach
rather than something you hear about in tech-savvy&amp;nbsp;cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking brings together communities together over
two days, but helps you share and communicate with communities across
America about issues you care about most. Anyone can participate to
collaboratively create, build, and invent new solutions using
publicly-released data, code and technology. You don’t have to be an
expert in technology, but you do have to care about your neighborhood
and community to&amp;nbsp;participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to find an event in your city and to get involved If
there is not an event planned near you, start one! You can visit
hackforchange.org and see all the event details as well as the
challenges that we&amp;#8217;ll be working on, including the challenge offered by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; - &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org/challenge/we-love-data"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We Love Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221; Our &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org/challenge/we-love-data"&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; recognizes
that government agencies like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; have vasts amounts of information
that can be used to improve our lives. We want to see what you can do
with space data to empower citizens everywhere in their daily lives
while at the same time connecting them with our nation&amp;#8217;s exploration and
aeronautics&amp;nbsp;missions.&lt;/p&gt;

The weekend is over&amp;#8230; but #SpaceApps is definitely
still on and moving into global judging! You can read the specifics of
how judging and awards will work &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/04/19/spaceapps-judging-and-awards/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next steps for projects and teams that won their local event and are
globally&amp;nbsp;nominated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1. &lt;strong&gt;You need to be sure that your project page is as complete as
possible.&lt;/strong&gt; All team members, all code, links to any photos,
presentations and datasets, social accounts if you have them - the more
information you have included on your page, the better. If you have a
software project where the code is not included, you will not be
eligible for&amp;nbsp;judging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​2. &lt;strong&gt;You need to make a video.&lt;/strong&gt; For local judging, you gave a
presentation in person. For global judging, we need you to make a video
introducing your team, describing and demo-ing your solution. The video
can be simple or fancy, but should be no more than 2 minutes and should
highlight the impact of your project.&lt;strong&gt; You will have until May 1,
2013&lt;/strong&gt; to submit a video describing your challenge and solution and link
it to your project&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;

your challenge or thought it was important, what you accomplished, how
you got there, and what the next steps&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should also start to think about sharing the story of your project

Space Center who works on technologies for mining the Moon, Mars, and
asteroids; for developing extraterrestrial spaceports; and for robotic
industry in space. Outside his day job he &lt;a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; on his vision for
extending human civilization into the solar system (and graciously
allowed us to &lt;a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/space-hackers-colonize-solar-system/"&gt;cross post his blog&lt;/a&gt;.). At this weekend&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, he created a challenge called
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry/"&gt;Moonville&lt;/a&gt; and joined the event at the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/kennedy-space-center/"&gt;Kennedy Space Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am sitting in a room at at the Kennedy Space Center for the
International Space Apps Challenge.  It is late at night, I’m very
tired, and there are eight other people in the room:  all much younger
than me, all college students, all writing software for a game called
“&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry/" title="Bootstrapping of Space Industry | International Space Apps Challenge"&gt;Moonville&lt;/a&gt;“.  It will be a strategy game where the players simulate
the beginnings of industry in the solar system.  I submitted the
Moonville topic to the Space Apps Challenge so that eventually people
will play the game and through the game develop a winning strategy that
we can use to actually start industry in space.  It’s an exercise of
double-nested crowdsourcing.  The Space Apps Challenge is crowdsourcing
the writing of the game, so the game can crowdsource the development of
the strategy for space industry.  I’m amazed how much these students
have gotten done already, just sitting here in a room by themselves with
their laptops, a wifi, and this older guy (me) answering a few
questions.  They started entirely from scratch before dinner.  They plan
to be done by lunchtime tomorrow.  I didn’t know this was even&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![Laptop computer and engineering journal on solar system&amp;nbsp;colonization][]][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing a Moonville game to help colonize the solar&amp;nbsp;system&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few minutes ago they were taking a pizza break, and I told them that
the fate of humanity very well could depend on space hackers.  I asked,
what if the governments of the world don’t prioritize space highly
enough to get lunar industry started?  What if the commercial space
companies don’t find enough investors to fund more than their immediate
business plans and so are unable to truly colonize space?  Who then will
take humanity beyond this planet?  I’m thinking it will have to be the
private citizens of the world, space hackers like these young people. 
Individually, they may not have billions of dollars like the private
investors, or trillions of dollars like the governments of the world,
but collectively they have much, much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, there are seven billion of us here on planet Earth, so what
if just &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; billion of us paid one dollar a year for ten years into
this future in space?  That would amount to &lt;em&gt;forty billion dollars&lt;/em&gt;. 
That should be enough to get the job done.  Just one dollar a year. 
Surely we can do&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we might not convince four billion people to participate.  Too many
people don’t understand that a higher level of civilization is really
possible.  It seems too much like science fiction and so they don’t want
to throw away their dollar.  So here is another idea.  How about if just
the space enthusiasts of the world do it?  We have something more
valuable than cash, after all.  We have our abilities and our time.  We
could start developing the relevant technologies in our garages.  Some
of us could build lunar soil-mining robots.  (There are already hundreds
of people building robots in their garages for competitions and for
fun.)  Other enthusiasts could develop soil-to-metal refineries in
the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" title="Wikipedia article"&gt;Hackerspaces&lt;/a&gt; that are popping up all over the world.  Others
could adapt 3D printers for use with lunar-derived feedstock.  Still
others could write software to teleoperate this equipment.  How about if
we agree to build these things for a few years and then bring it
together to a volcano or to a desert location for a full-up,
lunar-analog field test?  We could demonstrate the equipment functioning
like it would on the Moon, robots building robots from nothing but the
soil and some ice and the sunlight as inputs.  (We could add some carbon
dioxide and ammonia to the water ice to better simulate the chemistry of
lunar ice.)  It would certainly be a grand party, as well as a great
field test!  You could count me&amp;nbsp;in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how about if we do this every other year for a decade or two,
improving our technologies until we have engineered an entire set of
hardware that can build a copy of itself?  It would be like the &lt;a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set" title="Global Village Construction Set"&gt;Global
Village Construction Set&lt;/a&gt;, but designed for the Moon.  It would be a
tangible demonstration that self-sufficient space industry is now
possible, that humanity can master the solar system and
possess &lt;a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/the-space-resource-revolution/" title="The Space Resource Revolution"&gt;billions of times greater capacity to do things&lt;/a&gt; than we can
here on planet Earth.  It would demonstrate the imminence of &lt;a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/the-big-idea-behind-space-industry/" title="The Big Idea Behind Space Industry"&gt;human
civilization at a truly higher level&lt;/a&gt; and the possibility to solve the
big global problems including pollution, poverty, and resource
depletion.  It would give hope and excitement to the next generation of
youth.  It would enable us to do great things on Earth, in our solar
system, and in the galaxy.  If we do this — in our spare time in our
garages — how could the politicians and the corporate financiers of the
world fail then to pay the last bit of cost in sending it to the&amp;nbsp;Moon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight space hackers busily writing software here where I sit are by
no means alone in the International Space Apps Challenge.  Over &lt;em&gt;eight
thousand &lt;/em&gt;space enthusiasts are participating in this event tonight. 
Some are in other rooms of this building, working on more of the 52
challenges besides Moonville.  And participants are all over the world,
including the 83 official event locations in places like Tokyo, Manila,
Abu Dhabi, Managua, Nairobi, New York — cities in 44 countries on&lt;em&gt; all
seven continents&lt;/em&gt;.  Eleven of the locations are completely “sold out”
with no room for more participants.  According to &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/04/19/worlds-largest-hackathon/" title="World's Largest Hackathon"&gt;the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;,
those are in Adelaide, Bangalore, Bogota, Guatemala City, London,
Monterrey, Recife, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Santa Marta, Santiago and
Toronto.  Space enthusiasm is not limited to the countries that are
already flying in space!  It is a global phenomenon.  The young people
that I am watching in this room are right now collaborating with others
in Ecuador.  Meanwhile, I’m answering Moonville questions from Lieden,
emailing participants in Rome, waiting for the 2:30 a.m. Google Hangout
with Jakarta, typing this blog post, and reflecting on how the fate of
humanity might depend on young space hackers like&amp;nbsp;these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you know what?  I’m feeling pretty good about&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see the projects developed for the Moonville challenge at Space
Apps 2013 &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry/#projects"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The note sent by a Canadian fifth grader who wanted to help on the Lego
Rover project. &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I am in grade 5, I would like to join your group as I
am very good at lego, Ican brainstorm quickly and nicely, and I am aa

&lt;p&gt;A team here in &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/singapore/"&gt;Singapore&lt;/a&gt; who considered all the offered
challenges&amp;#8230; but then turned around and said, what if we didn&amp;#8217;t want to
just do any of those things, and we wanted to think about how all this
data relates and how real people see it? Then they started to draw out
data overlaps on the white boards, really thoughtful about why this
stuff &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIGBukIr0hc&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;intro video&lt;/a&gt; by the leads of &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/toulouse/"&gt;Space Apps Toulouse&lt;/a&gt;. (and their&amp;nbsp;excitement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly global collaboration. Where else are there projects on all 7
continents, from San Francisco to Cotonou, Benin, from Port-au-Prince,
Haiti to London, from Kathmandu, Nepal to Maui! I am so inspired by this
vision that is engaging major urban tech centers as well as smaller
communities without the same access or privileges&amp;#8230; drawing people from
every corner of the Earth in to be a part of humanity&amp;#8217;s future on Earth
and in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects like &lt;a href="http://mwater.co/"&gt;mWater&lt;/a&gt; that epitomize the possibilities of space apps

Whether you&amp;#8217;re a scientist, a software developer, an educator, a
student, a maker, or just a space geek, we hope you enjoy building
innovative solutions at this year&amp;#8217;s International Space Apps Challenge. 
Collaboration - both locally and globaly - is the core of this event. 
Ask for help, take risks, and try something new!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="magicdomid496"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="magicdomid561"&gt;

&amp;#8230;and when it all starts to come together, make it official and submit
your project!  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

1.  To enter a project you need a name, a description, and a license
    that you release the work under, so be prepared for that.
2.  Once you enter a project, you can come back and edit it as often as
    you like.
3.  Make sure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of your teammates get entered in. This is important in
    the cases when awards are given, or folks are otherwise recognized.

Now get this &amp;#8220;paperwork&amp;#8221; done and go back to the fun stuff &amp;#8212; but
remember: if you don&amp;#8217;t enter it as a project, it didn&amp;#8217;t happen at Space
Apps!!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will judging&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will there be&amp;nbsp;awards?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me first emphasize one *very* important point - the International
Space Apps Challenge is not about competition, it&amp;#8217;s about collaboration.
It takes many nations working together to build the space station and
keep a human presence in space – and it will take many nations working
together to go further and explore beyond. As one local lead noted,
&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not about the awards - it&amp;#8217;s about being part of something
important. We have the skills and we want to share&amp;nbsp;them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, we anticipate amazing results from this weekend and we
want to honor exceptional work and the teams who performed it. So here
is the&amp;nbsp;plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;Judging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be considered for judging, you must register at
spaceappschallenge.org and submit a project by the end of the two-day
local event. Remember that the most vital consideration at this point is
documenting your work well on spaceappschallenge.org and ensure that it
has as much information as possible, including code repositories and all
participating team members.  If you developed software, you must submit
a link to your code to be included in global judging or you will be&amp;nbsp;disqualified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judging will take place at every local event (including at the &amp;#8220;virtual&amp;#8221;
location), as well as at a global level. Although we provide standard
judging criteria to each local lead, the judging process at each
location is at the discretion of the local lead. In most cases, the
organizer of each event will convene a judging panel at the conclusion
of the two-day hackathon and the panel will identify the top solutions.
The local lead will then nominate two solutions for global&amp;nbsp;recognition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 168 solutions will make it to the global judging round. Each
team nominated for global recognition will be required to produce a
short 2 minute video explaining their solution and embed the video onto
their challenge page. We highly encourage you to make the video as
creative as possible. If you need a good example, check out the winners
from last year! You will have until May 1, 2013 to submit a video
describing your challenge and&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel of judges consisting of representatives from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and other
governmental and non-governmental organizations will evaluate the top
solutions nominated by the local leads and select the best in class in
the following&amp;nbsp;categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best Use of Data - The solution that best makes space data
    accessible or leverages it to a unique purpose /&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best Use of Hardware - The solution that exemplifies the most
    innovative use of&amp;nbsp;hardware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galactic Impact - The solution that has the most potential to
    significantly improve life on Earth or in the&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most Inspiring - The solution that captured our hearts and&amp;nbsp;attention.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the top four best in class awards, there will also be an
award for the solution that has the most public votes . The People&amp;#8217;s
Choice award will be determined from a public voting process facilitated
through the spaceappschallenge.org&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People’s Choice - Determined from a public voting process facilited
    through the spaceappschallenge.org&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winners will be announced on the spaceappschallenge.org and
open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; blog on May&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awards may be offered at each local event by organizations who wish to
incentivize work on their challenges or at their location. Additionally,
awards will be offered at the global&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of what might be offered at local events or by challenge&amp;nbsp;owners:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Local awards offered at various locations at the discretion of the
    local organizer. For example, the National Aerospace Training and
    Research (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt;) Center will offer personal space training flight
    suits to the top solutions at the Philadelphia&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt; will offer an open source RepRap printer, custom trophies and
    diplomas for the top solutions to the 3D Printing&amp;nbsp;Challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Kennedy Space Center will offer 5-7 launch passes for the top
    solutions to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt; sponsored challenges (Kennedy Space Center
    2040, Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Deployable
    Greenhouse). &lt;a href="http://spaceappsksc.tumblr.com/post/48201598539/kennedy-space-center-to-invite-ksc-space-apps-winners"&gt;More information&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following awards will be offered at the global level (additional
details&amp;nbsp;below):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mars"&gt;Mars Exploration Program&lt;/a&gt; will offer launch invitations to
    the upcoming &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/maven/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAVEN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launch on 18 November 2013 for the 5 best in
    class award winners (5 invitations per project, travel expenses are
    not&amp;nbsp;included)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nastarcenter.com/"&gt;National Aerospace Training and Research (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt;) Center&lt;/a&gt;will
    offer Spaceflight Training packages to the 5 best in class award&amp;nbsp;winners.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with all great events, terms and conditions will apply and additional
details* will be communicated after winners have been identified. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,
of course, reserves the right to cancel launch invitations at any time
at its own&amp;nbsp;discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Additional&amp;nbsp;Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More details are included below regarding the global awards from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Mars Exploration Program and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Mars Exploration Program
Global&amp;nbsp;Award&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mars"&gt;Mars Exploration Program&lt;/a&gt; will extend invitations for a launch
viewing opportunity to the global winners at the 2013 International
Space Apps Challenge in the following&amp;nbsp;categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best Use of&amp;nbsp;Data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best Use of&amp;nbsp;Hardware&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most&amp;nbsp;Inspiring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Galactic&amp;nbsp;Impact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People’s&amp;nbsp;Choice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the five best in class winning teams will receive invitations to
the Kennedy Space Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;) to view the &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/maven/"&gt;Mars Atmosphere and Volatile
Evolution Mission (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAVEN&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; launch. Each team can designate up to
5 team members to receive launch invitations as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; invited guest.
The invitation is for those team members plus one additional guest each
and is non-transferrable. The invitations are available for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.
&lt;/span&gt;citizens as well as non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; citizens; all non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; citizens must be
approved by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; security 45 days prior to the launch. All guests will
be responsible for their own transportation and any costs incurred to
attend the launch&amp;nbsp;viewing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The teams will also have an opportunity to meet with Mars Exploration
Program and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAVEN&lt;/span&gt; (@MAVEN2Mars) team members. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAVEN&lt;/span&gt; mission will
explore the planet’s upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with
the sun and solar wind. Scientists will use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAVEN&lt;/span&gt; data to determine the
role that loss of volatile compounds—such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and water—from the Mars atmosphere to space has played through
time, giving insight into the history of Mars atmosphere and climate,
liquid water, and planetary&amp;nbsp;habitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team must designate the five team members within 30 days after the
global winners have been announced. All team members must be listed on
the submitted solution on spaceappschallenge.org. The winning solutions
are expected to be announced on May&amp;nbsp;22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terms and conditions will apply; additional details will be communicated
after winners have been identified. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; reserves the right to cancel
this invitation at any time at its own&amp;nbsp;discretion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;2. National Aerospace Training
and Research (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt;) Center&amp;nbsp;Award&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nastarcenter.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt; Center&lt;/a&gt; is the premier &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAA&lt;/span&gt; approved commercial aviation and space
training, research, and educational center located just outside
Philadelphia, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PA&lt;/span&gt;; and is both a local and global supporter of the 2013
International Space Apps Challenge. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt; Center will award each of the
five solution team winners a fully paid Introduction to Spaceflight
Training Course where participants will experience firsthand what it is
like to be an Astronaut for a day. The Introduction to Space course
(valued at \$500) teaches commercial spaceflight training tips,
techniques, and applications to interested and future commercial
astronaut candidates, and culminates in an “out-of-this world” full
spaceflight mission launch to reentry simulation (up to 3Gs!) using the
world’s most high performance spaceflight simulator, the Phoenix
Centrifuge. For more information, visit www.nastarcenter.com or check
out the online&amp;nbsp;brochure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award is good for one person and is valid for one year from date of
issue (see available program dates on www.nastarcenter.com). The award
is transferable to another person, but cannot be applied toward another
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt; Center program. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt; Center programs are available to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.
&lt;/span&gt;citizens and non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; citizens. All guests will be responsible for their
own transportation and any costs incurred to attend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt; Center&amp;nbsp;training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASTAR&lt;/span&gt; Center programs is for participants 18 years
and over. The team members must be listed on the submitted solution on

they will be a key piece of our Space Apps collaboration strategy. Some
hangouts will be pre-planned (like the ones you see below) - some will
happen more serendipitously as collaborations come together. Some
projects have already done introductory Hangouts to introduce their
efforts, like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=b91CcuttprY"&gt;openROV&lt;/a&gt;.  However they happen, we definitely need your

bring?  Do you want to study Earth protection by planning a mission to a
near-Earth asteroid?  Do you want to place a telescope in an orbit that
is always looking outwards from the Earth and Sun?  The General Mission
Analysis Tool (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;) is an open-source space mission design tool to help
you answer these and many other space flight challenges.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; is
developed by a team of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, private industry, and public and private
contributors.  It is used for real-world engineering studies, as a tool
for education and public engagement, and (after completion of final
acceptance testing in Sept. 2013) to fly operational spacecraft.  In
addition,  we are proud to announce a formal partnership between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
and the Korean Aerospace Research Institute (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KARI&lt;/span&gt;) to co-develop &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;.
You can download &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; here: &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/files/GMAT/GMAT-R2013a/gmat-winInstaller-i586-R2013a.exe/download"&gt;Windows Installer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/files/GMAT/GMAT-R2013a/gmat-src-R2013a.zip/download"&gt;Source Code&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; R2013a is the first official, production-quality release of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;.
 It is rigorously tested with nearly 11000 automated scripts tests
executed nightly and over 2400 automated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; tests executed weekly.
  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; has already been used to support the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCROSS&lt;/span&gt; (Lunar Crater
Observation and Sensing Satellite), &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARTEMIS&lt;/span&gt; (Acceleration, Reconnection,
Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun) ,
 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LRO&lt;/span&gt; (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter),  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt; (Magnetospheric Multiscale
Mission),  and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSIRIS&lt;/span&gt;-REx (Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource
Identification Security Regolith Explorer) missions and numerous mission&amp;nbsp;concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few of the changes and improvements in&amp;nbsp;R2013a:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;580 pages of quality end user documentation in &lt;a href="http://gmat.sourceforge.net/docs/R2013a/html/index.html"&gt;html&lt;/a&gt;  and

technologists and scientists at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; came together to write a &lt;a href="http://www.opennasa.com/wp-content/documents/PE_Recommendations.pdf"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; link) about the role of “&lt;em&gt;participatory exploration&lt;/em&gt;”. Our goal was
to influence &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; senior leadership to adopt a more participatory,
collaborative and transparent approach to the way government does
business, and to proactively engage citizens to help address the many
challenges facing the Agency. We were young, passionate and convinced
that if the space agency we loved truly wanted to remain relevant to the
world around us, we had to start thinking about things&amp;nbsp;differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that paper we made many great points that still resonate with me
today. Here are a few that stand&amp;nbsp;out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participatory exploration allows citizens from outside the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
    workforce, as well as within, to contribute in meaningful ways to
    their space&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participatory exploration creates a mechanism for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to engage
    non-traditional audiences and to leverage the diversity and volume
    of this talent in tangible and meaningful&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participatory exploration is critical for sourcing new ideas,
    solving difficult problems, and executing the Agency’s mission more&amp;nbsp;efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborative web technologies can enhance participatory exploration
    initiatives by scaling participation and focusing the development of
    solutions on relevant real world&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s public image, and its ability to return value to taxpayers,
    would benefit immensely from leveraging user-generated content,
    fostering online collaboration, and publishing content consistently
    and&amp;nbsp;openly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participatory exploration can help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; address some of its most
    pressing challenges, including the changing demographics of the
    workforce, the effects of globalization, the need to keep pace with
    accelerating technological innovations, flagging public interest in
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s work, and the need to accomplish an increasingly audacious
    mission with increasingly limited&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of participatory exploration is the basic assumption that
to truly accomplish the impossible task &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is given, we have to
develop new ways to enlist citizens everywhere to contribute their time,
talent and creativity to help us solve the grand challenges of our time.
This is especially true in times of shrinking budgets, constrained
resources and increasing demands for a more open and transparent&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years ago we could have never predicted how much the world would
change in such a short amount of time. Of the 16 co-authors, only 5 work
still at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; today. The idea of instituting an office for citizen
engagement or participatory exploration at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, as recommended in the
paper, was born and then died almost immediately on the vine. Yet, there
has been some forward progress. There still exists a core group at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
who hold firmly to the goal of opening up the space program to everyone.
We press forward with a deep conviction that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; must innovate on how
we innovate and focus on developing technologies that advance humanity
into space while more directly involving citizens in developing the
solutions. We stubbornly believe that participatory exploration
initiatives are invaluable to our future – a future that will be defined
by the hackers, engineers, technologists, scientists, designers,
artists, educators, and entrepreneurs that will create&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not only about inspiring the next generation of explorers, its
about inspiring today’s scientists and engineers as well – all those
brilliant rocket scientists who temporarily put their dream to work for
the space program on hold for whatever reason and are ready and willing
to contribute if someone would just ask&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how best to engage as many
people as possible in space exploration and in just 4 days, we will hold
our largest experiment in participatory exploration ever. This weekend,
more then 6,000 people and 330 organizations from around the world will
come together in 83 cities across 42 countries, as well as online, to
engage directly in their space program through the International Space
Apps Challenge. The event – &lt;em&gt;which will literally be the largest
hackathon ever attempted&lt;/em&gt; - is the culmination of months of planning,
years of experimentation and thousands and thousands of hours of hard
work by hundreds of people across the globe who share in the excitement
of building our collective future. It is a shining example that
participatory exploration is not only alive and well at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, but
evolving based on your direct contributions and&amp;nbsp;feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our space program, more then ever, requires the active engagement of the
public to co-create our future. Thank you to all of you who are so
selflessly contributing your time, energy and talents and working with
others to develop new solutions to our toughest challenges Thank you to
those of you who will work with others to hack, build, invent, and remix
data, software and hardware all in the name of creating new technology
to improve life on Earth and life in space. This weekend will
demonstrate the true potential of participatory exploration and what can
happen when a government agency like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; takes a chance on engaging the
untapped, unexpected, and uncharted know-how of thousands of passionate
citizens around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Be a Hardware Hero</title><link href="/be-a-hardware-hero" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-15T14:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Chris Gerty</name></author><id>tag:,2013-04-15:be-a-hardware-hero</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend at the International Space Apps Challenge, you can be a
hero in many ways.  But let’s focus on the hardware hero for a moment.
 They’re the ones who seem to have that exact adapter you need to charge
your phone or laptop when you’re at 2% power.  They live by the belief
that if you can’t open it, you don’t really own it. Also, and most
importantly for this weekend, they approach every problem with a keen
eye for how the digital world meets the physical&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you be a hardware&amp;nbsp;hero?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Do your homework.&lt;/em&gt;  No, I’m not talking about memorizing
periodic tables and melting points of steel alloys. Rather, browse the
latest hardware-related blogs, see what people are making out of their
Arduino or Raspberry Pi.  Then, after browsing through the Space Apps
Challenges, try a simple project or two this week, brainstorming ways
that a solution could fit into the real world using open hardware.  Be
the expert everyone’s looking for when it’s time to take a software
solution to the next level and make those bits and bytes interact with
molecules and&amp;nbsp;atoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Bring your hardware.&lt;/em&gt;  The hardware hero is always
prepared when ‘bits’ need to meet up with ‘atoms’.  So bring your
breadboard and batteries.  Show up to the #spaceapps venue with a huge
backback - maybe even a roller suitcase full of gadgets and parts ready
for tinkering.  You never know that sensor or display that you’re going
to need to being that great idea to&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;em&gt;Share your skills.&lt;/em&gt;  Not only is teaching the best way to
learn, but when someone is learning how to make and use a piece of
hardware, they free themselves from how it works inside, and focus on
what it does for the user.  The most important thing you could do while
designing a hardware solution is put it in front of someone who doesn’t
know how it works. Teach them how to use it and the resulting solution
will be better, and just maybe - you will have created another hardware
hero in the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remember heros - with great power comes great responsibility - now go

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Well, that&amp;#8217;s just great,&amp;#8221; I say to myself before making a quick edit
and switching over to my command line&amp;nbsp;prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;commit&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Please let it work this time&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fab&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;deploy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;development&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I refresh my browser and see an image of the blue marble with 75
colorful icons and a slowly moving International Space Station sliding
across the screen. Success. Issue ticket&amp;nbsp;closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s been the story of my life, and the lives of the rest of the team
behind &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;spaceappschallenge.org&lt;/a&gt;, over the past few weeks as we
prepared the site to go live, first as a soft launch on March 3rd, and
later as a full rollout last week. We&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time on the site
and are really proud of the&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, I wrote up a brief overview of the platform we created, and I
wanted to do same for our 2013 site. We&amp;#8217;ve rewritten the code from the
ground up to incorporate a lot of the things we wanted to do in 2012 but
weren&amp;#8217;t able to. The site incorporates some of the latest techniques and
methodologies in web development, and it&amp;#8217;s our hope that it can serve as
a model for how government websites can be built in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methodology&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of responsive and adaptive design. Responsive design is
the concept of making content flexible to the device on which it is
viewed - whether that be on a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, or
any other medium. With 50% of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; web traffic slated to be mobile in the
next few years, and our huge focus on countries where mobile device
deployments far outpace traditional internet access, this was critical.
Our 2012 website was responsive as well (utilizing the Skeleton
framework), but we took it one step further this year by making it
&lt;em&gt;mobile first&lt;/em&gt;. With mobile first design, we approached the site with a
very different mindset. While traditionally, you would design your
website for the desktop and then scale down to mobile, with mobile first
you design for mobile and then scale up to desktop. For us, this had a
few notable&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compatibility&lt;br /&gt;
    Rather than try and fight browsers and pull content out that
    doesn&amp;#8217;t scale or doesn&amp;#8217;t work, we&amp;#8217;re able to progressively enhance
    and build on top of a base. This is really important for things like
    Internet Explorer 8 compatibility - rather than things just not
    working we&amp;#8217;re able to serve a slightly less nice looking experience
    but ultimately still deliver the&amp;nbsp;content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ease of Building&lt;br /&gt;
    It&amp;#8217;s a lot easier to add things on top rather than pull things out.
    Rather than having to write super specific &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; (and probably use a
    lot of undesirable !important tags), we&amp;#8217;re able to just overwrite
    the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; we want&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information Architecture&lt;br /&gt;
    Building mobile first really forced us to reconsider the importance
    of a lot of our content. You&amp;#8217;ll notice the front page, for instance,
    has a lot less content than this year. We also concentrated on
    trying to eliminate unneeded links, instead focusing on touch
    friendly imagery and buttons to provide an easier to navigate&amp;nbsp;interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Backend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with last year, the site is built on Django, a Python framework.
We&amp;#8217;ve found Django to be both extensible and easy to use, an important
factor considering no one on our team is a full-time developer. We have
four major components of our backend&amp;nbsp;architecture:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Challenges&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than introducing a lot of dependencies on our models as we did
last year, Space Apps 2013 focuses much more on an object-oriented
model. For future usage, it is much easier to move components of the
above four items to other projects or to strike one from another
deployment of the&amp;nbsp;platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Frontend&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our fronted is based on Foundation Zurb, a great framework that provides
a lot of baseline &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and Javascript to jumpstart web projects. We used
a few tools pretty extensively in our&amp;nbsp;development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SASS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SASS&lt;/span&gt; is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; preprocessor that offers a lot of enhancements over plain
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, such as nested rules, variables, and mixing to quicken&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Leaflet, OpenStreetMaps, &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Mapquest Open&amp;nbsp;Maps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaflet powers all of the mapping solutions on the site. We use a
combination of OpenStreetMaps and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Satellite imagery tiles served by
Mapquest&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDN&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isotope&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Isotope to power some of the sorting and filtering for&amp;nbsp;Challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Wysihtml5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wysihtml5 powers all of our backend &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WYSIWYG&lt;/span&gt; inline&amp;nbsp;editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Typekit&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Typekit to serve our web&amp;nbsp;fonts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Disqus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disqus powers our commenting system on challenges and projects. We&amp;#8217;ve
used their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSO&lt;/span&gt; option so that users can use the same identity between&amp;nbsp;platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hackpad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Hackpad&amp;#8217;s new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to offer collaboration tools for challenges and&amp;nbsp;projects&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Cloudflare to help us more efficiently serve content around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Google&amp;nbsp;Apps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We use Google Apps to power some internal mailing&amp;nbsp;lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the Space Apps website is much more than just a platform for us
to offer our event on - it&amp;#8217;s a testbed for some of the latest web
technologies to be played around with. My hope is that others both
inside and outside government can fork our code, learn from our
experiences, and improve on our&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also view the Space Apps website as a work in progress - we hope that
citizens like yourself can help us make it even better than it already
is. If you see a bug, something that can be improved, or anything else
you think we should know about, drop us a line in the comments below.
We&amp;#8217;d love to hear from&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="spaceapps"></category><category term="spaceappschallenge"></category><category term="spaceappschallenge.org"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>Virtual Participation for #SpaceApps 2013</title><link href="/virtual-participation-for-spaceapps-2013" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-13T17:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-04-13:virtual-participation-for-spaceapps-2013</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;Squares have been appearing on the world map&lt;/a&gt; for the past several
months…  there are now so many that some are buried underneath others!
Right now we know of 83 local events planned in 44 countries –
connections on all 7 continents and in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: &lt;em&gt;what if you live somewhere where you can’t join a
local event?&lt;/em&gt; Whether that’s Alaska, Russia, the bottom of the Atlantic
or on the International Space Station, we are committed to engaging the
participation of anyone and everyone who wants to be a part of
addressing exploration challenges. Fortunately, with the aid of
technology, that’s possible. Your city may not have an event this year –
but you can “put it on the map” by volunteering your skills and&amp;nbsp;perspectives!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what do virtual participants need to know for Space&amp;nbsp;Apps? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before the&amp;nbsp;Event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check out &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;challenge pages&lt;/a&gt; and figure out what you want to work
    on. You can ask questions and leave comments on the hackpads
    associated with each challenge. (There&amp;#8217;s a blue button on the page
    to get to the hackpad.) Leave a note with your skills and how people
    can contact&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invite your friends and colleagues! While we would love to connect
    you with collaborators in other cities, you certainly can bring your
    own collaborators with&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connect up with the Virtual Coordinator, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wmburke"&gt;Wayne Burke&lt;/a&gt;! He’s ready
    to help match you with project teams and answer your&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the&amp;nbsp;Event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/virtual/"&gt;Virtual Location page&lt;/a&gt; will be your home base – Wayne will be
    keeping it up to date with contact information, news and whatever
    information you need to&amp;nbsp;know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a project page on spaceappschallenge.org and list your
    collaborators. This will be where you ultimately submit your work&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out with your team how you want to communicate and what tools
    will work for you.  The key to successful virtual participation is
    solid communication – and so we want to be sure that everyone is
    getting the information they&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stay connected with the global event from your location! Watch the
    intro video when it gets posted and stay tuned to the dashboard for
    timeline, Ustream updates, Twitter&amp;nbsp;connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After the&amp;nbsp;Event:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spaceapps"&gt;Watch online for updates&lt;/a&gt; on judging of virtual projects and
    nominations for global&amp;nbsp;judging!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge is fundamentally about
collaboration. It takes many nations working together to build the space
station and keep a human presence in space – and it will take many
nations working together to go further and explore beyond. Come be a
part of helping to make that&amp;nbsp;happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/register/"&gt;Sign up here&lt;/a&gt; to participate virtually in the International Space
Apps Challenge – and we’ll “see” you next&amp;nbsp;weekend!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Change the world with 5 simple steps</title><link href="/change-the-world-with-5-simple-steps-2" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-04-12T23:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brenda Velasquez</name></author><id>tag:,2013-04-12:change-the-world-with-5-simple-steps-2</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Crafting our world sounds like a lot of hard work and nearly impossible
for one person. Well, guess what? The 2^nd^ round of International Space
Apps Challenge is here to give you the opportunity to make a difference
in your community and around the world. By working together with
similarly concerned citizens from across the globe you can make a
difference. Here are just a few ways you can participate and help make
this event&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Register for a location, and tell everyone that you&amp;#8217;re participating.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Sing up to attend one of our &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/locations/"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; near you, or choose to join
our largest location as a virtual participant. Registration is free and
open to anyone  who is willing to share their skills and perspective
with other teams around the world. It is very important to register
within the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/locations/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; in order to be considered for global
judging. Share this opportunity with your peers before and during the
event. We cannot do this alone; enlist anyone with a passion. We
currently have 5,646 registered participants  and&amp;nbsp;growing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pick a challenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Having the freedom to choose your own project out of our 50
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; can be overwhelming. Picking and attacking a challenge
that interests &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; is usually the best &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/04/08/fifty-challenges-where-do-i-start/"&gt;starting point&lt;/a&gt;. But don’t
stop there,  start commenting your questions or ideas on our challenge&amp;nbsp;page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose a team or make a team.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want you to be involved physically and virtually. Once you pick the
challenges you&amp;#8217;re most curious about, seek out teams at physical
locations, seek out teams of virtual participants, or become a floater
by working with various teams and contributing  ideas to many challenges
-whatever you feel most comfortable with. You could even start
strategizing before the event by forming your own group of colleagues,
but just remember we’re all one big team. Branching out and
communicating with all the other paticipants, physically and virtually,
is expected; thousands of people have set aside 48 hours to work with
you. The possibilities are&amp;nbsp;endless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find a solution in your open source environment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Weare excited to see what happens when people with diverse skill sets
come together to work for a common goal. Use earth and space data to
make awesomeness aka solution(s). The solutions can range from
software/hardware to videos/art and more.  Submit your solution(s) to be
judged locally and possibly&amp;nbsp;internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Carry on with the challenge even after the event!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;International Space Apps Challenge is only the beginning. Many of the
challenges+solutions outlive the hackathon to further space exploration.
Its been done &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/06/14/open-hardware-exploration-at-neemo16/"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; and it can be done&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;

shares here about how physical and virtual participants can get started
with the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;50 carefully curated challenges&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming global&amp;nbsp;Challenge!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the things we are most proud of with the 2013 International Space
Apps Challenge is the wealth high &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;quality problem definitions&lt;/a&gt; that we have cultivated with dozens of
partners from inside and outside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. But that leave us with an
additional challenge on top of it all - where does one even&amp;nbsp;start?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with what interests &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;. We believe there is something for
everyone in this challenge set, whether you are a &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/backyard-poultry-farmer"&gt;backyard farmer&lt;/a&gt;, a
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/no-delays-air-traffic-management"&gt;future air traffic controller&lt;/a&gt;, or future &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry"&gt;space-faring
entrepreneur&lt;/a&gt;. No matter what your skillset is or your weekend goals
are, you cannot go wrong by working with a topic that interests you.
Most of these challenges have enough breadth do them that you can
identify a piece that is interesting to you regardless of your
background. See a challenge where you like the topic but you&amp;#8217;re not
quite sure how you would fit in? Leave a comment for others to see! And
when you arrive at your local event, identify others who might be
interested in that&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reviewing a challenge that might interest you, think about how
you&amp;#8217;d like to spend your weekend. Do you like being told exactly what
needs to get done, down to the most comprehensive detail so you can
ensure maximum impact? We have &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/earth-from-space/"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/scistarter-citizen-science/"&gt;for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/soil-testing-kit/"&gt;you&lt;/a&gt;. Your
skills added to a well-defined project with clear needs can greatly
increase the likelihood that your work will have a direct impact on our
world. Do you like a big, open-ended challenge that lets you flex your
creative muscle for a solution that reaches for the stars? We have
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/space-station-benefits-to-humanity/"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/why-we-explore/"&gt;challenges&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/we-love-data/"&gt;too&lt;/a&gt;. The open-ended challenges can be
wonderful learning experiences and creative exercises and it is from
those challenges that we often see the biggest game-changers that we
could never have predicted! That is the wonderful value of massive
collaboration around the globe with like-minded scientists, hackers and&amp;nbsp;innovators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll also notice that there are four challenge categories: Software,
Hardware, Citizen Science, and Data Visualization. This is a good
initial starting point, but don&amp;#8217;t be fooled by these tags! A &amp;#8220;hardware&amp;#8221;
challenge may have software components. A &amp;#8220;software&amp;#8221; challenge may have
a data visualization&amp;nbsp;sub-challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s review some of the take-away points here on how to&amp;nbsp;engage:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on topics that interest you&amp;nbsp;personally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out if you want to work on highly defined challenges, or ones
    that are more&amp;nbsp;open-ended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Utilize the four categories to help narrow down options, but don&amp;#8217;t
    be constrained by&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Think creatively about how your skills and interests can be applied
    to the problems that seem most appealing to&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Discuss with your peers - both virtually and at events - about how
    you can collaborate together on solving these&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#8217;t wait to see what you come up&amp;nbsp;with!  &lt;/p&gt;

team saw the &lt;a href="http://natronics.github.com/ISS-photo-locations/"&gt;latest project&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/natronics"&gt;Nate Bergey&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to get
him to share it directly with you. This project exemplifies why we share
our &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/"&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt; with the public as well as the kind of inspiration
we&amp;#8217;re anticipating at the upcoming &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. Hopefully
this will be the first in a long series of posts by Nate and other
innovators who are using space data to create great&amp;nbsp;things. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve always been fascinated with space. I’ve done plenty of &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/natronics/5310760993/"&gt;looking up
at the skies&lt;/a&gt; throughout my life, wondering what I would see if I were
up there looking back down&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data every day, even though I don’t work for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.  They have
many detailed and rich datasets available for reading/viewing by the
general public. The problem though is that they are often published in
archaic formats buried under hard to use interfaces. But with a little
ingenuity, anyone can get their hands on amazing data about the universe
we live&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I love the photographs that are being downloaded from the
International Space Station’s cameras. Each one inspires me to dream of
floating high above our blue planet. Sometimes, I wonder, what do the
astronauts mostly take pictures of? In order to find out, I had to get
some&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Image Science &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Analysis Laboratory, at Johnson Space Center in
Houston, Texas, maintains a [giant database of all the photographs
astronauts have ever taken in space][].  Luckily, they also have a
&lt;a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov/sseop/mrf.htm"&gt;database search page&lt;/a&gt; that allows you to ask for information about
photos from particular missions, and features all kinds of&amp;nbsp;metadata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s possible to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping"&gt;screen scrape&lt;/a&gt; the search result pages, using
popular programing languages like python and tools like &lt;a href="http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/"&gt;Beautiful
Soup&lt;/a&gt;, creating your personal mini database of the data you care
about. In my case, it was the approximate latitude and longitude of the
photos taken from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;, or at the very least, the position of the
station when the photo was&amp;nbsp;taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote some python scripts to do this for me a few pages at a time,
and I ended up with the location of 1,129,177 photos!&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 dir="ltr"&gt;Visualization&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step was to put the data on a map. To do this, I decided to
draw each photo as a single pixel on a blank image. This is actually
really easy in python using&amp;nbsp;cairo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result is a giant map of Earth, based only on images from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/all_iss.preview.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="All ISS" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/all_iss.preview.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the photos are taken of land masses. Coastlines, islands and
cities seem to be popular targets. So much, that it’s possible to
identify outline of continents. This makes sense, photos of clouds over
an otherwise blank ocean get old after a while. I’m sure every astronaut
has taken at least one photograph of the town they grew up&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s divide up the dots by mission. Is there any pattern? Here I
draw each mission in a different&amp;nbsp;color:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/all_iss_missions.preview.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="All ISS Missions" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/all_iss_missions.preview.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map is dominated by purple, light blue, and green with some yellow.
Also notice that the purple dots make almost uninterrupted orbit lines
while most of the other dots seem to fill in randomly. This is because
during Expedition 30/31 &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/61083440"&gt;Don Pettit took dozens of amazing time lapse
sequences&lt;/a&gt; consisting of hundreds of images taken continuously as the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; orbited. In fact he’s single-handedly responsible for almost half
the images taken on&amp;nbsp;orbit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One more thing we can do is add a map underneath to see exactly how the
photos line&amp;nbsp;up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/all_iss_missions_map.preview.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="All ISS Missions by Map" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/all_iss_missions_map.preview.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; stays between about 50° and -50° latitude as it
orbits the Earth The &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_inclination"&gt;inclination&lt;/a&gt; of the orbit of the station is in
fact&amp;nbsp;51.6°.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since it’s hard to see the overlapped colors in the above image here is
a collection maps with the photos from each mission mapped&amp;nbsp;separately:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/small_mult.preview.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Multiple Maps" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/small_mult.preview.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just some of the data that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has to offer. If you’re
interested in getting involved in things like this I suggest taking a
look at &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also &lt;a href="http://natronics.github.com/ISS-photo-locations/"&gt;download the data I scraped from my github page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

an effort to create stronger and more refined challenges. The first
featured problem set was offered by the Peace Corps as part of it&amp;#8217;s
&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Innovation Challenge&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; The Peace Corps Innovation Challenge is a
worldwide collaboration to develop innovative solutions for the real
challenges faced by people throughout the developing world as identified
and articulated by Peace Corps Volunteers. Today they announced that
they will be doing a second Innovation Challenge and are seeking
submissions of relevant problems through their &lt;a href="http://innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. The
submitted problems statements will then be reviewed and voted on by
current and returned volunteers, Peace Corps staff, technology experts
and entrepreneurs. The best problems will be offered at a hackathon in
June 2013. Below is their press release, which describes one of the top
solutions from the first Innovation Challenge - a Mobile Language
Application developed by Zambian software developers that translates
English words and phrases into one of seven languages spoken in Zambia.
The app, Bantu Babel, is now available for Android compatible devices in
the Google Play store.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Innovation Program team worked
closely with the Peace Corps on their first Innovation Challenge and
continue to exchange best practices around effective mass collaborations
like&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cross post from &lt;a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/resources/media/press/2212/"&gt;Peace Corps website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASHINGTON&lt;/span&gt;, D.C., April 1, 2013 – Peace Corps volunteers, working
closely with Zambian software developers, have developed a mobile
application that will translate English words and phrases into one of
seven languages spoken in Zambia. Bantu Babel is now available for
Android compatible devices in the Google Play&amp;nbsp;store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is intended to help Peace Corps volunteers, international aid
workers, and host country nationals communicate more effectively. The
app has two parts: a dictionary for translating individual words, and
a survival phrasebook which contains helpful terms for accommodation,
shopping, food and emergencies, among others. Bantu Babel, which can
be used as a training tool for government and aid workers or as a
supplement to formal language training, runs offline eliminating the
need for an internet&amp;nbsp;connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Peace Corps has a phenomenal language training program and to be
able to share it is both exciting and inspiring, and to be able
realize a solution in collaboration with host country nationals truly
embodies the spirit of Peace Corps&lt;/em&gt;,” said Tony Tseng, a third year
volunteer from Sacramento,&amp;nbsp;California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace Corps volunteers Tony Tseng, Melissa Stetler, and Rasa Kent
worked with developers from BongoHive, a Lusaka-based technology and
innovation hub to develop the app. BongoHive provides a place for the
local tech community to meet, swap experience, and attend training,
networking and hackathon&amp;nbsp;events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;It is my belief that Zambia, like many other developing countries,
is in a great position to leapfrog over traditional technology
infrastructures. Almost all Zambians own a cell phone and the market
for mobile applications is growing. To be able to utilize the mobile
phones already in use is a new approach to development that has proven
to be successful in other countries across Africa&lt;/em&gt;,” said&amp;nbsp;Tseng.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The framework for the program was developed during a two-day
“hackathon” in December 2012 in Lusaka, part of the Random Hacks of
Kindness (RHoK) global hackathon that included participants in 32
cities and 16 different countries. RHoK’s mission is to create a
self-sustaining global community of innovators building practical open
technology for a better world, and to ensure their work creates impact
in&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peace Corps participated in this worldwide event by collecting
ideas for problems and solutions through the Peace Corps Innovation
Challenge. Peace Corps is again seeking submissions of relevant
problems through the Innovation Challenge website. Problems will be
reviewed and voted on by current and returned volunteers, Peace Corps
staff, technology experts and entrepreneurs. Once problems are
reviewed and refined, technology experts will team up to develop
solutions during the next hackathon in&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Peace Corps/Zambia: Nearly 1,435 Peace Corps volunteers have
served in Zambia since the program was established in 1993. Currently,
284 volunteers serve in Zambia. Volunteers work in the areas of
education, community development, environment, agriculture, health and
business. Volunteers are trained and work in the following languages:
Bemba, Kaonde, Lunda, Mambwe, Nyanja, Tonga and&amp;nbsp;Tumbuka.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the Peace Corps: Since President John F. Kennedy established
the Peace Corps by executive order on March 1, 1961, more than 210,000
Americans have served in 139 host countries. Today, 8,073 volunteers
are working with local communities in 76 host countries in
agriculture, community economic development, education, environment,
health and youth in development. Peace Corps volunteers must be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.
&lt;/span&gt;citizens and at least 18 years of age. Peace Corps service is a
27-month commitment and the agency’s mission is to promote world peace
and friendship and a better understanding between Americans and people
of other countries. Visit www.peacecorps.gov for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Innovation Program. This is a cross-post of the &lt;a href="http://futurethink.com/innovator-interview-nasas-nick-skytland/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; from their
website.   A longer version of this interview will be published (and
linked here) in a few&amp;nbsp;days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) How does a large organization like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; manage its innovation
process? (And more specifically, the Open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;initiative?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last century, we have relied on governments to tackle the
grand challenges of our time and to manage the innovation process
within government by themselves. For the average citizen,
participating in government was extremely limited – you could show up
to vote on election day, express your concern by protesting about a
cause, or if you really wanted to make a change, apply for a
government&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people had very little influence on how business in government
was conducted and how innovation was managed (if it was managed at
all). This severely limited not only the number of people working on
solving our nation’s toughest challenges, but also limited the
diversity in perspective contributed towards the&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, we have witnessed the emergence of technology
that is slowly starting to change the way governments approach
innovation and opening up new ways to participate directly in
government. At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we are just beginning to rethink what this means
for how we manage our innovation process. We are starting to embrace
openness as a catalyst to innovation and providing unprecedented
access to our raw data, software and technology to a wide base of
potential contributors. We are also starting to shift away from purely
competitive approaches and also embrace new paradigm shifting&amp;nbsp;collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this shift, we are starting to enable breakthroughs to
proceed at a faster rate than was possible before. We work with others
to show how they can leverage distributed collaboration to focus the
investment of thousands of individual effort hours by citizens across
the country towards constructive projects that benefit both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and
the&amp;nbsp;nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) How do you select which ideas to invest in and move forward&amp;nbsp;with?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government agencies must find groups of people, bring them together
around an issue or problem that needs to be fixed, then step out of
the way and let the collective energy of the people involved solve
problems in creative and imaginative ways that we would never have
done ourselves. It’s not just about individual participation; it’s
about mass collaboration. It’s about creating platforms that allow us
to take advantage of the exponential power of what happens when a
thousand eyes look at our toughest problems and we collectively
develop a&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to this is to build a platform for collaboration that doesn’t
prescribe our own solution and then rewards the best ideas with the
recognition they deserve. Our approach within the Open Innovation
Program has been to identify and prioritize the challenges most worth
solving, build a platform to engage a large diverse group of
participants around the challenge, incentivize them (through
collaboration) to develop a solution, and then let the best ideas rise
to the top&amp;nbsp;naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) What are some collaborations the program has facilitated that
have led to new ideas and&amp;nbsp;solutions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amazing collaboration that has come out of our work that has led to
new ideas and solutions is the &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt; project.
Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative
encompassing a core team of collaborators including &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.worldbank.org/"&gt;World
Bank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ever
expanding ecosystem of supporting organizations, and a community of
over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries collectively working to
make the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on our experience with Random Hacks of Kindness, we developed
the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; which is an international
mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over
48-hours in cities around the world. In April of 2012, we hosted the
first International Space Apps Challenge. The event embraces
collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant
open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life
on Earth and life in space. The event took place in 25 countries
around the world and resulted in over 100 solutions. It was the
largest government-led mass collaboration event to date, and a
testament to what people can accomplish together if given the
permission, opportunity, and&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event demonstrated that the creativity and innovation that used to
take place primarily behind closed doors within large institutions is
increasingly taking place by people connected together online. By
tapping into a global community of expertise, partnering with leading
researchers, scientists, technologists, academics and entrepreneurs as
well as collaborating directly with citizens and innovative
organizations on projects like Random Hacks of Kindness and the
International Space Apps Challenge, we are able to develop solutions
that we would have never came up with on our own. Solutions that may
have a lasting impacts on both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) What is the single biggest challenge to making innovation happen
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;? (And how do you overcome&amp;nbsp;them?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single biggest challenge to making innovation happen at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
simply “&lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt;.” If you want to see how innovative an organization
truly is (not just how people perceive it to be), simply take a good
hard look at its culture. To move beyond this, we must challenge
long-standing business management orthodoxies – even the cultural&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The grand challenges today are too complex – the ones worth solving
will require all of us. But changing the culture of an entire
organization as big as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; seems like a nearly impossible task at
first, so you have to lead by example and start small. Innovation is
all about challenging prevailing assumptions about the way we have
done things in the past and suggesting better approaches. It’s about
staying nimble by minimizing&amp;nbsp;complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) What is your favorite innovation that has come out of the Open
Innovation&amp;nbsp;Program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite example is that of the &lt;a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/nasa-planetary-data-system-interface/solution/120"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VICAR2PNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project which helped
unlock some valuable &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; really has an unparalleled trove
of scientific and engineering data that represents an incredible asset
that we want the public to utilize. At the &lt;a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;2012 International Space
Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, we offered a challenge to improve access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
data. As it turns out, much of the image data from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s missions in
the Planetary Image Atlas was in an very outdated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VICAR&lt;/span&gt; format. As the
developers soon found out, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VICAR&lt;/span&gt; was unreadable by any existing open
source image conversion tools, so they set out to create one! They
wrote and packaged a solution called “vicar2png” so that anyone can
view, enjoy, and remix &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission image data easily by converting
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VICAR&lt;/span&gt; files to the popular &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PNG&lt;/span&gt; image format. To demonstrate the
potential of the solution (and the data), they then created movies
using PNGs from several segments of raw images from the
Cassini-Huygens mission. The solution showcased the potential of
what’s possible by making &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s data more&amp;nbsp;accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Space Industry Needs Open Standards to Thrive</title><link href="/the-space-industry-needs-open-standards-to-thrive" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-26T13:38:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-03-26:the-space-industry-needs-open-standards-to-thrive</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stephen Murphey is a [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; Space Technology Evangelist ][]researching
how the Open Source and Maker Movement will revolutionize the space
industry. The Open Innovation Program has invited him to share his
insights on open standards and their role in the aerospace industry
leading up to him sharing more during the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Standards available for everyone to use in the space industry are
the best way to reduce costs, improve safety and keeping making ground
breaking innovations. One of the best known successes in “Open Standards
for Space” are &lt;a href="http://stephenmurphey.com/what-are-cubesats/"&gt;cubesats&lt;/a&gt;, those tiny little spacecraft built on a
common platform that have become a favorite among the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt; Space&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making spacecraft Cheaper and Easier to&amp;nbsp;Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll be the first to admit that Cubesats aren’t perfect. They’re tiny,
limited in the kinds of missions they can perform (functions are
improving every day though) and getting a ride to orbit is still
prohibitively expensive and difficult. But they are an order of
magnitude cheaper and easier to design, build and launch because they
are built on Open Standards. Because anyone can build upon the platform,
thousands of people have found innovative uses for them and a few have
built companies to &lt;a href="http://stephenmurphey.com/where-to-buy-cubesat-parts/"&gt;sell the hardware&lt;/a&gt; to do so. If the Cubesat design
and remained on some engineers shelf as closely held intellectual
property, none of this would have&amp;nbsp;happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Standards also enable cost reductions through &lt;a href="http://michaelbelfiore.com/2012/11/spacecraft-mass-production.html"&gt;mass production&lt;/a&gt;
of hardware. Because we’re not “reinventing the wheel” with each new
spacecraft and instead building them based on predefined and proven
components&amp;#8230;each spacecraft is cheaper to build. Fortunately, we’re
starting to see this all across the space industry. Companies like
Sierra Nevada, Orbital Sciences and Lockheed Martin are building
spacecraft based on common designs. Unfortunately, those designs are
usually based on proprietary knowledge and are not shared with the wider
community. This does make business sense, after all why would a company
willingly share knowledge they’ve spent years and millions of dollars&amp;nbsp;creating?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because it will make those designs better while growing the&amp;nbsp;industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Standards Improve&amp;nbsp;Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way. Which product is more likely to remain competitive
and low cost? A design that is supported and tested by thousands of
experts or a design that is supported by a few dozen (all of whom are on
the&amp;nbsp;payroll)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best known examples is the software industry. Many software
startups were built on what is referred to as “&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; stack” - Linux,
Apache, MySQL and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;. The software was free, proven and supported by a
community of tens of thousands of programmers that were improving it
every day. There was no possible way a proprietary piece of software
could remain competitive and so value moved higher up the foodchain.
Instead of making money building database software, a company had to
make something valuable with database software. Because companies could
focus on building amazing services with the software rather than
building the infrastructure to get started, new companies were born.
Companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter and many&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Hardware is Different,&amp;nbsp;Right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you’re probably thinking that hardware is different. The
market is smaller and building stuff actually costs money, unlike
software which can be replicated for free. Then let me introduce you to
Makerbot, the company credited with ushering in the consumer 3D printer&amp;nbsp;revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Makerbot didn’t invent the 3D printer. Their first design “cupcake”
was based on RepRap, a Open Source Hardware design supported by the
community. While anyone could download the RepRap design and build their
own, it was limited to a small group of people with the skills to
actually build a printer from scratch. Makerbot modified the design to
make it easier to manufacture and use, sold it as an “easy to build” kit
and provided customer support. This opened up 3D printing to a larger
audience who were interested but couldn’t afford a commercial version or
have the skills to build one themselves. All made possible because the
initial “Open Standard” of 3D printing was made&amp;nbsp;available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Comes&amp;nbsp;Next?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I actually expect companies like Boeing to share their proprietary
designs? Nope. Instead what I think will happen is exactly what happened
with Cubesats. A small group of people will create a design and share it
because a) they can’t profit by keeping it secret and b) they want to
improve the design by getting feedback from others and don’t have the
money to improve it&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This scenario is becoming more common every day thanks to cheap
computers, design software, access to manufacturing tools (Techshop is a
great example of this) and free knowledge sharing made possible by the&amp;nbsp;Internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of all, Open Standards mean that everyone can get involved. Want to
improve the Cubesat design or make a better 3D printed rocket engine?
You don’t need to ask permission or pay someone to get&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what are you waiting&amp;nbsp;for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Kindness&lt;/a&gt;, a self-sustaining global community of innovators building
practical open technology for a better world, and committed to ensuring
their work creates impact in society. The first student-focused RHoK
community event (grades 4-8) is planned for this May, and we are excited
to explore the overlaps between mass collaborations, &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/technology-accelerators/"&gt;technology
acceleration&lt;/a&gt; and our &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/about/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; education goals&lt;/a&gt;. Event lead &lt;a href="a%20href=&amp;quot;mailto:pgans@fraserwoods.com&amp;gt;Patrice%20Gans&amp;lt;/a"&gt;Patrice
Gans&lt;/a&gt; shares below about her vision for RHoK&amp;nbsp;Jr. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of recent tragic events, it has become more important than
ever for young people to feel empowered to make a difference in their
community. With this goal in mind, Fraser Woods Montessori School in
Newtown, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; is presenting &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/event/rhok-junior"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness Junior&lt;/a&gt;. The
event, which will take place on Saturday, May 4, 2013, offers elementary
school students (4th – 8th grade) from across Connecticut the
opportunity to explore the power of computing by developing technical
solutions to practical&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness Junior (RHoKJr) will bring together technology
experts (university professors, college students, high school teachers
and students) and elementary students to create Smartphone Apps,
websites or educational games to help local&amp;nbsp;causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterned after the global event, Random Hacks of Kindness
(www.rhok.org), whose mission is to create a self-sustaining global
community of innovators building practical open technology for a better
world, and to ensure their work creates impact in society, participants
will work directly with local stake holders to create real world&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Llewellyn, from Open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, will also be on site to support the
effort. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is very excited about their participation in the first ever
RHoK Jr event. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s educational focus is on strengthening the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
future workforce, attracting and retaining students in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; disciplines
and engaging Americans in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s mission. “The best education happens
when students use their growing technical skills to help address real
problems and RHoK Jr gives us an opportunity to help further these
objectives in the context of a collaborative experience. One of these
students could be the first human to walk on Mars – we want to help
inspire them as learners, problem solvers and&amp;nbsp;explorers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following organizations have requested technical assistance and will
be presenting their requests at the May event: Newtown Trails
Commission, Newtown Kindness, Ben’s Bells, The Animal Center (of
Newtown), Autism Speaks and the American Diabetes Association (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Chapter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The vision is simple: anyone, anywhere should have the tools to change
the world at their fingertips. Acts of kindness come in all shapes and
sizes, and technology is just another avenue which needs to be&amp;nbsp;explored.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="RHoK"></category></entry><entry><title>Announcing the Challenges for the 2013 International Space Apps Challenge</title><link href="/announcing-the-challenges-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-03-18T22:37:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2013-03-18:announcing-the-challenges-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; is an international mass

encompassing a core team of collaborators including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, World Bank,
Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, an ever expanding ecosystem of
supporting organizations, and a community of over 5,500 innovators in
over 30 countries collectively working to make the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effort, which is only three years old, has resulted in 177
hackathons in 37 different countries producing thousands of solutions.
There are a number of past RHoK projects that serve as guiding examples
of what’s possible in just 48 hours, from those developed in the early
days and still in use like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHASM&lt;/span&gt;, Open Street Map Tasking Manager,
Risk-in-a-Box (now InaSAFE), First Responder and Caritas Disaster
Mapping, as well as Bushfire Connect, to more recent RHoK projects like
PhillySNAP, Sheltr, WaterVoices, AdHawk, Bring the Food, Yo! Philly
Votes, Councilmatic, FourTeachersProject and&amp;nbsp;Taarifa.&lt;/p&gt;

about his recent work with physical apps and space data. Jon runs the
&lt;a href="http://productresearch.dundee.ac.uk/"&gt;Product Design Masters&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Dundee in Scotland and
is currently researching how existing and emerging digital technology
can be harnessed using design to enable new forms of interaction and
production for the benefit of people.  Jon has contributed a number of
challenges to the International Space Apps Challenge, including the
popular “We Love Data” challenge in 2012. You can follow Jon on Twitter
at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ileddigital"&gt;@ileddigital&lt;/a&gt;. (Crosspost from Product Design Studio &lt;a href="http://productresearch.dundee.ac.uk/sxsw-2013-make-space-data-physical/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making data physical means that more people can access it in more ways.
Taking data from the screen and making it do things in the real world
dramatically increases the potential impact of this data. And as far as
being able to touch data that can never be touched, then space and time
have to be it.  Things that are far away or things that are lost in time
are two physical barriers we simply can’t cross and we want to find a
way to do&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61137346?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ff9933" height="281" width="500" allowfullscreen frameborder="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/61137346"&gt;Get Physical: Making Space Data Real On Earth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/user1789110"&gt;jon rogers&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, one of the most dramatic pieces of data I have come across are
the chunks of wall that are missing from the Victoria and Albert Museum
on Exhibition Road in London. I used to walk past these every day and
wondered why no one had filled them in – as the V&amp;amp;A is one of our most
precious buildings we have. Then one day I saw the small plaque where
these word are carved in&amp;nbsp;stone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The damage to these walls is the result of enemy bombing during the
blitz of the Second World War 1939-1945 and is left as a memorial to the
enduring values of this museum in a time of&amp;nbsp;conflict.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I could literally touch the holes where shrapnel from bombs had blown
holes. I could touch the data. I held my breath and for that moment I
was there in far more a real experience than any I had previously had of
the war. The data from an event 70 years ago had touched me when I
touched it. I had travelled through&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So can we do this to space data? Can we build connections between people
here on earth that reach across the vastness of space – to far-off
stars  – and across the vastness of time – to the very origins of the
universe itself? We hope we can! Which is why when Ali Llewellyn from
Open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; got in touch a year ago we literally jumped for the chance to
work with her and her team in making space data real here on&amp;nbsp;earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been hacking together examples as demonstrators, or starting
points, of new ways to connect people to space data. To give an example,
if you start to put people’s emotions first then loneliness rather than
measured distance is a great way to connect people to space. Rather than
think of Mars Rover or Voyager as machines sending data over distance
you start to think that they are out there all alone; on cold dark
planets or at the far reaches of space. Forever alone.   It is this
starting point that can start to make data more human. To make data a
thing we want to love… Then we start to connect people to their
loneliness… what would this mean? What could we&amp;nbsp;design?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our friend the jeweler &lt;a href="http://www.digitaljewellery.com/jaynewallace/home.html"&gt;Jayne Wallace&lt;/a&gt; is on our panel and her take on
this is about the way data we receive now has been generated in the
past, possibly billions of years ago – right back to origins of the
universe&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Our lives have a pace to them and time is both something we crave more
of yet know has an ultimately finite quality for us. Our interactions
with the digital are quickening our pace of life and altering not only
the texture of days and years but also how we value, measure and
perceive the passing of time. But there are things that are bigger than
us, things older than we can imagine, things that give our atomized view
of life and the time we have a very different perspective and we simply
have to look up to start to engage them. We want to explore what it
would mean to use digital technologies and space data to subvert our
relationship with time and bring fresh potential to the digital objects
we live with and through. Through design we can use space data to create
ways to experience now things that occurred before humankind existed, we
can read by the light of a lamp connected to the live feed from a
telescope and know that when it flickers a new planet has been
discovered and we can connect to the orbits and rhythms of planets
through objects that gently respond to these different cycles and be
reminded that we are part of something much greater, much faster, much
slower and much more fascinating than our atomized lives sometimes allow
us to consider.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re also sharing our panel with someone who has more than a little
knowledge and authority on the science behind all of this – [David
McGloin ]&lt;a href="many%20of%20you%20will%20know%20as%20@dundeePhysics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His team of
undergraduate,  high school teachers and pupils have been exploring ways
to connect to the dark side of the moon for use in the education of ways
of conducting optical measurements of space&amp;nbsp;objects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We know that space is one of things that most inspires high school
students to study subjects such as physics at University, but it’s
clearly a challenge to get hands in practical work while still at
school. Our  project is an example of how we can use space data to try
and make a more physical and immediate connection to the subject.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heading up our panel is Open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s very own &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/adllewellyn/"&gt;Ali Llewellyn&lt;/a&gt;. I asked
her what excites her about making space data&amp;nbsp;Physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;From the time I was a child, I wanted to touch the stars. I wanted to
walk on other planets with my own feet and fly a spaceship with my own
hands. While I am not an astronaut, and there isn’t yet a human presence
on Mars – making space data physical enables me to get closer than most
humans can yet get to those opportunities. My work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/01/28/pivot/"&gt;open
innovation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;mass collaboration&lt;/a&gt; is dedicated to exactly this:
enabling everyone on planet Earth to contribute directly and
substantially to the exploration&amp;nbsp;mission.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then asked her what she thought were the possibilities that this
approach&amp;nbsp;presents?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This approach inspires everyone with the wonder of exploration by
making the data engaging and allowing it to inform a new context. (Who
doesn’t want to drive Curiosity or touch the sun?) This approach
democratizes exploration for all citizens – making what we are learning
in space accessible to everyone on planet Earth.  This approach
encourages new approaches and opportunities to the challenges we face in
improving life on our planet and taking our species off-planet. This
approach extends the usefulness of space data. While the data often had
one initial research purpose, we are “recycling” it for other
applications and uses, especially in new&amp;nbsp;contexts”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And why getting our hands ‘in’ data is an amazing&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;In the time it took you to read this sentence, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; gathered
approximately 1.73 gigabytes of data from our nearly 100 currently
active missions! We do this every hour, every day, every year – and the
collection rate is growing exponentially. Handling, storing, and
managing this data is a massive challenge. Our data is one of our most
valuable assets, and its strategic importance in our research and
science is huge. We are committed to making our data as accessible as
possible, both for the benefit of our work and for the betterment of
humankind through the innovation and creativity of the over seven
billion other people on this planet who don’t work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. What would
become possible if everyone could not just access but remix and reuse
the images, maps, metrics and lessons learned from this amazing trove of
observation?&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;– John F. Kennedy, Nov. 3, 1961 in establishing the United States
Agency for International Development (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have often expressed the strong belief that the technology developed
for space exploration and the research conducted in space can make [huge
contributions toward solving many of the problems facing our planet][]. 
Beginning tomorrow, I will act on that belief and go &amp;#8220;on loan&amp;#8221; to the
United States Agency for International Development (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;). While there,
I will help apply space technology to the challenges facing the
developing&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Kennedy&amp;#8217;s landmark speech at Rice University a little more
than 51 years ago shifted the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; space program into high gear. &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm"&gt;We
Choose To Go To The Moon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; became the mantra that set our nation on a
peaceful path of space exploration and scientific achievement for the
betterment of all humanity. A few weeks after the Rice speech, and with
the same spirit of progress and innovation that would propel humans to
the moon, &lt;a href="http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history"&gt;President Kennedy established &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help lift millions
out of poverty, alleviate suffering and advance the foreign policy
interests of our&amp;nbsp;nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and its &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html"&gt;international partners&lt;/a&gt; continue to build on both
legacies. The International Space Station is a premier and unique
research facility that operates around the clock to improve life on
Earth, while it orbits our planet 16 times a day. The research conducted
aboard the space station simply cannot be duplicated anywhere on Earth
and is leading to [new materials, new medicines, a better understanding
of the human body, environmental issues][] facing our planet and much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;

struggling to make a better life, recover from a disaster or striving to
live in a free and democratic country.&amp;#8221; It has embarked on an ambitious
agenda that aims to change the way it does business, with by
establishing new partnerships, emphasizing innovation and focusing
relentlessly on results. This agenda provides the opportunity to
transform &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; and unleash its full potential to achieve high-impact
development. I&amp;#8217;m looking forward to being part of the team that
implements these new changes as we strive to more effectively help
improve the lives of&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; already collaborate on significant programs to apply
scientific and technological solutions to challenges facing millions
around the world. My role will be to help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; establish a broad
applied research program and to act as program manager for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
participation in the &lt;a href="http://www.unitynode.org"&gt;Unity Node&lt;/a&gt; project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Applied Research Program seeks to find innovative ways to advance
technology development and to apply new technologies to development
challenges. The Unity Node project seeks to build a universal open
source collaborative platform that humanitarian organizations around the
world can use to work together toward their common&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s goals are ambitious: protecting human rights, improving global
health, advancing food security and agriculture, improving environmental
sustainability, furthering education, helping societies prevent and
recover from conflicts, and providing humanitarian assistance in the
wake of natural and man-made&amp;nbsp;disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; research and experience will greatly help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; achieve its
ambitious goals. I am excited to be a part of both teams, where I&amp;#8217;ll be
able to help fulfill &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s mission of bettering life on Earth by
working with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; to give it practical application in the developing
world. By combining expertise from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, we will help meet
even more sustainable development challenges on the ground, solving
problems for the world&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to fly what could be my last flight in a
T-38 jet for a while. As I flew a few laps around the Gulf of Mexico, I
remembered my last moments aboard the International Space Station before
Andrey Borisenko, Sasha Samokutyaev, and I flew a &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/blog/2011/11/coming-back-down-to-our-fragile-oasis-2/"&gt;few laps around our
planet prior to returning to our Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. I felt then, and I
feel now, that I&amp;#8217;m completing one chapter of my life and about to begin
a new one. It&amp;#8217;s an exciting moment, and I can&amp;#8217;t wait to see first-hand
the results of applying space technology to development&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

preparations to engage their local communities in building and creating
better tools to explore and communicate about space. We invited Madrid
local lead Addy Nunez Beltre to share about why he and his team got
involved in Space Apps and their plans to lead the event in Spain.
(Banner image is the Iberian Peninsula from&amp;nbsp;space.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I want to start this note with a very special message to all those
who, without being the fastest, constant or bravest manage to get
remembered, they do not know the rules but change or invent new ones and
win trophies more important than gold - not because they have fans but
because of the people who love them - to welcome you all to the biggest
challenge: the world International Space Apps Challenge&amp;nbsp;2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Local Leader for Madrid (Spain) and supporting the Local Leader for
Azua (Dominican Republic), if you hear me talk about the early days of
Space Apps, I wanted to enter this world of technology, but I never
thought it could be through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Challenges of this magnitude could
inspire a great technology&amp;nbsp;company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several things I can learn, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of my small startup; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
has done things well and I think at a good pace. There are several
things we can learn from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and its efforts: let&amp;#8217;s look at everything
that drives &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and how they are changing the world for the&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think Space Apps Challenge fulfills a social mission to make the world
more open and connected - I&amp;#8217;m doing it because it was something I really
wanted personally, and I believe it was something that had to exist
globally. Contributors, media, team leaders, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; team, and all that is
part of this whole ecosystem to me means being able to build something
that causes a big change in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During this time I have moved fast, I built things and learned fast all
that is part of Space Apps Challenge 2013, more afraid of missing
opportunities than anything else. But this is precisely what keeps us
one step further in a changing world, with the support of a great team
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and above all the most important, a very good team of people
with a similar vision, all the local leads in every city, collaborators
(in my case collaborations with teams Madrid Emprende and Madrid
International Lab &lt;a href="http://www.madridemprende.com"&gt;www.madridemprende.com&lt;/a&gt;) &amp;#8230; we are building
something great with people with the same&amp;nbsp;vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People will remember you for the good things that you end up doing and
above all I am learning a few things: one is to focus on having a clear
direction on what we build and the other is trying to build the best
team. I&amp;#8217;m convinced that in Space Apps Challenge 2013 we have those two
things and we are doing really&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In&amp;nbsp;Spanish:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoy quiero empezar esta nota lanzando un mensaje muy especial a todas
aquellas personas que sin ser los más rápidos, constantes o valientes
consiguen ser recordados, que no conocen las reglas, las cambian o
inventan unas nuevas, que ganan trofeos mucho más importantes que el oro
porque no tienen admiradores sino gente que les quieren, a todos
vosotros bienvenido al desafío más grande el mundo International Space
Apps Challenge 2013. Como Leader Manager Local Madrid y Support Team
Leader Manager Local Azua, si me escuchas hablar de los primeros días de
Space Apps, te digo que yo quería entrar en ese mundo de tecnológicas,
pero que nunca pensé que sería a través de &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tech. Pensaba que los
desafíos de tal envergadura tendrían que construirlos una gran empresa
dedicada a la tecnología, ahora hay varias cosas que puedo pensar y
sobre todo aprender, como &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; de mi pequeña startup pienso que Space
Apps Challenge cumple ya 2 años, se ha convertido en su propio imperio
abierto a la colaboración global, la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; ha hecho cosas bien hechas y
creo que a buen ritmo, hay varias cosas que podemos aprender de la &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
y sus pasos: echemos un vistazo a todo aquello que impulsa &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; y a cómo
su equipo está cambiando el mundo para mejor y pienso que Space Apps
Challenge fué construido para cumplir una misión social de hacer el
mundo más abierto y conectado, como Leader Manager Local Madrid y
support team Azua, lo estoy haciendo porque era algo que realmente
quería a nivel personal, y porque creo que era algo que tenía que
existir a nivel global, aunque no estaba muy seguro de que pudiese
desempeñar ese papel, dentro de Space Apps las colaboraciones, trabajo
en equipo y todas esas cosas me importaran por que participamos de todas
oportunidades desarrolladas para llegar a tener éxito de una manera
significativa. Colaboradores, soportes, líderes de equipos, equipo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,
y todo lo que sea parte de todo este ecosistema para mí significa ser
capaz de construir algo que provoque un gran cambio en el&amp;nbsp;mundo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Durante este tiempo me he movido rápido, he construido cosas y he
aprendido rápido de todo lo que forma parte de Space Apps Challenge
2013, con más miedo de perder oportunidades que de cualquier otra cosa,
una gran experiencia a favor de los cambios o de pivotar, pero
precisamente eso es lo que mantiene a un paso más allá en un mundo en
constante cambio, con el apoyo de un gran equipo detrás &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; team y
sobre todo lo más importante, es un equipo muy bueno de gente con una
visión parecida, creo que cada leader manager de cada ciudad, equipo de
apoyo de &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, colaboradores (en mi caso colaboraciones con los equipos
de Madrid Emprende y Madrid International Lab www.madridemprende.com)…
vamos construyendo algo grande con gente con la misma visión, cada cosas
parte de Space Apps Challenge 2013 completa las habilidades del resto,
la gente, a lo largo, no te recordará por los errores que cometas, no te
van a juzgar por eso, la gente te recordará por las cosas buenas que
acabes haciendo y sobre todo estoy aprendiendo un par de cosas, una es
centrarme en tener una dirección clara en lo que construimos y la otra
es intentar construir el mejor equipo para hacer esos y convencido estoy
que en Space Apps Challenge 2013 hemos conseguido esas dos cosas y
estamos haciendo las cosas bastante súper&amp;nbsp;bien.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="locations"></category><category term="space apps"></category><category term="Spain"></category></entry><entry><title>mWater</title><link href="/mwater" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-02-21T11:31:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-02-21:mwater</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can space technology have implications for international
development? We invited &lt;a href="http://mwater.co/"&gt;mWater&lt;/a&gt; team member Amanda Sperber to share
mWater&amp;#8217;s amazing story and this case study on applying the work we do in
space to improving life on&amp;nbsp;Earth. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s a real way to take the experience and perspective gained from
space exploration and apply it to development on&amp;nbsp;earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When John Feighery, a co-founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.ewb-jsc.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; chapter of Engineers
Without Borders&lt;/a&gt;, was in El Salvador working to create a safe water
source in the area, he was disturbed to note there was no capacity for
monitoring the water after the source was created. Microbiology labs are
not cheap to&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, John was the lead engineer for air and water monitoring on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s International Space Station and was influenced by his wife Annie,
a behavioral health scientist working in global health. They noted the
striking similarities between Annie’s work in impoverished communities
and his in space. As John saw in El Salvador, when it comes to water
safety the extreme environments that define both outer space and very
poor places are quite analogous. Both are far from microbiology labs and
trained technicians. This means short of setting up (and then
maintaining) a lab, there’s no way to regularly monitor the water. The
remote water monitoring system that John had designed for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; was ideal
for monitoring water sources back on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merging Annie’s work in global public health and John’s in sanitation,
the couple founded &lt;a href="http://mwater.co/"&gt;mWater&lt;/a&gt;, dedicated to innovating open source
technologies for water and sanitation in low resource&amp;nbsp;communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 they teamed up with software engineer Clayton Grassick at the
&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt; Hackathon in Montreal. Unimpressed with the
issues originally put forth for the weekend, Clayton searched the
archives and came upon the petrifilm bacteria counting problem John
proposed. Clayton won the Hackathon by making John and Annie&amp;#8217;s idea a
reality, writing the code for what would become mWater’s mobile phone
app. Since them, using his twenty years of computer science experience,
he has continued to develop the software conceived that weekend to
produce the mWater client app. In the summer of 2012, the water test and
app underwent a rigorous validation study in Mwanza, Tanzania funded by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Habitat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mWater demonstrates the immense opportunities in which technology can be
harnessed to vastly impact development. Diarrhea and waterborne diseases
including cholera and dysentery are an enormous cause of unnecessary
suffering and mortality in the global south. According to the World
Health Organization, waterborne diseases are the number of cause of
death, with 3.4 million recorded in 2009. A United Nations commissioned
assessment recorded that 4,000 children die each day from these
preventable diseases caused by exposure to unsafe water. At the Rio + 20
United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development in June 2012, it
was acknowledged that universal access to clean drinking water is a
basic human right and added to the text of &lt;em&gt;The Future We&amp;nbsp;Want.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mWater app is connected to a phone’s onboard camera, and users can
take a picture of the test kit’s petrifilm plate. Within minutes it can
be established if the water is safe to be used even to wash one’s hands,
let alone to drink and use for cooking. The results are then uploaded to
a cloud-based database, tagged on the mWater map. People that live in
the area and who can access a smartphone or the Internet are able to
check a water source&amp;#8217;s quality. This allows them to find the safest
water possible and doesn’t require a laboratory or even electricity.
Water managers and donors are able to monitor a water source’s ongoing
function from&amp;nbsp;afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Annie explains, this is game changing in two ways. First, she says,
“a lot of times when people monitor a water source, the information gets
lost in a paper trail.” Nothing is actually accomplished. Secondly,
mWater allows users to track a water source’s safety over time. “mWater
can create a longitudinal water monitoring system,” Annie says, “this is
totally unprecedented.” She laughed and added, “We aspire to be the Yelp
for water, a place for people to make informed water choices.” Both
official and anecdotal inputs on the water source can be&amp;nbsp;included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mWater is an open source platform. The team thinks it’s unethical to
study a person’s water source and not freely provide them with
information. Clayton has created an open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; that can be adapted for
other challenges in low-resource regions. This December, mWater
co-hosted the Global &lt;a href="http://www.sanitationhackathon.org/"&gt;Sanitation Hackathon&lt;/a&gt; and the wining &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt; team
adapted mWater’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to create a tracking system for open sewage&amp;nbsp;flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mWater’s app launched in alpha this past August and in beta in December.
In its alpha stage about 800 people worldwide downloaded it and began
using mWater to record water quality results. The app is a free download
on the Google Play Store for Androids and can be accessed on any
smartphone platform through its browser. The team plans to offer a
native iPhone app later this year. Right now the tool’s main users are
academics and researchers and mWater is currently working with the
Rwanda Ministry of Health and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; Habitat to pilot the app with health
workers in&amp;nbsp;Rwanda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mwater.co/"&gt;mWater&lt;/a&gt; is a wondrous example of the capacity of technology and the
free-flow of data to tangibly impact public&amp;nbsp;health.&lt;/p&gt;

Local leads at 70 sites all over the world are in the midst of
preparations to engage their local communities in building and creating
better tools to explore and communicate about space. We invited Manila
local lead Dean Marc to share about why he and his team got involved in
Space Apps and their plans to lead the event in the Philippines. (Banner

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DI_Tandem_NASA_SpaceAppsManila_v20130216.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="ManilaBanner" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/DI_Tandem_NASA_SpaceAppsManila_v20130216.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my walk back to the Hive, as we call our team at the Dungeon, I am
again struck by a fleeting gloom whenever I look up at the night sky and
see something completely ordinary: nothing; well, almost&amp;nbsp;nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from the passing glitter of planes en route to their destinations,
a spatter of wispy clouds, and the lambent glow of the urban sky, I see
no stars. While I am aware of the Bortle Dark-Sky Scale, skyglow, and
the effects of weather conditions and air pollution in visibility, no
amount of excuse cheers me up at that point in&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, surprise! Upon reaching the Hive, on a piece of recycled A4 hanging
on one of our pin walls is writ &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MANILA&lt;/span&gt;, nasa Manila.&amp;#8221; The word
&amp;#8216;nasa&amp;#8217; also happens to mean &amp;#8216;in&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;at&amp;#8217; in our native language to
denote location. I still cannot believe our team has been afforded the
chance to host the International Space Apps Challenge in Manila. While
we are still advocating to ensure logistical and participation
feasibility by allying with partners and sponsors through varying levels
of sponsorship (i.e. Planetary, Lunar, Stellar, Galactic, and Cosmic),
we are very hopeful and&amp;nbsp;confident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I am proud to say that our teams are perhaps some of the geekiest,
smartest, and purpose-driven bunch in this part of the globe, we humbly
operate mostly in the shadows and under&amp;nbsp;stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not see the Space Apps Challenge here as a chance to prove to the
world that our country or our industry has developed sophisticated
technology or solutions nor is it a statement of competence in relation
to the level of vibrancy and intensity in comparison to other economies,
locations, or technology startup&amp;nbsp;arenas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would be surprised to know that when we spoke with some very
knowledgeable technology people here, it takes more than a few seconds
for them to recall what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is and the significance and benefit it has
offered to the world at&amp;nbsp;large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are aware that taking this initiative to bring and promote the
International Space Apps Challenge here is fraught with difficulties on
cultural, social, technological, professional and community aspects.
&lt;strong&gt;Fail or succeed, we take it on upon ourselves to be catalysts for the
future in our tiny, little way. We start here at our own&amp;nbsp;backyard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margaret Mead said, &amp;#8220;Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful,
committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it&amp;#8217;s the only thing
that ever&amp;nbsp;does.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the spirit of the event. This is the spirit of our long-term
commitment to this endeavour. &lt;strong&gt;This is the spirit within everyone who
truly wants to make a&amp;nbsp;difference. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

by &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/alexh"&gt;Alex Howard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From April 20 to April 21, on Earth Day, the second international &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;Space
Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; will invite developers on all seven continents to the
bridge to contribute code to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given longstanding concerns about the &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/08/app-contests-sustainability-usability.html"&gt;sustainability of apps
contests&lt;/a&gt;, I was curious about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s thinking behind &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/15/nasa-launches-second-annual-international-space-apps-challenge"&gt;launching this
challenge&lt;/a&gt;. When I asked &lt;a href="http://fedscoop.com/nasa-open-government-team-broadens-focus-to-innovation/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open government team&lt;/a&gt; about the
work, I immediately heard back from Nick Skytland (&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/Skytland"&gt;@Skytland&lt;/a&gt;), who
heads up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open innovation&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The International Space Apps Challenge was a different approach from
other federal government ‘app contests’ held before,” replied Skytland,
via&amp;nbsp;email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Instead of incentivizing technology development through open data and a
prize purse, we sought to create a unique platform for international
technological cooperation though a weekend-long event hosted in multiple
locations across the world. We didn’t just focus on developing software
apps, but actually included open hardware, citizen science, and data
visualization as&amp;nbsp;well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aspects of that answer will please many open data advocates, like Clay
Johnson or David Eaves. When Eaves recently looked at &lt;a href="http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/23146/app-contest-or-not-app-contest"&gt;apps contests&lt;/a&gt;,
in the context of his work on &lt;a href="http://opendataday.org/"&gt;Open Data Day&lt;/a&gt; (coming up on February
23rd), he emphasized the importance of events that build community and
applications that meet the needs of citizens or respond to business&amp;nbsp;demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of my email interview with Skytland&amp;nbsp;follows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is the International Space Apps Challenge worth doing&amp;nbsp;again?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Skytland:&lt;/strong&gt; We see the International Space Apps Challenge event
as a valuable platform for the Agency because&amp;nbsp;it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates new technologies and approaches that can solve some of the
    key challenges of space exploration, as well as making current
    efforts more&amp;nbsp;cost-effective.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses open data and technology to address global needs to improve
    life on Earth and in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrates our commitment to the principles of the [Open
    Government Partnership][] in a concrete&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What were the results from the first&amp;nbsp;challenge?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Skytland:&lt;/strong&gt; More than &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/04/25/100-reasons-spaceapps-made-a-difference/"&gt;100 unique open-source solutions&lt;/a&gt; were
developed in less then 48&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were &lt;a href="http://www.dvice.com/archives/2012/05/space-apps-chal.php"&gt;6 winning apps&lt;/a&gt;, but the real “results” of the challenge
was a 2,000+ person community engaged in and excited about space
exploration, ready to apply that experience to challenges identified by
the agency at relatively low cost and on a short&amp;nbsp;timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does this challenge contribute to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s&amp;nbsp;mission?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Skytland:&lt;/strong&gt; There were many direct benefits. The first
International Space Apps Challenge offered seven challenges specific to
satellite hardware and payloads, including submissions from at least two
commercial organizations. These challenges received multiple solutions
in the areas of satellite tracking, suborbital payloads, command and
control systems, and leveraging commercial smartphone technology for
orbital remote&amp;nbsp;sensing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a large focus of the Space Apps Challenge is on citizen
innovation in the commercial space sector, lowering the cost and
barriers to space so that it becomes easier to enter the market. By
focusing on citizen entrepreneurship, Space Apps enables &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to be
deeply involved with the quickly emerging space startup culture. The
event was extremely helpful in encouraging the collection and
dissemination of space-derived&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you know, we have amazing &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/"&gt;open data.&lt;/a&gt; Space Apps is a key
opportunity for us to continue to open new data sources and invite
citizens to use them. Space Apps also encouraged the development of new
technologies and new industries, like the space-based 3D printing
industry and &lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/28/a-mini-sub-made-from-cheap-parts-could-change-underwater-exploration/"&gt;open-source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/06/14/open-hardware-exploration-at-neemo16/"&gt;remote submersibles for underwater
exploration&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How much of the code from &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/solutions/"&gt;more than 200 “solutions”&lt;/a&gt; is still in&amp;nbsp;use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Skytland:&lt;/strong&gt; We didn’t track this last time around, but almost all
(if not all) of the code is still available online, many of the projects
continued on well after the event, and some teams continue to work on
their projects today. The best example of this is the &lt;a href="http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/pineapple-project"&gt;Pineapple
Project&lt;/a&gt;, which participated in numerous other hackathons after the
2012 International Space Apps Challenge and just recently was accepted
into the Geeks Without Borders accelerator&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the &lt;a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;71 challenges&lt;/a&gt; that were offered last year, a low percentage
were &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; challenges — about 13, if I recall correctly. There are many
reasons for this, mostly that cultural adoption of open government
philosophies within government is just slow. What last year did for us
is lay the groundwork. Now we have much more buy-in and interest in what
can be done. This year, our challenges from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; are much more
mission-focused and relevant to needs program managers have within the&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, many of the externally submitted challenges we have come
from other agencies who are interested in using space apps as a platform
to address needs they have. Most notably, we recently worked with the
Peace Corps on the &lt;a href="http://innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov/"&gt;Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; they offered at &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;RHoK&lt;/a&gt; in
December 2012, with great&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge was a way for us not only to move
forward technology development, drawing on the talents and initiative of
bright-minded developers, engineers, and technologists, but also a
platform to actually engage people who have a passion and desire to make
an immediate impact on the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What’s new in&amp;nbsp;2013?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Skytland:&lt;/strong&gt; Our goal for this year is to improve the platform,
create an even better engagement experience, and focus the collective
talents of people around the world on develop technological solutions
that are relevant and immediately&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a high level of internal buy-in at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and a lot of
participation outside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, from both other government organizations and
local leads in many new locations. Fortunately, this means we can focus
our efforts on making this an meaningful event and we are well ahead of
the curve in terms of planning to do&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, 44 &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/01/04/where-in-the-world-is-space-apps/"&gt;locations&lt;/a&gt; have confirmed their participation and we have
six spots remaining, although four of these are reserved as placeholders
for cities we are pursuing. We have 50 challenge ideas already drafted
for the event, 25 of which come directly from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. We will be releasing
the entire list of challenges around March 15th
on &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;spaceappschallenge.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have 55 organizations so far that are supporting the event, including
seven other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; government organizations, and international agencies.
Embassies or consulates are either directly leading or hosting the
events in Monterrey, Krakow, Sofia, Jakarta, Santa Cruz, Rome, London
and&amp;nbsp;Auckland.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="citizen science"></category><category term="civic hacking"></category><category term="data visualization"></category><category term="Earth Day"></category><category term="Gov 2.0"></category><category term="NASA"></category><category term="Open Data"></category><category term="open hardware"></category><category term="open science"></category></entry><entry><title>NASA announces the 50 locations for the 2013 International Space Apps Challenge</title><link href="/nasa-announces-the-50-locations-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-28T17:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-01-28:nasa-announces-the-50-locations-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WASHINGTON&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8212; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and government agencies worldwide will host the
second International Space Apps Challenge on April 20-21, with events
across all seven continents and in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants are encouraged to develop mobile apps, software and
hardware, data visualization, and platform solutions that could
contribute to space exploration missions and help improve life on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-day event will provide an opportunity for government to harness
the expertise and entrepreneurial spirit of citizen explorers to help
address global challenges. During the event, representatives from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
and other international space agencies will gather with scientists and
participants to use publicly released open data to create solutions for
50 software, hardware and visualization challenges, including robotics,
citizen science platforms and applications of remote sensing data.
Challenges selected to be worked on during the event will be published
online prior to the&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 challenge engaged more than 2,000 participants who collaborated
on more than 100 open source solutions to 71 featured&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;What sets apart the International Space Apps Challenge from other
events is that this is a collaborative opportunity to engage people from
all over the world to participate in space exploration and develop
state-of-the-art technology to improve life on Earth and in space,&amp;#8221; said
Nick Skytland, program manager of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Open Innovation&amp;nbsp;Program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In true startup fashion, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open government team has mastered the
art of the government&amp;nbsp;“pivot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popularized by “The Lean Startup“ author Eric Ries, the concept of the
pivot centers around an organization’s ability to adapt its focus based
on the realization of new market potential or service&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of fiscal year 2013, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open government group did
just that, formally adopting new nomenclature to emphasize innovation,
and now serves under the banner of “open&amp;nbsp;innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Innovation Program Manager Nick Skytland and his team,
this isn’t about semantics. It’s about better serving the agency in an
era of crowd-generated ideas and&amp;nbsp;contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Openness, including open innovation platforms, open data and open
technologies, such as open source software and hardware, says Skytland,
is a fundamental catalyst to government leveraging the masses to further
its&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open innovation team, serving as an internal innovation
engine is a key function that could play a defining role in helping the
agency realize its impact to Americans beyond just&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the open government movement evolves in how it addresses core issues
around transparency, collaboration and participation, Skytland says it
makes sense that it would find itself included under a broader
innovation&amp;nbsp;umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a natural progression of what open government looks like inside
government agencies.” said&amp;nbsp;Skytland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is no stranger to open innovation. The agency was a leader in the
open source cloud computing movement with its contributions to OpenStack
via the now decommissioned Nebula project. It is a regular collaborator
on developer hackathons, including Random Hacks of Kindness, the
International Space Apps Challenge and the recently-announced National
Day of Civic Hacking, among others. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Spinoff database is a
repository of the agency’s intellectual property, open for adoption by
entrepreneurs&amp;nbsp;anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrating a formal approach to innovation has emerged in government as
a key component to fostering public sector ingenuity and creativity. The
Department of Labor and the National Archives have appointed
senior-level executives to serve as chief innovation officers. The White
House Presidential Innovation Fellowship program, established in 2012,
is another high-profile example of encouraging a culture beyond the
bureaucracy. A cursory search of federal government employees yields
nearly 200 with the word innovation in their official&amp;nbsp;titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To Skytland and his team, open innovation is part open government, part
digital strategy and part mass collaboration. On the latter, the maximum
potential of any government will only be achieved when it effectively
opens itself to citizen&amp;nbsp;participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re now taking the approach from the inside where we ask ourselves
‘what are the challenges that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s trying to solve that we haven’t
been able to address for one reason or another?’ How can we take those
challenges and offer them to people outside of our own organization, as
well as people inside our organization, by using open innovation
platforms with the goal of aggregating those solutions for the benefit
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team is comprised of Skytland, Chris Gerty, Ali Llewellyn, Sean
Herron and Astronaut Ron Garan, and reports directly to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Chief
Technology Officer for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Sasi&amp;nbsp;Pillay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ‘open’ in open innovation stands for the bi-directional aspect of
innovation and collaboration. That is, we take ideas from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and seed
it externally and we take ideas from external sources and seed them
inside. This thinking truly promotes a truly open collaborative&amp;nbsp;environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; faces a future of lean space budgets, the open innovation pivot
may help lead it to a new final&amp;nbsp;frontier.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Space Meetup at SXSW</title><link href="/space-meetup-at-sxsw" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-28T08:57:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2013-01-28:space-meetup-at-sxsw</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Join &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive"&gt;Interactive&lt;/a&gt; portion of &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/"&gt;South by Southwest
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; this year in Austin! There are a number of space-related
panels, sessions and exhibits this year, including a special James Webb
Space Telescope &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; exhibit (which you can visit even if you are not
attending &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;!). The James Web Telescope exhibit will be open from
Friday March 8 through Sunday March 10th. We also want to extend an
invitation for you to join the entire space community at a Space Meetup
on on Sunday March 10th at 1:30pm at the Meet Up Pavilion in the Austin
Convention Center.  Since we have such a strong representation from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
and the space community at SXSWi, this year we wanted to create an
intentional forum for everyone to come together at least one time during
the event.  We have worked to plan all the other space sessions so as
not to conflict and hope you will consider joining us.  This is your
chance to meet others and mingle with some extremely innovative people
from the space community as well as exchange stories about your favorite
space mission with some of the people who were directly&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included below is a complete list of all the space-related activities
planned for SXSWi. This list includes both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-led events as well as
non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; events - they all look amazing!  If I&amp;#8217;m missing something on
this list, let me know and I&amp;#8217;ll add it. We look forward to seeing you&amp;nbsp;there!&lt;/p&gt;

Moon where the cold vastness of space will allow it to study the
universe’s first galaxies as well as celestial objects hidden by clouds
of cosmic dust. Stop by the lawn outside the Long Center (701 W.
Riverside Drive) March 8-10 to see Northrop Grumman’s
tennis-court-sized, four-story-high, full-scale model of the Webb
Telescope. Learn about the vision behind Webb and the challenges of its
construction in this immersive experience that showcases the science,
images and technologies changing our understanding of the universe. Free
to the public, this exhibit features Microsoft’s interactive World Wide
Telescope and activities with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; that demonstrate how Webb will
inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers to push the
boundaries of science and technology. Delve in for an in-depth look at
the perplexing questions that this incredible telescope is designed to
answer, such as: How did the universe form? Is our solar system unique?

America discover &lt;a href="http://www.hackforchange.org"&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt; and come forward to
help out. The sheer volume of interest has given me cause to step back
and think about the impact and potential behind the initiative. Our
Country faces great challenges as we move forward in the 21st century.
That said, I am reminded of the words of&amp;nbsp;Plato:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The beginning is the most important part of the&amp;nbsp;work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I would not presume to imply that the National Day of Civic
Hacking will prove to be the savior of our economy, the solution to our
changing climate, or the answer to the social inequalities that still
plague our nation, I strongly believe that it is an opportunity to
engage brilliant minds across the country to rethink civic
participation, contribute to their communities, and take an active part
in their democracy. Our country&amp;#8217;s problems can not be solved by any one
group alone. Rather, it requires the meaningful union of citizens of all
kind - including entrepreneurs. Only by utilizing a diverse array of
backgrounds, knowledge, and experience can we begin to address the
issues important to all&amp;nbsp;Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our government is formed of, by, and for the people. In order for it to
succeed, the people must hold a healthy skepticism of government - but
they also must realize that it can only flourish when fed the collective
ingenuity of its citizens. Our generation&amp;#8217;s faith in government has been
tested more than ever before. However, as President Obama said on
Monday, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it - so long as
we seize it&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to see you join us as we enter the next era of democracy&amp;#8217;s Great
Experiment, and I welcome your feedback on how we can meaningfully
engage with citizens as we strive to provide opportunities for them to
engage and contribute to the United States of&amp;nbsp;America.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Roll Up Your Sleeves, Get Involved, and Get Civic-Hacking</title><link href="/hackforchange" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-22T15:42:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2013-01-22:hackforchange</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a cross-post from a White House Office of Science and
Technology Policy blog posted &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/01/22/roll-your-sleeves-get-involved-and-get-civic-hacking"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer, on June 1-2, 2013, citizens in cities across the Nation
will join together to improve their communities and governments as part
of the National Day of Civic&amp;nbsp;Hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civic Hacking Day is an opportunity for software developers,
technologists, and entrepreneurs to unleash their can-do American spirit
by collaboratively harnessing publicly-released data and code to create
innovative solutions for problems that affect Americans. While civic
hacking communities have long worked to improve our country and the
world, this summer will mark the first time local developers from across
the Nation unite around the shared mission of addressing and solving
challenges relevant to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; blocks, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; neighborhoods, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; cities, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt;
states, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking is a call to action for anyone who wants
to make a positive impact on their town, city, and country. A coalition
of leading organizations, companies, and government agencies have banded
together to issue this challenge with the goal of promoting
transparency, participation, and collaboration among governments,
startups, and citizens. These partners will support Civic Hacking Day by
hosting activities across the country that invite anyone to become part
of the civic hacker community—whether you’re a newbie or an expert—and
by connecting people in person or online during the weekend&amp;nbsp;celebration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event is taking place in conjunction with &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org"&gt;Random Hacks of
Kindness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://codeforamerica.org/"&gt;Code for America&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s Brigade meetings and is being
modeled after the &lt;a href="http://innovationendeavors.com/"&gt;Innovation Endeavors&lt;/a&gt;’ Super Happy Block Party. A
number of Federal agencies, including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, the Census Bureau, and the
Department of Labor, are participating by offering specific challenges
for hackers to work during the&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an opportunity for citizens in every town and city across the
Nation to roll up their sleeves, get involved, and work together to

Mainstage - kind of like a mission control for intergalactic space
collaborations? Last year we were based in San Francisco, and &lt;span
style="color: #800000;"&gt;this year we are excited to announce that the
2013 Global Mainstage will be in &lt;strong&gt;Philadelphia&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We invited Philadelphia local lead &lt;a href="http://www.azavea.com/about-us/staff-profiles/andrew-thompson/"&gt;Andrew Thompson&lt;/a&gt;, Community
Evangelist from &lt;a href="http://www.azavea.com/"&gt;Azavea&lt;/a&gt;, to share about why he and his team got
involved in Space Apps and their plans to lead the global&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I told a friend of mine that my organization was going to work with
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to host the Global MainStage event in Philadelphia of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
International Space Apps Challenge, he got really excited. “I would take
a 50% pay cut to work for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,” my friend said. I share his enthusiasm.
There is just something fundamentally amazing and compelling about space
science and exploration. The challenges, tools and data with which folks
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; grapple are the raw material of dreams and aspirations for
everyone from kids to backyard astronomers to developers and technology
nerds like&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Space Apps Challenge is about more than just cool &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; tech. It
is also concerned with a fundamental transformation of how we interact
with technology at a cultural and social level. It aims to both
cultivate and contribute to the growth of &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"&gt;open government, open data&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://civic.io/2012/12/31/the-year-that-civic-hacking-changed-everything/"&gt;civic hacking&lt;/a&gt;. The community of developers and technologists
that are using their skills for social benefit - and have fun doing it -
is an awe-inspiring and awe-some community with which to engage. In
particular, Philadelphia has a &lt;a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/"&gt;very&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.azavea.com/a/hacks-for-democracy"&gt;robust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://techcampglobal.org/philadelphia.php"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt; of
civic-minded software hackers, makers and &lt;a href="http://christopherwink.com/2011/12/19/social-entrepreneurship-how-philadelphia-could-have-a-regional-distinction-for-startups/"&gt;social entrepreneurs&lt;/a&gt;. As
folks like &lt;a href="http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596804350/defining_government_2_0_lessons_learned_.html"&gt;Tim O’Reilly&lt;/a&gt; have pointed out, open government and civic
hacking represent an alternative approach to the tax, vote, and complain
pattern of engaging as a citizen in a democratic society. Global
collaboration efforts like Space Apps build communities, create
friendships, exercise social capital, and show us that with some
imagination and effort we can solve problems in our society (and beyond
our planet) together. As I read over what happened in the &lt;a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/debrief/#/hello"&gt;2012
International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I see that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; “gets it” with
respect to this community. That’s exciting to see from a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than the fact that the main stage event will be in our home town,
Philadelphia, why would a small company like ours get involved? There
are a number of reasons. As a software firm focused on geographic data
analysis, our core business relies on much of the earth science and
space-borne sensors that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; launches and supports. Further, open
source software, data visualization, and citizen science are part of our
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;. In addition to our work with civic applications related to water
and trees, our open source GeoTrellis framework was created to address
some of the big data and high performance computing challenges presented
by the array of sensors &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; operates to observe our planet. Finally, we
feel that Philadelphia is an ideal place for this year’s Space Apps
Challenge. The event will be part of &lt;a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/2012/08/20/philly-tech-week-2013-third-annual-celebration-of-innovation-scheduled-april-19-27"&gt;PhillyTechWeek 2013&lt;/a&gt; and the
&lt;a href="http://www.philasciencefestival.org/"&gt;Philadelphia Science Festival&lt;/a&gt; in late April, and hosting Space Apps
is our way of contributing to our local science and technology
community. So save April 20th and 21st on your calendar, and come join
us in Philadelphia or any one of the over 25 other Space Apps cities&amp;nbsp;worldwide!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are anywhere near Philly, we hope you&amp;#8217;ll join us there for Space
Apps and help us make this site out of this&amp;nbsp;world!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

when we were first inspired by the space program. We saw these amazing
achievements and thought, quite accurately, that there was cutting-edge
technology at work, being developed by brilliant engineers. Oh, how we
longed to work alongside and someday become one of those&amp;nbsp;engineers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the achievements of today, nothing is lost from that
effect. Skycranes and spacesuits still inspire. Galaxies are discovered
with lenses and techniques that boggle the mind. The hardware being
developed at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is truly cutting&amp;nbsp;edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what happens to all of this cutting edge hardware in the long-term.
Does it retain its impact to society, its relevance to our planet, and
most compellingly - its coolness factor? Is open source technology
itself, powered by its community, encouraged to reach for the stars - in
much the same way we were in elementary&amp;nbsp;school?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tribute to the relevance and enduring global impact of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
technology, we would like to highlight a video blog we stumbled upon
today. Fran Blanche acquired a piece of hardware called the Launch
Vehicle Digital Computer, which in her words is the &amp;#8220;most important
circuit board in&amp;nbsp;history&amp;#8221;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/J0ggqY7vnAw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fran&amp;#8217;s quest is to learn more about the design decisions made in the
past as they relate to the open source hardware movement of today. Her
enthusiasm for the impact of the inner-workings of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LVDC&lt;/span&gt; brings this
Computer Engineer back to the days I dreamed of working at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Her
follow-up video where she actually &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWGpF05zhdU"&gt;takes the board to her dentist for
x-rays&lt;/a&gt; is just as awesome&amp;#8230;. and I hope she finds more and more
answers as she continues her quest! (an introduction is needed between
Fran and Ben Krasnow with his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hF3V-GHiJ78"&gt;Arduino-controlled &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt; scanner&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways we have come full-circle. The open source community is
making the same decisions that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; engineers made in Apollo, but for
flexibility and hack-ability desires of today rather than reliability
and manufacturability challenges of the past. Can this global community
collaboratively make the next giant leap? Are we witnessing a rebirth of
electronic technology&amp;nbsp;development?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What else could this open source community learn from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;legacy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what could the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; of today learn from&amp;nbsp;theirs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/telstar/2936600/"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/telstar/"&gt;Telstar Logistics on flickr&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="apollo"></category><category term="open hardware"></category><category term="Open Source"></category><category term="video"></category></entry><entry><title>Where in the World is Space Apps?</title><link href="/where-in-the-world-is-space-apps" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-04T12:34:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2013-01-04:where-in-the-world-is-space-apps</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge team has been hard at work with

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; astronaut and openNASA team member &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/bloggernauts/Astro_Ron/"&gt;Ron Garan&lt;/a&gt; subverted the
system last night, using this unique platform as an opportunity to ask
the public &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; views on human space&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[I am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; astronaut Ron Garan, I want to do an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMA&lt;/span&gt; but instead I want
to ask you: What do you think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; should do next? What&amp;#8217;s should be the
next destination for human space&amp;nbsp;exploration?][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMA&lt;/span&gt; has received 2,353,756 reads and 5818 comments in 15 hours.
The Moon, Mars, Mercury and asteroids are widely debated&amp;#8230; as well as
space elevators, technology development, astronaut candidacy and
exploration of the oceans. [One of my favorites was about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; education
and the value of (perservering through) learning math.][] And some of
those comments are incredibly insightful regarding what we do at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,
the public&amp;#8217;s view of space exploration and thoughts on where we should
go&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think it really matters where
human spaceflight goes next, as long as it&amp;#8217;s up and out and beyond where
we&amp;#8217;ve been before.&amp;nbsp;Permanently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;If people saw &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as a savior for
financial problems, a scientific powerhouse, as an institution that
directly benefited them, they wouldn&amp;#8217;t want to cut&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;I&amp;#8217;d like to see &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; turn into a more
international organisation. And to be more open on their projects so
that they can use crowd sourcing as a means of research, testing and
contribution. Humans need to work together if we are going to get off
this rock to explore outside of our solar system. Time to forget about
country lines and work as&amp;nbsp;earthlings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;That doesn&amp;#8217;t necessarily mean no moon
bases. It does mean, however, that you can&amp;#8217;t go at the idea primarily in
terms of &amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s set up a moon base&amp;#8221; but rather in terms of &amp;#8220;What would a
moon base get us, and what technological advancements must we focus on
to get there?&amp;#8221; Then, you can sell your idea to a public and to
politicians who may not understand the importance of moon&amp;nbsp;bases.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;My thought is we need to develop the
technologies for self-supporting, sustainable communities on Earth. We
have limited high quality resources on our planet, and our waste
products are threatening our quality of life here. The same technologies
that you need for a good future here on Earth are the ones you need for
a colony in space. So develop them, and apply them to Earth first,
because that is where all the people are. Once you get them good enough,
apply them to space&amp;nbsp;also.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;The next destination for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; should be
Elementary, Middle, and High-Schools across the country. I can&amp;#8217;t imagine
that you and your colleagues don&amp;#8217;t &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOVE&lt;/span&gt; what you do for a living. If you
took some of that passion to the classrooms of soon-to-be voters and got
them excited about the possibilities of the space-program you would do
more to ensure the future of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; than anything else I can think&amp;nbsp;of. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reader argued that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s focus has to be &lt;strong&gt;daring mighty&amp;nbsp;things:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[You ask what I want to see from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. I want to see &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; do things that
will inspire what I cannot possibly imagine. I want &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to accomplish
the impossible and cause a ripple effect that brings about something
even greater than what they&amp;#8217;ve done. I want to see a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; that inspires
me and everyone around me to understand that impossible is only a
limitation that I restrict upon&amp;nbsp;myself.][]&lt;/p&gt;

the impact of past RHoK events can not be understated.  RHoK has an
impressive and influential history.  The effort, which is only three
years old, has already resulted in 177 hackathons in 37 different
countries producing thousands of solutions.  There are a number of past
RHoK projects that serve as guiding examples of what&amp;#8217;s possible in just
48 hours, from those developed in the early days and still in use
like &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/hack-chasm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/rhok-success-stories-openstreetmap-tasking-manager"&gt;Open Street Map Tasking Manager&lt;/a&gt;, Risk-in-a-Box
(now &lt;a href="http://inasafe.org/"&gt;InaSAFE&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/78315"&gt;First Responde&lt;/a&gt;r and &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/hack-caritas-germany-mapping-app"&gt;Caritas Disaster Mapping&lt;/a&gt;,
as well as [Bushfire Connect ][], to more recent RHoK projects
like &lt;a href="http://phillysnap.com/"&gt;PhillySNAP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/1679530/sheltr-app-helps-you-direct-the-homeless-to-food-shelter"&gt;Sheltr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.watervoices.ca/"&gt;WaterVoices&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://adhawk.sunlightfoundation.com/"&gt;AdHawk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bringfood.org/client-desktop/index.php"&gt;Bring the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New RHoK&amp;nbsp;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, hundreds of new challenges will be tackled, including
problems presented by hackers at each of the 30 events as well as a
diverse set of Featured Problems coming from the &lt;a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/"&gt;Peace Corps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://codeforamerica.org/"&gt;Code
for America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.worldbank.org/"&gt;World Bank&amp;#8217;s Sanitation Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;.  You can
see all the &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/featured-problems-december-2012"&gt;feature problems here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems"&gt;all the problems here&lt;/a&gt;.  At
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we are particularly excited about the opportunity presented by the
&lt;a href="http://peacecorpschallenge.org/"&gt;Peace Corps Innovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to positively impact the developing
world by developing innovative solutions for the real challenges faced
by Peace Corps Volunteers. We have included an overview of the 10
challenges here and encourage you to use your time this weekend at RHoK
to&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;hack for peace&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The [Peace Corps Innovation Challenge][] is based on a simple yet
powerful idea:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the on-the-ground knowledge of the over 9,000 Peace Corps
    Volunteers who live and work in some of the most remote areas of the
    developing world to identify and articulate the day-to-day&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then, empower talented and concerned citizens from around the world
    to work together to deliver innovative, meaningful, and practical&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, make these tools easily available to all those living and
    working in the developing world on open-source technology&amp;nbsp;platforms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RHoK&amp;nbsp;Accelerator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are one of the teams participating in RHoK and you are interested
in taking your solution farther, check out the &lt;a href="http://gwob.org/apply"&gt;Geeks Without Bounds
accelerator program&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GWOB&lt;/span&gt; will help take teams through a six month
mentorship cycle to bring good intentions to a state of deployment. The
way it works is that if you are selected, you will be connected with
other developers from the global community who can aid in tool learning,
maintenance, and further development. The goal is to improve your
solution and transition it into operation.  You can now apply for our
next round of acceleration, but make sure to get your applications in&lt;em&gt;by
December 15th&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow Along&amp;nbsp;Online&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are not able to physically participate in a RHoK event this
weekend, you can still follow along online!  Our team will be attending
events in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Rochester and will be providing
live updates of the experience. Here is a video capturing the opening
remarks at the Atlanta&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;

Strategy&lt;/a&gt; to the Office of Management and Budget. The 6 month
milestones for our &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/06/20/the-roadmap-for-digital-government/"&gt;Digital Strategy&lt;/a&gt; are the 2nd update we&amp;#8217;ve made to
the plan, following our 3 month milestones that we launched in August.
There are a number of new things that we&amp;#8217;re super excited to&amp;nbsp;share:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Digital Services Governance Framework&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Digital Strategy is cross-cutting and involves dozens of leads and
potentially hundreds of potential participants from across the agency.
As a result, as we work towards implementing many of the goals of the
strategy, its imperative that we also look at how we manage our overall
direction and focus to ensure that the right people are getting involved
and that we&amp;#8217;re working efficiently&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Governance Strategy, the majority of which was written by the
awesome Sarah Rigdon in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Web Services office, plans to help us
focus our efforts by establishing the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Clearly Defined Scope of&amp;nbsp;Authority&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Core Principals to Guide&amp;nbsp;Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Established Roles and&amp;nbsp;Responsibilities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Target&amp;nbsp;State&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more of the governance strategy at
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Agency-wide Inventory of Mobile Devices and Contracts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html#5-1"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We also developing an inventory of mobile devices and contracts at the
agency which we expect to deliver to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMB&lt;/span&gt; shortly. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees use
thousands of mobile devices, from smartphones to mobile hotspots to
pagers (yes, pagers - they still have some use in specialized
situations!), to stay connected to their work around the globe. We&amp;#8217;re in
the midst of a major transition to a new service provider under the
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/dec/HQ_C10-080_ACES.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACES&lt;/span&gt; contract&lt;/a&gt;, which has given the agency a great opportunity to
look closer at the mobile services we offer to employees and make them
even&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt; group at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has focused on our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BYOD&lt;/span&gt; (Bring Your
Own Device) policy as a major way to empower employees to stay connected
to their work. As part of this, we&amp;#8217;ve realized that mobile interfaces
and responsive design are more important than ever in ensuring the
services &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; offers both internally and to the public are accessible,
usable, and&amp;nbsp;extensible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, our Digital Strategy is available in a number of formats,
including &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;XML&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s also
available to the public via &lt;a href="http://www.github.com/nasa/digital-strategy"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We hope you&amp;#8217;re excited as we are with the progress we&amp;#8217;re making on
implementing a Digital Strategy for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. As always, if you have
comments, questions, or feedback for us, please leave us a comment -

We operate thousands of websites
covering pretty much every topic imaginable. Events such as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135
Space Shuttle Launch and the Mars Curiosity rover landing bring millions
of visitors watching streaming video live. According to an &lt;a href="http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/nasa.gov"&gt;Alexa
report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.gov is the 732nd most visited website in the world
(498th in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;), beating the White House (2,813th) and a number of
other extremely popular&amp;nbsp;websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since we launched our last design in 2007, the online landscape has
changed. Social Media has exploded and the growth of mobile web traffic
has placed a huge importance on &lt;a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/"&gt;responsive design&lt;/a&gt; and adaptive
experiences. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s web team enters a new brainstorming process on
the future of the site, they want *your* input on how to make it even&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now until December 19th, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is accepting feedback for new ideas
on functionality and strategy. Have a suggestion? Go ahead and submit,
vote, and comment on ideas at &lt;a href="http://nasaweb.ideascale.com"&gt;http://nasaweb.ideascale.com&lt;/a&gt;. They&amp;#8217;d
love to hear from&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this all fits very well with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy"&gt;Digital
Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, which is shaping how the agency offers its services to the
public online. There&amp;#8217;s currently a huge effort to offer more &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;raw
data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section2.html#2-1"&gt;APIs&lt;/a&gt; for public consumption. We&amp;#8217;d love your feedback on
how to improve this initiative, as&amp;nbsp;well!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="digital strategy"></category><category term="nasa.gov"></category><category term="web"></category></entry><entry><title>We’re Back.</title><link href="/were-back" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-11-14T11:35:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-11-14:were-back</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; was an international
hackathon-style event that took place over a 48 hour period in cities on
all seven continents on the weekend of 21 - 22 April 2012. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; led the
international collaboration with 8 other government agencies and 90
additional organizations. The event took place in 25 cities, dispersed
over 17 countries on all seven continents as well as online. The
challenge brought together 2,083 registered participants (ages 16-70)
together to address 71 challenges that were grouped into four broad
categories including open source software, open hardware, citizen
science platforms, and data visualization. More than 100 unique
solutions were developed in less than 48 hours during the event - many
that had direct tangible benefits to existing programs at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. All
solutions were developed in a completely open source environment, and
each have their own unique potential to go even further to address world
and space technology&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge was the largest government-led
hackathon to date. It demonstrated that a non-monetized collaboration
could have significant value for government agencies and serves as a
model for how government can accelerate technology development.
Spaceflight data and the needs of the exploration mission proved to be
the ideal environment to foster this type of innovation. (You can learn
more about what the community accomplished &lt;a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/debrief/#/hello"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have good news: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WE&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BACK&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Apps Challenge brings citizens from around the world together
- in virtual and physical spaces - to create software and hardware
technologies that solve challenges in space exploration and on
Earth. Preparations for the second event, planned for &lt;strong&gt;April 2013&lt;/strong&gt;,
have just begun. The effort is currently led by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Innovation
Program team, but we are intentionally focused on expanding the
leadership team and the international reach of the event. The vision to
engage the skills and perspectives of citizen scientists, makers,
developers, technologists, educators and entrepreneurs in the
exploration mission is one that is vital for all - and benefits&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need your experience and perspective to help make it&amp;nbsp;awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

Gerty at &lt;a href="http://sf.sciencehackday.com/"&gt;Science Hack Day San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;. Science Hack Day brings
together designers, developers, scientists and other geeks in the same
physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking,
and building ‘cool stuff’ focused on science. I went to&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/13/science-hack-day-sf/"&gt;last year&amp;#8217;s
event&lt;/a&gt; as well and was super impressed with the many awesome projects
that came out of the weekend - this year was no let down,&amp;nbsp;either!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We began the weekend by offering a lightening talk on some of the many
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-related data resources available out there that participants could
use in their projects, including &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://helioviewer.org/api/"&gt;Helioviewer&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://exoapi.com/"&gt;exoAPI&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/ws/v10/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ECHO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the weekend, we aimed to be the &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; boots on the ground&amp;#8221; -
offering help to those who wanted to do things with our data or focus on
space exploration. It was incredible to see so many intelligent people
in one room so excited about science - many of whom also participated in
the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; last&amp;nbsp;April.&lt;/p&gt;

November 2012.  A special thank you to Redbull for use of the image of
Felix Baumgarter jumping from the edge of space, to Sam Wilkinson for

&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/52800470" frameborder="0" width="600" height="400"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the things Astronauts who have had the privilege of traveling to
space talk about when they return is what it’s like to see Earth from
space. They describe what its like to see the whole world at once, every
90 minutes, and the orbital perspective that this brings. They talk
about what it means to live in a world where we are more interconnected
and dependent on one another than ever before – how it shifts their
thinking. They talk about what Astronaut Rusty Schweikart first observed
in 1969 on Apollo 9, a world where our boundaries disappear, our
problems overlap and we realize that the solutions are not one nation’s&amp;nbsp;alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although only about 500 people have ever had the chance to physically
experience this orbital perspective, thanks to technology, the rest of
us are just now starting to share these same experiences. We now live in
an age where &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; makes it possible that a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/15/felix-baumgartner-skydive-youtube"&gt;record-setting eight
million&lt;/a&gt; of us can watch &lt;a href="http://www.redbullstratos.com/about-felix/felix-baumgartner-pilot-biography/"&gt;Felix Baumgartner&lt;/a&gt; jump from the edge of
space live on the Internet! Today, we can take a photo on Mars and
stream it to your mobile device minutes&amp;nbsp;later!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As people around the world become more and more technologically
literate, and start to experience this orbital perspective themselves,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; are not only demanding more participation in government affairs, but
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; are expecting to participate on your terms, using common technology,
and with a purpose much bigger then just space exploration. You are not
only interested in seeing the problems with government; you actually
want the opportunity to help fix them. You are not just calling for
greater transparency in government; you are seeking greater
participation. Thankfully, technology is opening the doors so that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;
can now collaborate with government to help shape solutions to the grand
challenges of our times, the ones that require not only government
participation, but participation by all of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this means for governments worldwide is that participation is no
longer limited to showing up to vote on election day, sending a letter
to your Congressman and hoping for a response, expressing your concern
by protesting about your favorite cause, or accepting a government job
to be able to make a difference. There are now other ways to participate
directly in&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what this means for governments at every level – local, state and
federal – is simple. &lt;em&gt;Our job is to engage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, doing this has previously been very hard for government.
Although government has always been a platform for collective action (at
least in the United States), the problem is that it’s never really been
an efficient one at connecting people together and scaling their
participation in a focused and useful way. But thanks to technology,
connecting people to what we do inside government does not have to be
complex. It is not rocket science. The formula is&amp;nbsp;simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more we enable people like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; who fundamentally care about
government and want to contribute to the future of our world - the
better chance we will ever have in helping our governments live up to
their true potential and actually developing solutions to the grand
challenges of our&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s the key. It’s not just about &lt;em&gt;individual participation&lt;/em&gt;; it’s
about &lt;em&gt;mass collaboration&lt;/em&gt;. It’s about creating platforms that allow us
to take advantage of the exponential power of what happens when a
thousand eyes look at our toughest problems and we collectively develop
a&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass Collaboration is something that is particularly possible today
because of the Internet and our place in history. It is technology that
really enables the creation and application of ideas at scales
previously unimaginable, in a focused way. There are so many good
examples of mass collaboration at work today. If masses can peer-produce
an operating system, write an encyclopedia or the Icelandic
constitution, one should carefully consider what might come&amp;nbsp;next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have the privilege of leading a team of entrepreneurs and
technologists who are focused on considering what comes next for
government, specifically at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. We are experimenting with new ways to
harness the potential of mass collaboration to help accomplish the
impossible mission we have been given. Our goal is to do everything we
can to connect &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; to what we are doing, not only to develop new
technology, or even solve tough problems, but to fundamentally improve
government - to make it more open and&amp;nbsp;participatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognizing that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; didn’t really have a way to engage citizens on
such a scaled and relevant way, we set off to create one. In 2012, we
hosted the first &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. It was the
largest government-led mass collaboration event to date, and a real
testament to what people can do together if given the permission,
opportunity and resources. The event demonstrated that thanks largely to
the Internet, the kind of creativity and innovation that used to take
place primarily behind closed doors within large institutions, is
increasingly taking place by people simply connected together online.
The solutions developed at the event were so impressive, and the demand
to do another event like it so strong, that we have decided to host a
second International Space Apps Challenge in April 2013! I encourage you
to check it out and get&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If space exploration isn’t your thing, or if you are interested in
experimenting with the concepts of mass collaboration to help solve the
grand challenges &lt;em&gt;most relevant to you&lt;/em&gt;, I encourage you to check out
another event called the &lt;a href="http://hackforchange.org"&gt;National Day of Civic Hacking&lt;/a&gt;. This
national collaboration will be held the first weekend in June 2013 and
another great opportunity to connect with others just like you from all
over the nation, with the simple purpose of working together to improve
the cities we live in and the governments that serve them. Our vision is
to connect people in at least one city in all 50 states, from Honolulu
to New York, from Seattle to Houston. There are already a number of
events planned around the nation, with participation by a host of
government agencies and private sector organizations, and I encourage
you to get involved! To participate is simple, visit hackforchange.org
and help plan an event in your city or join one that is already in the
works. This is an opportunity for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; to see the world without borders,
to connect with others, to contribute something that matters and to make
a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just imagine what we could do together if we all shared an orbital
perspective! We could improve our cities, we could reshape our economy,
we could develop new game changing technology, we could improve
outdated, outmoded, inefficient government - &lt;em&gt;at all levels&lt;/em&gt;. After all,
once you see Earth from space, you realize we are all in this&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe governments need to continue to be bold, to take risks, to do
what intimidates most others, like when we went to the moon or when we
landed a rover on Mars. We need to do the things that not only inspire
our nation, but our world. But I also believe that we can’t do this
alone. Solving the grand challenges of our time - the one’s that you
will tell your grandkids about - will require all of us. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s true
potential - any organization’s true potential - will never be unlocked
if you only tap the intelligence of those on your payroll. Limiting
participation to those inside your organization just doesn’t make sense
in the information age. We must enlist anyone willing to contribute the
time, talents and resources, to serve alongside us in order to tackling
the impossible challenges, both locally and&amp;nbsp;globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We truly live in a world today where the possibilities are limited only
by our imagination and our will to act and there is no better time than
now to get&amp;nbsp;started.&lt;/p&gt;

Leadership (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; publicly released its first iBook publication on
the topic of orbital debris mitigation. Sometimes referred to as &amp;#8220;space
junk,&amp;#8221; orbital debris is subject to national and international
requirements that emphasize a “pack it in, pack it out” framework for
space missions. These practices, which are essential for maintaining
safe access to space, are important to aerospace engineers and policy
makers around the world. The orbital debris iBook gives you – the
engineer, the Space Tweep, the biologist, the concerned citizen, the
environmentalist, the teacher, the political scientist, the law student
– the chance to share the same materials &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; uses in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s orbital
debris&amp;nbsp;course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first of what we hope will be more books to come related to
courses taught by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;.The future of learning at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is no longer
confined to a classroom. This iBook speaks to the larger trend of the
democratization of knowledge, where anyone can learn anything, any time,
any&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is an interview with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt; Director and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Chief Knowledge
Officer Dr. Ed Hoffman on the iBook and learning at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, which was
originally published in the October issue of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;’s monthly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASK&lt;/span&gt; the
Academy&lt;em&gt;newsletter. While this initiative is still evolving, we hope you
take a moment to[download the iBook or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; of the orbital debris iBook
and let us know what you&amp;nbsp;think.][]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, September 28, 2012, the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/home/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Academy of Program/Project &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
Engineering Leadership (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; publicly released its &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/knowledge/publications/appel-releases-ibook.html%20%20http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/knowledge/publications/appel-releases-ibook.html"&gt;first iBook
publication&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; training materials on the topic of orbital debris
management and risk mitigation. This new electronic book platform,
introduced in the spring of 2012, enables the seamless integration of
text with videos, 3-D models, image galleries, and interactive&amp;nbsp;graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;’s Orbital Debris Management and Risk Mitigation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ODM&lt;/span&gt;) training
course provides mission-critical knowledge that helps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; missions meet
the agency’s overarching strategic goals and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; National Space
Policy goals for sustainability in space. The new iBook supplements
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s existing course taught by Dr. Nicholas L. Johnson, Chief
Scientist in the Orbital Debris Program Office at Johnson Space Center.
These supplementary materials are now freely available to&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASK&lt;/span&gt; the Academy&lt;/em&gt; caught up with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt; Director and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Chief Knowledge
Officer, Dr. Ed Hoffman, to gain additional insights about what this new
publication suggests about the future of learning at the&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASK&lt;/span&gt; the Academy&lt;/em&gt;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATA&lt;/span&gt;):&lt;/strong&gt;The recently released orbital debris iBook
repurposed and built upon interactive content and knowledge from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;’s
existing course on the subject. Why is this&amp;nbsp;exciting?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ed Hoffman:&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve been in the learning, training, and education world
for thirty years and you’re always limited without realizing you’re
limited by the fact that you can only extend your knowledge as far as
whoever is in the room. So you typically have twenty, maybe thirty
people in the room, and that would be considered a great crowd. That has
since&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I’m excited about in terms of the iBook is that now you can have
information, lessons, and knowledge materials that are available to
anybody in the world at any time. For someone like me, that’s just mind
boggling to be able to see that. So you can have the audience in the
room, but also engage an audience outside of the&amp;nbsp;classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the concerns that I always had in terms of the learning is that
we’ve had a lot of great people over the years, over the decades who
would present, and it always frustrated me with the fact that I couldn’t
capture what these people were delivering so that others outside of the
room or outside of the day, the time, and the year could hear it and
this opens up a whole different world of opportunity. Orbital debris is
a key issue for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the space world. We had the good fortune to get
a subject expert, Nicholas [Johnson], who is phenomenal. He’s blessed
with both the knowledge and the talent, and he is also a great teacher.
So I’m thrilled with the iBook&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;How do you see this aligning with where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt; and the agency are
headed with leveraging technology to facilitate learning from a&amp;nbsp;distance?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoffman:&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt; has always been an advocate for the learning and
development of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s engineering and technical workforce. As part of
that, we have to deliver knowledge, learning, and training to
practitioners to where they are, when they need&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this type of learning fits with our future in that we’re
responding to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s strategic learning priorities in a way that we have
to find what are the best ways to establish the learning [content],
generate the materials, to use subject matter experts inside and outside
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to figure out the best way to be successful with the missions
and the challenges we have, and to share&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we have to take it so that we have a platform that can really fly
any place. The things that we need to know are not just available in a
room, but available anytime. It’s timeless. Some of the things may be
important enough so that in 100 years, if people want to click
something—if we still click on things then—they’ll be able to hear a
presentation from some of the folks that we have in terms of why
decisions were made. What were some of the strategies that were used?
What have we learned after making this sort of content&amp;nbsp;available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a smart phone, tablet, or a computer, ideally you should be
able to watch aspects of a presentation that are most germane to what
someone is interested in, or you could learn a whole series of content.
Ideally, to me, that should be the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;What other topics might we see covered in this sort of format in
the&amp;nbsp;future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoffman:&lt;/strong&gt;Our goal is to link to what we call &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; strategic learning
priorities. A strategic learning priority is something that it is so
important to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mission that a large number of people have to hear
it, understand it, and learn from it. We need to be on the lookout for
those learning&amp;nbsp;priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For something like sustainability, which is a relatively new topic,
there’s a lot we need to learn about it. That would be something that I
think we could do a lot with and that could go to a really broad&amp;nbsp;community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt;’s International Project Management course addresses what you need
to know in terms of managing a complex program that’s international. In
the course, 50 percent of the students are from our international
partners. The ability to capture aspects of that, or eventually the
whole course, so that people all around the world can learn from it,
would be the type of targeted training program that I’d like to look at
for this type of&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;What sort of impact do you think this type of learning has on
more traditional classroom&amp;nbsp;environments?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoffman:&lt;/strong&gt; I teach courses at George Washington University and
Columbia University, and one of the things I’ve found is with distance
classes, in many ways, the students in those venues sometimes seem to do
a little bit better. And I think it’s because they don’t take for
granted the fact that they’re going to be getting together in a room.
They know that they sometimes have limited time windows that they can
ask questions or talk. They’re working in teams at a distance so they
have to be aware of when they come together, how they collaborate. When
the technology is really effective it gives an extra charge of we’re
connecting, we’re talking, we’re doing things. So I think there are some
advantages to distance&amp;nbsp;learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also with distance learning, you have to have a little bit of the artist
in you because you can’t rely on the person being there to entertain
you, to engage you, to tell you the stories. So you have to look at
these new courses from the standpoint of the art, the visuals, the
sequencing, the simulations, and the engagement. To me, that’s what I’m
so excited about, and that’s why I think it’s so critical because it
gives us the chance to try new types of engagement on a worldwide&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will still have people who say that none of this stuff can be as
good as being in a classroom. There is always going to be a need for the
person-to-person, but you can do things in a way that capture the
content in a way that is so beautiful that you want to have&amp;nbsp;both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also provides the continuity. We’ve had training in the past where
people would come together, would establish great relationships, but
then there wasn’t connectivity. Now you can have ongoing learning
relationships that you could never have in the&amp;nbsp;past.&lt;/p&gt;

Hardware Summit&lt;/a&gt;, sponsored by the newly formed Open Source Hardware
Association (&lt;a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSHWA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).  What we witnessed was a
community in its early stages, developing in front of our eyes, tackling
technical/legal/cultural challenges with an openness that we have grown
to respect and see as an essential part of the way &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will do business
in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many interesting aspects of this growing community – from
the power that community platforms have in the design and manufacturing
of open hardware (&lt;a href="http://www.arduino.cc/"&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/"&gt;Thingiverse&lt;/a&gt;, and the newly launched
&lt;a href="https://opendesignengine.net/"&gt;Open Design Engine&lt;/a&gt;), to the striking desire of this community to
explore – encouraging kits like &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/575960623/ardusat-your-arduino-experiment-in-space"&gt;CubeSat designs&lt;/a&gt;, or
entire sets of projects like in &lt;a href="http://makezine.com/24/"&gt;this space and science-themed issue&lt;/a&gt;
of &lt;a href="http://makezine.com/"&gt;Make: magazine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event was truly a melting pot of the maker community.  Take for
instance the citizen scientists of &lt;a href="http://publiclaboratory.org/home"&gt;Public Laboratory&lt;/a&gt;. Their mission
is to foster a distributed community who specializes in using open
technology to investigate environmental concerns. Also represented in
force was the emerging open source driven 3D printer market. A variety
were on display, and even &lt;a href="http://makerbot.com/"&gt;Makerbot&lt;/a&gt;’s own Bre Pettis was on-hand to
give his thoughts on the new Replicator 2.  Of course the Maker
community would not be well represented without the namer (or namesake,
depending on who you ask) of the community itself. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; and founder
of &lt;a href="http://makezine.com/"&gt;Make: Magazine&lt;/a&gt;, Dale Dougherty, took us through the
history of the “Make:” brand, and reflected on his influencers along
that journey. Since this Maker community strives to re-teach &lt;em&gt;each
other&lt;/em&gt; absolutely everything they learn, Dale’s choice to focus on
something that very few in the community already knew seemed perfect for
this&amp;nbsp;venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning home and having time time to consider what I’ve learned,
two major takeaways resonate with me in the context of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and its&amp;nbsp;future:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;1.  Open source hardware is helping to make spaceflight accessible to
anyone,&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I simply need to point to a stellar presentation by Stephen
Murphey, &lt;a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/open-sourcing-the-final-frontier/"&gt;Open Sourcing the Final Frontier&lt;/a&gt;.  During the presentation
he outlined the cubesat platform, and how (and for how much
out-of-pocket money) one can get involved.  Cubesats are designed to fit
in the extra pockets of space left by large, expensive payloads, and can
therefore be launched opportunistically when space is available.  To me,
this served as a practical, as well as a metaphorical example of how
small experimental projects within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; have the potential to make a big
difference, and it also makes the philosophies of Open Government even
more relavant as we continue to explore with essential help from outside
the walls of&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/52059111" frameborder="0" width="500" height="375"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2.  For the most audacious of humanity’s goals, even for the ones where
large government-backed efforts will lead the way, open source
philosophies are critical for not only its success, but also its&amp;nbsp;sustainability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was really more of an epiphany.  During the first session at the
#OHSummit, &lt;a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~leah/"&gt;Leah Buechley&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;’s Media Lab) told a story about
how her friend’s power inverter, lacking an open hardware design, became
a barrier to self-repair when it failed, jeopardizing their family’s
solar-powered home.  Major hardware stores and paid repairmen were hard
to come by in their remote, “off-the-grid” outpost.  At that moment I
realised how much &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; had in common with the open source hardware
community. I spent a good portion of my career pondering how humanity
may someday venture beyond Low-Earth Orbit to live on other worlds.
 Leah’s story made a crystal-clear connection between our off-the-grid
efforts on Earth, and our dreams at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to do the same throughout the
solar&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When humans leave Earth to live on other worlds, or even orbit Earth for
months at a time, the ability of a crew to repair, construct, make, and
tinker is just as important as designing robust, flexible, operable
hardware in the first place.  Replacement parts could take weeks or
months to get to the International Space Station, but imagine the
wait-time for a trip to Mars!!  Witnessing those around me in the room
nod their heads as they imagined their own solar power system, reminded
me that we at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; are responsible for &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/index.html"&gt;those living&lt;/a&gt; in the most
“off-the-grid” home of them&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attending the summit really helped reaffirm my belief that we&amp;#8217;re all in
this space exploration thing together. Secondly, if there are lessons to
be learned by &lt;strong&gt;developing hardware in an open environment&lt;/strong&gt; – and if
this in turn makes &lt;strong&gt;critical designs more sustainable&lt;/strong&gt; – then yes,
open hardware community, we are listening&amp;#8230;. &lt;em&gt;and we want to learn&amp;nbsp;more!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>How would you use a NASA API?</title><link href="/how-would-you-use-a-nasa-api" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-10-09T15:53:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sean Herron</name></author><id>tag:,2012-10-09:how-would-you-use-a-nasa-api</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#open-data-default"&gt;major focuses&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="http://whitehouse.gov/digitalgov"&gt;President Obama&amp;#8217;s Digital
Strategy&lt;/a&gt; is to encourage the development and use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s for service
delivery from government agencies. For those of you who are unfamiliar
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, this &lt;a href="http://www.quora.com/APIs/What-is-an-API-in-layman-terms"&gt;Quora thread&lt;/a&gt; provides a good description. In short,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s provide an interface for machines to talk with each other. A good
example would be the Disqus comments openNASA uses. By plugging in to
their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, we are able to offer their commenting mechanism on our site.
Simple,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s offer a lot of promise for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. We gather a lot of data - about
15 Terabytes per day! That means we brought down almost 2 gigabytes in
just the time it took you to read this sentence. Future missions like
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy_Space_Telescope"&gt;Destiny&lt;/a&gt; could collected 24 Terabytes per day &lt;em&gt;all on their own&lt;/em&gt;. As
Nick outlined &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/10/04/what-is-nasa-doing-with-big-data-today/"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, as we collect more and more data, figuring
out the best way to distribute, use, and reuse the data becomes more and
more difficult. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s are one way we can significantly lower the barrier
of entry to people from outside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; being able to manipulate and access
our public&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re just getting started with APIs, our biggest being the &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info"&gt;open data
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we launched just about one year ago. As part of the digital
strategy, we&amp;#8217;re committed to making more &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s available
(or highlighting the awesome work other people have done to create
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, like the folks at &lt;a href="http://exoapi.com/"&gt;ExoAPI&lt;/a&gt; who created one for Kepler exoplanet
data as part of the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;). We need
your help, though! As we work to share the value of APIs with other&amp;#8217;s
around the agency, we&amp;#8217;d love use cases and reasons why the public would
value being able to access &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data via an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. Have an idea? Want to
create something, but need an easier way to access our data to use it?
Want a particular dataset &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;-ized? Let us know! Any comments or
feedback you can provide would be immensely helpful as we continue our
quest towards a more transparent, collaborative, and participatory
agency. Either give your comments below, or email them to me at

&lt;em&gt;approximately&lt;/em&gt; 1.73 gigabytes of data from our nearly 100 currently
active missions! We do this every hour, every day, every year - and the
collection rate is growing exponentially. Handling, storing, and
managing this data is a massive challenge. Our data is one of our most
valuable assets, and its strategic importance in our research and
science is huge. We are committed to making our data as accessible as
possible, both for the benefit of our work and for the betterment of
humankind through the innovation and creativity of the over seven
billion other people on this planet who don’t work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In version 2.0 of our &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;Open Government Plan&lt;/a&gt;, we scratched the surface
in terms of the work that the Agency is involved in around &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-data/"&gt;big
data&lt;/a&gt;” but there is much more to&amp;nbsp;explore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a panel hosted by &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-big-data-debunked-live-stream-7000005052/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CBS&lt;/span&gt;
TechLines&lt;/a&gt; called &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Big Data Debunked &amp;#8212; Finding the Data Signals.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; I
was joined by &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-fords-michael-cavaretta-on-internal-big-data-7000004000/"&gt;Michael Cavaretta&lt;/a&gt; of Ford, &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-archimedes-katrina-montinola-7000004449/"&gt;Katrina Montinola&lt;/a&gt; of
Archimedes, &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-t-mobiles-christine-twiford-7000004728/"&gt;Christine Twiford&lt;/a&gt; of T-Mobile, &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-ibms-james-kobielus-on-big-data-talent-7000005003/"&gt;James Kobielus&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;
and ZDNet editor-in-chief &lt;a href="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/us/larry.dignan/"&gt;Larry Dignan&lt;/a&gt;. We discussed the challenges
and opportunities big data poses for organizations today. I was humbled
by their vision and so inspired by the examples that they shared, that I
wanted to share more about what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Big&amp;nbsp;Data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole idea of big data is still relatively new and most discussions
or presentations around the subject start off with a definition of what
big data really is. Definitions are certainly helpful, especially when
the topic is still relatively new, and so we&amp;#8217;ll start there oursevles.
Big data is very simply a collection of data sets so large and complex
that your legacy &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; systems can not handle them. When organizations get
to the point where their &lt;a href="http://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=124058&amp;amp;org=CISE"&gt;volume, velocity, variety&lt;/a&gt; and veracity of
data exceed storage or computing capacity, there are some big challenges
that need to be addressed. You know you have a big data challenge when
your traditional data management systems and analysis tools are
overwhelmed and it becomes difficult to process your data using the
analytic or visualization tools you currently have. Approaching the big
data challenge often necessitates advanced algorithms, infrastructure
and frameworks - and it can all seem very daunting for those just
starting out - but the reality for information-age-based organizations
is that our success is throttled by our our ability to rapidly and
comprehensively navigate the big data&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But of course, big data is relative.  In the end, big data by itself has
no value - it&amp;#8217;s meaningless. It&amp;#8217;s what you do with the data that matters
most. Today&amp;#8217;s big data discussion is often centered around how to target
advertisements or customize a user experience, which makes sense given
that the growth in the market place is so closely tied to fact that how
we interact with the physical world is more and more dependent on the
pervasive use of mobile devices that are connect to the work through
sensors. Having the ability to leverage our rich history of data and
combine it with new data we are receiving is a huge asset in making our
missions&amp;nbsp;successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are still trying to wrap your head around the difference between
petabytes, exabytes, zetabytes, and yottabytes, check out this
overview &lt;a href="http://prezi.com/pupffr4ujwqa/what-is-big-data-and-why-does-it-matter-scsim/?auth_key=28ac73cbc9454fc3f1880bc60f328b48351a0000"&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; titled &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;What is Big Data and why does it
matter&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tom-soderstrom/4/100/a99"&gt;Tom Soderstrom&lt;/a&gt;, the Chief Technology Officer for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Big Data&amp;nbsp;Challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s big data challenge is not just a terrestrial one and it goes
beyond the stereotypical challenge. Many of our “big data” sets are
described by significant metadata, but on a scale that challenges
current and future data management practice. We regularly engage in
missions where data is continually streaming from spacecraft on Earth
and in space, faster than we can store, manage, and interpret it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
has two very different types of spacecraft. We have deep space
spacecraft that sends back data in the order of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MB&lt;/span&gt;/s. Then we have earth
orbiters that can send back data in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt;/s per second. In our current
missions, data is transferred with radio frequency, which is relatively
slow. In the future, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will employ technology such as optical (laser)
communication to increase the download and mean a 1000x increase in the
volume of data. This is much more then we can handle today and this is
what we are starting to prepare for now. We are planning missions today
that will easily stream more then &lt;span class="caps"&gt;24TB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s a day.  That’s roughly 2.4
times the entire Library of Congress - &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVERY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAY&lt;/span&gt;. For one&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s still very expensive to transfer just one bit down from a
spacecraft so we want to make sure we collect what is most important.
Once the data makes its way to our data centers, storing, managing,
visualizing and analyzing it becomes an issue. To give you an idea of
what we are dealing with, the size of the Climate Change data
repositories alone are projected to grow to nearly 350 Petabytes by
2030.  5 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s is equivalent to the total number of letters delivered by
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Postal Service in one&amp;nbsp;year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One great example of the unique challenge that we face with managing
space data is just starting to be demonstrated by the &lt;a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/mira/"&gt;Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASKAP&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; project which is a large array
made up of 36 antennas, each 12 meters in diameter, spread out over
4,000 square meters but working together as a single instrument to
unlock the mysteries of our universe. The array, which will officially
be turned on and open for business tomorrow Friday, October 5, 2012, is
able to survey the whole sky very quickly and offers an ability to
perform research that could never have been done before.   Check out
this great &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;amp;v=FDoDk4D2RAw#!"&gt;time lapse video&lt;/a&gt; showing off the new telescopes
capabilities!  The array is a precursor for the larger &lt;a href="http://www.skatelescope.org/"&gt;Square Kilometre
Array&lt;/a&gt; telescope that will open in 2016 and will combine the signals
received from thousands of small antennas spread over a distance of more
than 3000 km. When operational, as much as &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Hadoop_Summit/big-data-challenges-at-nasa"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;700TB&lt;/span&gt;/second of data&lt;/a&gt; will
flow from the Square Kilometre Array! This is a big data&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course, spacecraft are not the only source of our data, thanks to
an ever-growing supply of mobile devices, low-cost sensors, and online
platforms. As an article in &lt;a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/big-data-the-management-revolution/ar/1"&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/a&gt; this month put
it, &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;each of us is now a walking data generator&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; The scale of the big
data challenge for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, like many organizations, is&amp;nbsp;daunting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can probably imagine, the increasing data volumes are not our
only challenges. As our wealth of data increases, the challenge of
indexing, searching, transferring, and so on all increase exponentially
as well. Additionally, the increasing complexity of instruments and
algorithms, increasing rate of technology refresh, and the decreasing
budget environment, all play a significant factor in our approach.
Fortunately, the entire federal government has turned their attention
towards the growing challenge. In March 2012, the Obama administration
announced the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/big_data_press_release_final_2.pdf"&gt;Big Data Research and Development Initiative&lt;/a&gt; to
“&lt;em&gt;greatly improve the tools and techniques needed to access, organize,
and glean discoveries from huge volumes of digital data&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; The goal is
to transform government&amp;#8217;s ability to use big data for scientific
discovery, environmental and biomedical research, education, and
national&amp;nbsp;security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current&amp;nbsp;Approaches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing new approaches to understanding, analyzing, and visualizing
the data we have en masse is of vital interest to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Within
government, there is a push to get ahead of big data from both the top
down and bottom up. We outlined many of the big data activities and
approaches from the perspective of the Mission Directorates
(&lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/"&gt;Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/index.html"&gt;Human Space Exploration and Operations&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/"&gt;Aeronautics&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/index.html"&gt;Technology&lt;/a&gt;) in Version 2.0 of the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open
Government Plan&lt;/a&gt;. Below are six world-class
examples of how we manage, store, archive, analyze, visualize, and apply
our big data&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Managing and&amp;nbsp;Processing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s approach to managing and processing data is demonstrated by the
&lt;a href="http://www.informationweek.com/government/information-management/nasa-makes-most-of-curiosity-rover-data/240007311"&gt;Mission Data Processing and Control System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPCS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; which was
recently used by the Curiosity rover on Mars. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MPCS&lt;/span&gt; interfaces with
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s deep-space network, and in turn the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter, to relay data to and from Curiosity and process the raw data
in real time, a process which previously took hours if not days to
accomplish. The system produces custom data visualizations that are
used by the flight operations&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nccs.nasa.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Center for Climate Simulation (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCCS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, which is primarily
used by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office and the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies, demonstrates the Agency&amp;#8217;s approach to
storing big data. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NCCS&lt;/span&gt; focuses on climate and weather data and
currently houses 32 petabytes of data, with a total capacity of 37
petabytes (&lt;a href="http://www.csc.com/cscworld/publications/81769/81773-supercomputing_the_climate_nasa_s_big_data_mission"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;). The center also has advanced visualization
tools, such as it&amp;#8217;s 17-by-6-foot visualization wall which allows for
one high-resolution surface on which scientists can display still
images, video and animated content from data housed in the&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Archiving and&amp;nbsp;Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; approaches processing and archiving are
demonstrated by the &lt;a href="http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/"&gt;Atmospheric Science Data Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASDC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, which
is focused on Earth science, and the &lt;a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/"&gt;Planetary Data System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;,
which is focused on planetary science. The Atmospheric Science Data
Center at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Langley Research Center is responsible for processing,
archiving, and distribution of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Earth science data. It specializes
in atmospheric data important to understanding the causes and
processes of global climate change and the consequences of human
activities on the climate and includes petabytes of climate data
collected over decades. The Planetary Data Systems archives and
distributes scientific data into one website from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; planetary
missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. It
offers access to over 100 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt; of space images, telemetry, models, and
anything else associated with planetary missions from the past 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://wiki.esipfed.org/images/8/89/Cloud_Computing_Talk_by_Adrian_Gartner.pdf"&gt;Pleiades&lt;/a&gt; supercomputer is used to help analyze the
challenging projects, from solar flare and space weather scenarios to
detailed space vehicle designs. Pleiades was recently used to process
massive amounts of star data gathered from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Kepler spacecraft,
leading to the discovery of new Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way
galaxy. More than 1,200 users across the country rely on the system to
perform large, complex calculations. It was also used to generate the
Bolshoi cosmological simulation which explores how galaxies and the
large-scale structure of the universe has formed over billions of&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://c3.nasa.gov/nex/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Earth Exchange (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEX&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; is a virtual laboratory that
integrates supercomputer, data system, data visualization, large
amount of online data, models and algorithms, with social network and
collaborative technology.  Prior to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEX&lt;/span&gt;, scientists were required to
invest tremendous amounts of time and effort to develop high-end
computational methods rather than focus on important scientific
problems. Now, scientists can use the supercomputer to visualize large
Earth science data sets as well as run and share modeling algorithms
and collaborate on new or existing projects. Recently, a research team
from around the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; used the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEX&lt;/span&gt; environment to adjoin an
atmospherically correct mosaic of 9,000 Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes
and retrieve global vegetation density at a 30- meter resolution. The
entire processing of the nearly 340 billion pixels in the the
composite took just a few hours on the Pleiades supercomputer,
allowing the team to experiment with new algorithms and approaches
with ease. We’ve also invested in a number of collaboration and
knowledge-sharing platform for the Earth science community that
combine supercomputing, Earth system modeling, workflow management and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; remote sensing data feeds to enable a holistic view of our work
for researchers. &lt;a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/is/upload/NIST-Big-Data-06132012.pdf"&gt;More information on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEX&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commercial cloud computing&amp;nbsp;services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent Mars Science Laboratory mission demonstrates how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
modernizing its approach to Big Data by utilizing cloud computing and
commercially available cloud storage solutions. In less than four
months, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; engineered and migrated legacy content management system
and websites to Amazon Web Services. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; relied heavily on
mission-critical applications that could sustain failure of over a
dozen data centers, while delivering over 150 Gigabits per second of
traffic to a global community of operators, scientists, and general
public. The team developed a solution that would download raw images
and telemetry directly from Curiosity and place them into Amazon S3
storage buckets. As the data streamed in, every image from Mars was
uploaded, processed, stored, and delivered from the cloud. The data
was then catalogued in highly available and scalable databases and
exposed to applications and users via a Restful interface. This
allowed the content managers for the Mars Web sites to easily create
informative Web pages with powerful real–time images. This modern
approach allowed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to deliver 120 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt; of dynamic content and 30 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt;
of static content the first night, and meet the demands when over 8
million hits were requested of their websites in less than one minute.
It also allowed the team to take advantage of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; Galaxy and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;
Nebula supercomputers which ran close to 200 24-hour Monte Carlo
simulations at 20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; each during the&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real World application of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is doing with Big&amp;nbsp;Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is doing in big data are not limited to just
the government! In fact, this work has very real implications for you.
One real world example of how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; leverages its expertise in big data,
and directly affects your life, is in the field of airline safety. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
is involved in analyzing data collected from planes &lt;a href="http://www.allanalytics.com/author.asp?section_id=1411&amp;amp;doc_id=250894"&gt;to study safety
implications&lt;/a&gt;, which in turn will help with commercial airlines’
maintenance procedure improvements and potentially prevent equipment
failures. Using advanced algorithms, the agency helped tease out
relevant information from a mountain of unstructured data to help
predict and prevent safety problems. Using the open-source Multiple
Kernel Anomaly Detection (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MKAD&lt;/span&gt;) algorithm, the agency determined how two
continuous data streams or networks are similar, and then analyzed them
using a single framework to detect patterns to automatically discovering
precursors related to adverse events while an airplane is in&amp;nbsp;flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Big Data&amp;nbsp;Opportunity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From analyzing the real-time solar plasma ejections and monitoring
global climate change to optimizing large scale engineering designs and
modernizing the way we approach mission operations, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is a leader in
the application of big data. At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; we are continuing to experiment
with new ways to harness this shifting environment and tackle the many
challenges it poses to government and the way we do business. Although
we are just in the beginning stages of in exploring the big data
universe, the opportunities are truly&amp;nbsp;limitless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/"&gt;Open Government Plan&lt;/a&gt; outlines a number of &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-data/"&gt;specific
actions&lt;/a&gt; we are taking to drive innovations in technology
around big data. We’ve created &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt; as a starting point to
engage with our data, but this is simply a directory of all the
wonderful data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; makes available. We will also continue to leverage
&lt;a href="http://www.data.gov"&gt;data.gov&lt;/a&gt; to enable users to locate relevant high quality data and
easy to use tools and&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We set a goal to &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;create new opportunities for enhanced coordination
across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Big Data activities, and expanded cooperation with other
agencies&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; with the intention of encouraging citizens to utilize raw
datasets and create applications relevant to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission. Yesterday,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; joined the National Science Foundation and the Department of
Energy’s Office of Science to announce the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/10/03/nasa-tournament-labs-big-data-challenge/"&gt;Big Data Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, a
series of competitions which will be hosted on the TopCoder platform.
Competitors will be tasked with imagining mobile apps that find new
value hidden in discrete government information domains and then
describing how they may be shared as universal, cross-agency solutions
that transcend the limitations of individual silos. This is a fresh new
opportunity to work with us and help conceptualize new and novel
approaches that our critical to the future success of government and we
encourage you to check it&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

Office of Science announced on Wednesday the launch of the &lt;a href="http://community.topcoder.com/coeci/nitrd/"&gt;Big Data
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, a series of competitions hosted through the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/ntl/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Tournament Lab&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTL&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Data Challenge series will apply the process of open innovation
to conceptualizing new and novel approaches to using &amp;#8220;big data&amp;#8221;
information sets from various &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; government agencies. This data comes
from the fields of health, energy and Earth science. Competitors will be
tasked with imagining analytical techniques and software tools that use
big data from discrete government information domains. They will need to
describe how the data may be shared as universal, cross-agency solutions
that transcend the limitations of individual&amp;nbsp;agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The ability to create new applications and algorithms using diverse
data sets is a key element for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTL&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;#8221; said Jason Crusan, director of
the Advanced Exploration Systems Division at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Headquarters in
Washington. &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is excited to see the results that open innovation can
provide to these big data&amp;nbsp;applications.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Big Data is characterized not only by the enormous volume or the
velocity of its generation but also by the heterogeneity, diversity and
complexity of the data,&amp;#8221; said Suzi Iacono, co-chair of the interagency
Big Data Senior Steering Group, a part of the [Networking and
Information Technology Research and Development Program][]. &amp;#8220;There are
enormous opportunities to extract knowledge from these large-scale
diverse data sets, and to provide powerful new approaches to drive
discovery and decision-making, and to make increasingly accurate
predictions. We&amp;#8217;re excited to see what this competition will&amp;nbsp;yield.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The competition will be run by the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/ntl/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a
collaboration between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, Harvard University and TopCoder, a
competitive community of digital creators. The &lt;a href="http://www.topcoder.com/"&gt;TopCoder Open Innovation
platform&lt;/a&gt; and process allows &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; government agencies to conduct high
risk/high reward challenges in an open and transparent environment with
predictable cost, measurable outcomes-based results and the potential to
move quickly into unanticipated directions and new areas of software
technology. &lt;a href="http://community.topcoder.com/coeci/nitrd/"&gt;Registration is open&lt;/a&gt; through Oct. 13
for the Ideation Challenge phase, the first of four idea generation

The app was designed to give an overview of the spacecraft’s current
activities, starting with the latest dramatic images. These images range
from sublime insights into another ‘set of worlds,’ considering the moon
Titan itself has been called the most earth-like body in our solar
system. Also included in the app is the ‘Present Position’ of the
spacecraft, as well as a countdown to the next major event – usually a
spectacular targeted flyby of one of Saturn’s moons. More in-depth

The Rosetta spacecraft approaches Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Using its thrusters, Rosetta goes into orbit around the comet nucleus.
Now you, the player, get to take over the spacecraft in its mission to

back that makes it worth the&amp;nbsp;trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s history, the exploration culture is easy to see - the
Apollo Program, International Space Station, the Mars Science Laboratory
and Curiosity’s 7 minutes of terror - things that bring technology and
knowledge back for humanity to use every&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; we have lofty goals, and large programs to bring them to life.
In order to make these programs succeed it requires each individual to
explore in their own role - each doer, each maker, every heart and soul.
Give them a problem and they’ll solve it! The square air duct needs to
fit in the round hole to allow the Apollo crew to breathe - the
toothbrush needs to help a critical bolt to fit into the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; - and you
just can’t be without a mohawk-sporting attitude to put a lander the
size of a car on another planet by remote control. The teams that solve
these problems are composed of some incredibly bright, committed, and
energetic people - makers at heart, always exploring, striving for that
unknown&amp;nbsp;solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we see a thirst for exploring the unknown in a
community that’s growing exponentially. The drive to take things apart,
tweak, hack, change, learn, and create on an individual level is spurred
on by the kinship that is created between these makers. Indeed,
reminiscent of New York City, this community never&amp;nbsp;sleeps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So join &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the Open Innovation Program in our quest to explore the
overlap between the explorer and maker - the similarity between folks
inside and outside &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; - and how we all can help humanity go boldly
where we have never gone&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://makerfaire.com/pub/e/9224"&gt;Find us&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/"&gt;World Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt; this coming weekend in New York

places we’ll&amp;nbsp;go.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>The Open API Universe at NASA</title><link href="/the-open-api-universe-at-nasa" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-19T16:24:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2012-09-19:the-open-api-universe-at-nasa</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt; of interesting data. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s commitment to open data
expands the audience for the vast body of knowledge captured in nearly
100 years of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and many others can contribute
directly to the exploration of space and Earth by helping to create new
ways of looking at this data. Additionally, the release of
administrative and procedural information from within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; enables
researchers and analysts to understand more about the inner workings of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as well as allow our own employees to better understand other
functions of our Agency. We are continually working to improve
accessibility to this data and incentivizing the use of government data
by citizens. One way that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data can be made more available online is
through an “&lt;em&gt;application programming interface&lt;/em&gt;” or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. While the name
may be intimidating, you probably use APIs every day. APIs bring us
real-time news, weather, and photosharing. APIs feed the content to many
of your favorite website or mobile applications. In the past few years,
APIs have experienced an exponential increase in popularity and&amp;nbsp;usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; General Services Administration&amp;#8217;s DigitalGov
University hosted a webinar titled &amp;#8220;Case Studies from the Federal
Register, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; with the purpose of discussing the use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
in government. Below is the short presentation based on some examples
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="505a1865f4e6ad000200211d" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;, or “&lt;em&gt;Application Program Interface&lt;/em&gt;”, is a set of routines and
protocols that provide building blocks for computer programmers and
application developers to build software applications. In its simplest
form, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; makes raw data accessible in a machine readable format so
you can create any application you can dream of. In the past, APIs were
largely associated with computer operating systems and desktop
applications. In recent years though, we have seen the emergence of Web
APIs (Web&amp;nbsp;Services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; doing in regards to&amp;nbsp;APIs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, data is at the heart of what we do but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is really just
getting started in it&amp;#8217;s mission to expand the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; universe. We recognize
that there is a need to organize and make sense of the ever-increasing
amount of tools and data catalogs that are publicly available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
many websites, and so we created a directory that lists the publicly
available datasets and serves to streamline the process for posting
these datasets on data.gov. The directory includes information and
direct links to hundreds of datasets. In August 2011, we launched a data
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; around the online archive of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data sets. The &lt;a href="http://www.data.nasa.gov"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; provides a RESTful interface, with responses in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
data&amp;nbsp;archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But this is just the&amp;nbsp;beginning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Wide Open&amp;nbsp;Field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. We have a lot of
work to do to build more meaningful, focused APIs that deliver the many
kinds of data we produce, and we would love your help! There is a huge
opportunity for anyone with interest to help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; make its data more
accessible and derive new meaning from existing datasets through APIs.
Whatever you can dream of doing with this public data, it’s yours to
use, and we encourage you to get&amp;nbsp;involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s response to the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html"&gt;Digital Government Strategy&lt;/a&gt;, we
are charged with creating at least two new APIs in the coming year. We
would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on what data you would like
us to focus on. We also hope to create more opportunities for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; to get
directly involved. We&amp;#8217;ll be offering a few new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; related challenges at
upcoming mass collaboration events this next year, including &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;Random

&lt;p&gt;The idea of developing an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to access an already complicated data set
or service may sound overwhelming. The good news is that the most
creative work often comes from outside the walls of government. Living
in the information age has its benefits and one of them is that there
are thousands of people around the world who can help you. In April, we
issued a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; related challenges at the International Space Apps
Challenge and the results were impressive. A virtual team of three
developers created &lt;a href="http://exoapi.com/"&gt;ExoAPI&lt;/a&gt; - a powerful tool that provides access to
exoplanet data through a simple RESTful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. The video below is not only
inspirational, but serves as an example of what can happen when we
engage citizens in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;

Organization to Innovation. The generally agreed-upon definition of
innovation in the class came from Paul Trott: “Innovation is not a
single action but a total process of interrelated sub processes. It is
not just the conception of a new idea, nor the invention of a new
device, nor the development of a new market. The process is all these
things acting in an integrated fashion.” Developing an ecosystem, if you
will, where fresh ideas and perspectives brew a technology push and a
market pull at just the right moments to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOKRR9sYlzc"&gt;increase the awesome&lt;/a&gt; across
the board. As we delved into what that meant for our groups and
organizations, we quickly saw how many facets and connotations these
ideas had - and how different they could be in&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of available material on innovation at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is plainly
overwhelming. [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; powers innovation that creates new jobs, new
markets, and new technologies.][] (Absolutely.) [We talk about ways &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
encourages and sometimes discourages innovation.][] (It can be true.
Check out the video linked at the end.) Most people think about &lt;a href="http://spinoff.nasa.gov/"&gt;spin
offs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-07/ten-tech-innovations-nasas-space-shuttle-trickled-down-non-astronauts"&gt;technology innovations&lt;/a&gt;, Tang and memory foam and a
number of other items (some of which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; had nothing to do with, by the
way.) Then there are cool projects like &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/summer/home/index.html"&gt;Summer of Innovation&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/NASA"&gt;Innovation Pavilions&lt;/a&gt; and early-stage i&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/index.html"&gt;nnovation development.&lt;/a&gt; All
valuable, vital efforts and products that make up the fabric of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
mission to pioneer the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what does innovation mean for&amp;nbsp;us? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we noted in our reflection following the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTFoaZFwjXqjcjJtr7tcH28cwD4GMglniJNvIMcg_jM/edit"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;Innovation at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; often reveals itself as a single
advancement in a specific technology. The challenge then lies in
reliably repeating the act of this advancement. We believe that
innovative practices are the key to creating and discovering
state-of-the-art technology. [We] sought to bridge the gap between
innovative technology, and its&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;In business and government, there currently exists a set of techniques
for developing new products that has been carried over from the
industrial age: a large team is pulled together, the budget is
established, a business model or project plan is created, a detailed
product road map is developed and rolled out to a user base in phases.
This process has proven itself many times over and is especially
important when building an expensive rocket – the tiniest error could
yield catastrophic failure. Much technological advancement has been made
through this process. However, these time-tested methods of management
do not lend well to seasons of uncertainty. Innovation, on the other
hand, thrives in those&amp;nbsp;seasons.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re certainly in a season of uncertainty - and it&amp;#8217;s our commitment to
lean forward into that time and cultivate the new ideas and approaches
that come in this season. The way we see it, &lt;strong&gt;innovation is grounded
in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;curiosity&lt;/strong&gt;. Asking the questions &lt;em&gt;what’s on the other side of
that?&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;what would happen if?&lt;/em&gt; opens new frontiers for us and makes
new approaches possible. Exploring where ideas take you and what
technology can do can create answers - and futures - where they may not
have existed&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we do about&amp;nbsp;it: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How does the idea of &lt;em&gt;innovation as curiosity&lt;/em&gt; shape the work we do at
open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;? There are five keys to our approach to innovation in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
policy, technology, and&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are committed to openness as the starting&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a culture that often silos organizations, divides territories, and
protects ideas, [we believe that transparency, collaboration and
participation are vital to creating&amp;nbsp;change][].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open source mindset transfers us from the innovation-resistant Not
Invented Here attitude to Proudly Found Elsewhere. The
invent-it-ourselves model is generally not sustainable, and it is
inarguably true that the best ideas for any organization are often found
outside of it. In the information age, I have to look for the best ideas
regardless of where they come from and find ways to apply them in my&amp;nbsp;context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without openness, this multidirectional flow of ideas is all but&amp;nbsp;impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We look to build extremely diverse and agile&amp;nbsp;teams.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Jobs wrote in 1996: “A lot of people in our industry haven’t had
very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and
they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on
the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience,
the better design we will&amp;nbsp;have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of filling a slot, we want to develop a person.  In our
experience the former might get the job done, but the latter
accomplishes the mission – and they do that with “a lot of dots to
connect.” They might be designers, technologists, teachers, scientists,
developers or any other number of things. We currently have backgrounds
in business administration, computer science, aerospace engineering,
languages and cultures, interaction design, public policy, and
biotechnology - and that diversity enables exponentially more robust
problem solving. I have heard our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; Center Director share many times
about how the astronaut corps changed when it went from mostly military
fighter pilots to including doctors, teachers, engineers, scientists and
others who were trained differently - and brought a different
perspective to an&amp;nbsp;issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We focus on removing obstacles to&amp;nbsp;innovation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of real obstacles, including funding, tech transfer
constraints, and lack of freedom to collaborate (usually due to
well-intentioned regulations). We spend the time learning what the
regulations are and how to apply them appropriately, searching for
funding alternatives, creating alternative opportunities for
collaboration. We work in &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/04/collaborating-virtually-in-a-physical-world/"&gt;collaborative spaces&lt;/a&gt;, approaching
everything from &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/07/28/working-outside-the-box-at-johnson-space-center-a-cross-post-from-ask-magazine/"&gt;facilities&lt;/a&gt; to meeting structure and &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/03/28/the-space-to-collaborate-the-space-to-share/"&gt;knowledge
management&lt;/a&gt; with&amp;nbsp;flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be frustrating. But it&amp;#8217;s totally worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are committed to opportunities for mass&amp;nbsp;collaborations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovative organizations don’t work in isolation. One of the hardest
things about working in government is that it’s often hard to
collaborate with others outside government; you have to know what you
are going to do in order to put agreements in place to do it – which is
often antithetical to the kind of creative work we want to encourage. We
are a small team and can’t possibly have all the experiences in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tapping into others&amp;#8217; experience and expertise, though, is something we
can do. Mass collaboration is the engagement of a broad group of diverse
participants in collective action toward a specific outcome. Government,
private companies, community initiatives and non-profit organizations
are all experimenting with creating value for themselves and their
stakeholders through mass collaboration.  With &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;hackathons&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/22apr_zooniverse/"&gt;crowd-sourced data analysis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/AA_4-4_AI_interview_jon_verville.html"&gt;wiki communities&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov/project/"&gt;open platform
development&lt;/a&gt; and crowd-funded enterprises becoming more commonplace,
mass collaboration is no longer a novel experiment.  It is an &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/03/14/coding-for-better-government/"&gt;essential
engagement tool&lt;/a&gt; already being utilized effectively across the world
in directly mission-relevant&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is focused on making these mass collaboration opportunities as
available and as effective as possible for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and our core mission&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are committed to telling the&amp;nbsp;story. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Iacocca famously said that &amp;#8220;You can have brilliant ideas, but if you
can’t get them across, your ideas won’t get you anywhere.&amp;#8221; Telling the
story has to be a priority - especially in times of uncertainty. We
spend time asking questions and cultivating new ideas - and then
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/"&gt;writing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume5/5-2_openNASA_accessible.html"&gt;speaking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/nasa"&gt;storytelling&lt;/a&gt; everywhere we&amp;nbsp;can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Walt Disney noted, “We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and
doing new things, because we&amp;#8217;re curious and curiosity keeps leading us
down new paths.” We&amp;#8217;re following &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html"&gt;Curiosity&lt;/a&gt; across Mars to see what
we can see, and I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure it&amp;#8217;s more than we can yet&amp;nbsp;imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about the next planet? And the next solar system? And the next&amp;nbsp;generation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does innovation mean for you and for your&amp;nbsp;organization? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One by one I begin configuring the communication tools that have proven
invaluable when recruiting and retaining volunteers for the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/pineapple-project/"&gt;Pineapple
Project&lt;/a&gt;, a personal interest originally developed for the April 2012
&lt;a href="spaceappschallenge.org:"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.  Just five months later the
challenge is being prepped to be rerun for its 3^rd^ hackathon along
with sister project &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/growers-nation/"&gt;Grower’s Nation&lt;/a&gt;, conceived 5000 miles away in&amp;nbsp;London.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Continue&amp;nbsp;Hacking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there is life after the Space Apps Challenge.   A highly
complex, evolving life with dynamic needs demanding technologies,
skillsets and solutions much bigger than one person and one codeathon.  
Which is exciting.  And admittedly, at times incredibly frustrating, as
we struggle to navigate data dead ends, the challenges (pun intended) of
hacking across time zones and the naivety associated with attempting to
solve a problem related to a pressing social issue in 48 hours. But we
do it, again and again, and yet&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the need for mass collaboration and big data to mitigate global
food security concerns is real. And because we were inspired by &lt;a href="rhok.org"&gt;Random
Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt; (RHoK) and the Space Apps Challenge where we
watched in amazement as Francisco &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Hanna from Chile bought a domain and
designed an outstanding user interface, supplemented by an Android App
that “Los Tainos” of Santo Domingo poured their soul into as Dan,
Venkat, and others from San Francisco managed solutions to be paired
with an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; capability all while a group of talented individuals from
the &lt;a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/"&gt;MetOffice &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; supported a common database and developed the
Galactic Award winning Grower’s Nation solution.  It is the community
that keeps us developing, and the possibility of getting one step closer
to having a working prototype to address a rather impossible challenge
in a single&amp;nbsp;weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, robust solutions to complex issues like food security require
expert insights and access to well-organized, accurate datasets. 
Unfortunately finding these repositories has been the biggest obstacle
we have encountered when designing apps contingent on large information
banks such as those linking crop and climate variables.   For this
reason, we are eager to participate this weekend in &lt;a href="http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/Hacking4Hunger"&gt;Hacking for&amp;nbsp;Hunger.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hacking for&amp;nbsp;Hunger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="http://www.opendatainitiative.org/"&gt;Open Data Initiative&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Government&amp;#8217;s
broader commitment to food security, transparency, and innovation,
&lt;a href="http://www.usaid.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has launched the &lt;a href="idea.usaid.gov:tags:food-security-open-data-challenge"&gt;Food Security Open Data Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to
convene food security stakeholders, data technologists, and other
development enthusiasts to build innovative solutions for food security.
The Challenge builds on a number of Administration priorities with a
goal to develop new applications that use and build robust data relevant
to food security, to demonstrate within and outside of government the
potential of open data and social innovators in development, and to
ensure that government serves as a platform for fomenting&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackathon component of the challenge, Hacking for Hunger, will be
kicked off Sept 14^th^ by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; Administrator Raj Shah and will provide
a platform for participants to collaborate virtually to create new or to
join existing teams to finalize solutions for an expert panel of
judges.  The best projects (and presenters) will join &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; in Des
Moines to speak at the &lt;a href="http://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/events/iowa_hunger_summit/"&gt;Iowa Hunger Summit&lt;/a&gt; on World Hunger Day,
October 16th 2012 and will be invited to participate in the week-long
&lt;a href="http://www.worldfoodprize.org/"&gt;World Food Prize&lt;/a&gt; and Bourlag Dialogue events.  So far, six projects
have been proposed for the challenge. You can learn more about the
challenges, or start your own at
&lt;a href="http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/challengequestion"&gt;http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/challengequestion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;Participate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because as we learned from the International Space Challenge &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; RHoK;
your code, your hacks and your solutions have the potential to
facilitate a community of users &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; contributors that endure well beyond
one codeathon.  And that’s pretty&amp;nbsp;cool.&lt;/p&gt;

Marshall
Spaceflight Center&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/vonbraun.html"&gt;Dr. Wernher von Braun&lt;/a&gt; showed him a model
of the Saturn C-5 rocket, the “vehicle designed to fulfill your promise
to put a man on the moon by the end of this decade.” The next day, in an
&lt;a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/JFK-Speeches/Address-at-Rice-University-on-the-Nations-Space-Effort-September-12-1962.aspx"&gt;audacious speech at Rice University&lt;/a&gt;, the president marshaled the
nation’s resolve to accomplish just&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not
because they are easy, but because they are hard…&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The times were uncertain. Differences between the United States and the
Soviet Union played out in a cold war that was a constant presence,
propelling the intense rivalry that resulted in &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/people/galleries/armstrong.html"&gt;Neil Armstrong’s&lt;/a&gt;
iconic moment as the first human to step on to the surface of the&amp;nbsp;Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to&amp;nbsp;win&amp;#8230;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy’s speech became the pivot for the development of the technology
necessary to achieve his goals in the unforgiving and harsh frontier of&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass
destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and&amp;nbsp;understanding.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it led to cooperation, and the realization that the &lt;em&gt;promise
of rapidly emerging technology can only be fully realized through
collaboration.&lt;/em&gt;Today, six humans from three different countries are
living and working onboard the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; and serve
as ambassadors of all people of Earth. I was personally affected from
the technology that grew out of President Kennedy’s speech when I had
the privilege of traveling to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; twice, launching in 2008 as part
of an international crew onboard the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/discovery-info.html"&gt;American Space Shuttle
Discovery&lt;/a&gt;, and then launching in 2011 as part of an international
crew onboard a &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/soyuz/"&gt;Russian Soyuz spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;. During the 164 days of my
second mission, I spent much of my free time&lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/106819891249477893372/photos/116214152295449083654/albums/5648104889925481025"&gt;documenting what I saw 250
miles below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I looked back at our home, I faced the sobering contradiction of the
incredible beauty of our planet with the unfortunate realities of life
for a significant number of Earth’s inhabitants. I launched into space
with the belief that we have sufficient technology and resources to
solve many, if not all, the problems facing our planet. During my time
in space I often found myself contemplating the question, if we have
ample technology and resources to solve problems facing our world, why
do so many problems remain? I tried to capture what I believe is the
answer to this question in this&amp;nbsp;video:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/49293284?byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" width="500" height="281"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/49293284"&gt;Unity Node&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/fragileoasis"&gt;Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/benefits/index.html"&gt;technological benefits&lt;/a&gt; provided by the space program and
international cooperation are such an integral part of our daily lives
on Earth, it is hard to comprehend just how bold President Kennedy’s
challenge to go to Moon was 50 years ago. Think about it, we had barley
stuck our toe in the ocean of space, we had not even learned to stand,
yet but we were going to&amp;nbsp;sprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the
moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant
rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made
of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable
of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been
experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest
watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance,
control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an
unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, re-entering
the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat
about half that of the temperature of the sun&amp;#8212;almost as hot as it is
here today&amp;#8212;and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before
this decade is out&amp;#8212;then we must be&amp;nbsp;bold.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problems facing us all today require the same boldness that was
required to reach the Moon and return to Earth safely. Fifty years ago,
before President Kennedy left Marshall Spaceflight Center for Rice
University, Dr. Braun turned to him and said, “By God, we’ll do&amp;nbsp;it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solving the problems facing our world requires that we all stand
together and refuse to accept the status quo on our planet. It requires
that we all commit to work together so that our planet is not only
visibly beautiful, but a planet where life is also beautiful for all. In
the spirit of boldness that brought humans to another world, let us all
work hard to set aside our differences and work together toward our
common&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to
die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said,
&amp;#8220;Because it is there.&amp;#8221; Well, space is there, and we&amp;#8217;re going to climb
it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge
and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God&amp;#8217;s
blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on
which man has ever embarked.”&lt;/em&gt; President John F.&amp;nbsp;Kennedy&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="fragile oasis"></category><category term="Inspiration"></category><category term="JFK"></category><category term="Moon"></category></entry><entry><title>NASA is nominated for a Makey!</title><link href="/nasa-is-nominated-for-a-makey" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-09-06T10:11:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Brian McLaughlin</name></author><id>tag:,2012-09-06:nasa-is-nominated-for-a-makey</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a growing movement around the world based off an old, very
simple, idea. The idea is that you can do it yourself, whatever &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8221; may
be. This has existed as part of the Do-It-Yourself, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;, ideal for a
very long time with crafters, artisans, and weekend warriors of all
types. As we continue our footsteps into the early part of the 21st
century that ideal is evolving into the Maker movement. Last week, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
was nominated for a prestigious award within the Maker movement, a &lt;a href="http://makezine.com/makeys/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAKE&lt;/span&gt;
Magazine Industry Maker Award&lt;/a&gt;, known as a&amp;nbsp;Makey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award is given by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MAKE&lt;/span&gt; Magazine to individuals and groups that show
&amp;#8220;outstanding support for independent Maker/Hacker culture&amp;#8221;. The nominee
announcement process began at the Bay Area Maker Faire this past May and
the winners will be announced at the &lt;a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/index.html"&gt;World Maker Faire&lt;/a&gt; in New York
at the end of this&amp;nbsp;month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is, of course, incredibly honored to be nominated by the public for
a Makey and then to be selected out of the pool of nominees for the
final sixteen slots. Outreach to the public and bringing the work that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; does in aeronautics and space exploration to open minds is an
important part of what we do as an Agency. The kind words and accolades
in the announcement speak for themselves but the real honor, to this
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; engineer, is the &lt;a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/08/30/makey-awards-2012-nominee-09-nasa-education/"&gt;final nomination statement&lt;/a&gt; in the&amp;nbsp;announcement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For lifting so many young eyes upward, toward the stars, and for doing
so much to keep them there, we are proud to welcome &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to the running
for the 2012 Makey&amp;nbsp;Awards.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you to all of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; supporters and enthusiasts around the world
and to the Makey team for nominating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; for this prestigious award in

and open source tools. The &lt;a href="http://mapbox.com/blog/2012-08-26-mapping-mars/"&gt;results&lt;/a&gt; are pretty spectacular, along
with the story of how he did it. &lt;a href="http://hrwgc.github.com/planets/"&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; where you can explore more
of Mars yourself with open planetary data. This is what openness is all
about: what the data can make possible, how it can engage you, pull you
in. What could you build with the live data and images from Mars? How
could it stir people&amp;#8217;s imagination about&amp;nbsp;exploration?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Mars data can be found &lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=15"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - and we&amp;#8217;d love to see what you&amp;nbsp;create.&lt;/p&gt;

took place.  We are currently in the process of planning a number of
future mass collaboration events and in reflecting back on what we
learned over the past six months, I wanted to share a few words from the
introduction to the &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/QR3Em"&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt; for the International Space Apps
Challenge.  It really addresses why innovation is so important, why it&amp;#8217;s
so often bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable, and why it&amp;#8217;s
so different the normal way we do&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does it really mean to&amp;nbsp;innovate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; often reveals itself as a single advancement in a
specific technology. The challenge then lies in reliably repeating the
act of this advancement. We believe that innovative practices are the
key to creating and discovering state-of-the-art technology. The
International Space Apps Challenge sought to bridge the gap between
innovative technology, and its&amp;nbsp;practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In business and government, there currently exists a set of techniques
for developing new products that has been carried over from the
industrial age: a large team is pulled together, the budget is
established, a business model or project plan is created, a detailed
product road map is developed and rolled out to a user base in phases.
This process has proven itself many times over and is especially
important when building an expensive rocket – the tiniest error could
yield catastrophic failure. Much technological advancement has been
made through this process. However, these time-tested methods of
management do not lend well to seasons of uncertainty. Innovation, on
the other hand, thrives in those&amp;nbsp;seasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation is bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable. True
innovation necessitates failure. The more you experiment, the more you
fail, the more you learn. Small technologies and initial development
deserve innovative process and the opportunity for&amp;nbsp;failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the International Space Apps Challenge we opened up challenges of
space exploration and social need and empowered citizens around the
world to solve those challenges. This was a bold risk. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; partnered
with organizations with whom they had not previously partnered. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
empowered local planners in 24 cities around the world, with the
vision for contributing to space exploration and social good.
Passionate citizens were asked to find and share their solutions to
the challenges. In the process of planning, executing and concluding
the event we have learned a lot; and recognized the power released
when we work together with others committed to changing the way the
world works. With that in mind, this report is to share our
experience. We experimented with a model for accelerating technology
and have captured that story here to be built upon. We hope that
business and government alike can carry the story&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://github.com/WhiteHouse/petition"&gt;We The People&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;, the popular e-petitions platform that powers
&lt;a href="http://petitions.whitehouse.gov"&gt;petitions.whitehouse.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s great to see other organizations in the government participating in
the open source movement and releasing their code with the goal of
engaging the public, improving the services they offer, and encouraging
the sharing of public resources. As you may know, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has been
extremely active in the open source community. Our open source hub,
&lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov"&gt;code.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, currently lists dozens of open source projects at the
agency, and our &lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa"&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt; hosts 11 public repositories (including
the most recent, our &lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa/digital-strategy"&gt;digital strategy&lt;/a&gt;). We&amp;#8217;re also big users of open
source projects, such as &lt;a href="http://nginx.org/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"&gt;Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt;. In
June of this year, we held our second successful &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/summit/"&gt;Open Source Summit&lt;/a&gt;
(this time at the University of&amp;nbsp;Maryland).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been keeping a close eye on the We The People platform for possible
uses at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and now that it&amp;#8217;s just a one-click fork away, it will be
even easier to deploy if we find ourselves needing the functionality it
provides. Kudos to the White House for joining the open source community
on&amp;nbsp;Github!&lt;/p&gt;

exploration began airing. Not a novel subject for the 1960’s; however,
it was set apart by the ship’s crew, who at the time were as fictional
as the fantastic voyages undertaken. The plot depicted Americans and
Russians working together at the height of the Cold War; men, women and
people of different races working together as equals at a time when that
was far outside of the norm in much of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Star Trek’s original cast members, George Takei, remarked during
a visit to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Johnson Space Center that our world has (partially)
caught up to the fictional one he starred in and I tend to agree. While
the International Space Station (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;) is not travelling the galaxy at
warp speed making contact with new alien species, it is an incredibly
complex engineering feat undertaken by nations from around the globe,
two of the major partners being former Cold War rivals. The
multinational crew living and working on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; is comprised of men and
women from these countries that train together, learn each other’s
languages and have dedicated their lives to furthering the common goal
of space exploration for the good of all&amp;nbsp;mankind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discoveries being made possible by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; are giving the world a
treasure trove of information on the intricacies of long duration space
flight; both on the effects of the harsh space environment that the crew
endures and the machines needed to sustain them. It is also providing a
wealth of information through experiments with Earth applications, as
well as observations of the Earth below and the infinitely deep space&amp;nbsp;above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a privilege to work in the strategic planning team, where I
got the chance to see this cooperation firsthand. I had the opportunity
to be a part of a team planning &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; logistic support after Shuttle
retirement alongside all of the international partners. I also had the
opportunity to work with many systems experts and our partners to
determine the impacts of possible module relocations, new research
module integration and new ports for the next generation of crew
vehicles that will help this amazing platform remain in orbit long into
the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I firmly believe that humanity’s next great ventures into space
exploration will be international. So far, space has not had an owner.
It belongs to all of mankind and bringing countries together to expand
man’s last frontier brings us all closer together as we look down on the
tiny blue speck and out at the infinite universe around us. Think of how
the Apollo-Soyuz and Mir projects thawed the ice, even so slightly,
between the two countries involved despite the fact that at the time
they were pledging mutual&amp;nbsp;annihilation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by my role supporting the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;, I hope to remain a part of the
fantastic and boundless field of international space exploration after I
finish my graduate degree, which will hopefully not only give me a
better understanding of aerospace engineering, but also of the way
business is conducted overseas and long term relationships are built
between governments, agencies and&amp;nbsp;businesses.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Engineers without Borders"></category><category term="I am NASA"></category><category term="international"></category><category term="ISS"></category></entry><entry><title>Vote for #Space at @SxSW</title><link href="/vote-for-space-at-sxsw" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-08-14T14:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-08-14:vote-for-space-at-sxsw</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We need your help!&lt;/em&gt; There are a number of exciting space-related panels
proposed for next year’s &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive"&gt;South by Southwest&lt;/a&gt; festival in Austin. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;
is a community-driven event and voting accounts for 30% of the
decision-making process for any given programming slot. The selection
process is extremely competitive and this year there are 3600 proposed
panels, of which only 500 get selected. The more votes we submit for the
space panels, the more likely a panel related to space exploration will
be included in the final SxSW program. Voting ends on Friday, August 31
(11:59 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CST&lt;/span&gt;), so please vote &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you out, we’ve put together a directory for all the space
related panels. This includes panels that have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; representation as
well others that may not necessarily be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;affiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of software would you design to support astronauts aboard a
space station? Well, in this session, we&amp;#8217;ll show you. We are two &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
designers who want to share a little about what we do, the situations we
design for, and where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UX&lt;/span&gt; in space is heading. Here&amp;#8217;s a few of the topics
we&amp;#8217;ll talk&amp;nbsp;about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of user experience in space. In the Apollo and Shuttle
eras, most things happened on paper. And, for better or worse, many of
the design strategies they used in their notebooks with are still in use&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state of art aboard the Space Station. Crew members currently rely
on a bevy of acronym loaded tools (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSTPV&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IPV&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCAMS&lt;/span&gt;) to do their job.
We&amp;#8217;ll take a look at what these tools&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s next. If you watched the attached video, you know there&amp;#8217;s room
for improvement. We&amp;#8217;re rethinking the software experience both aboard
the station and in mission control. Our hope is simple: to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
software cool again. We&amp;#8217;ll give you a sneak&amp;nbsp;peek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ask the astronauts via a live video downlink directly from the
International Space Station about using technology to communicate with
us down here on Earth. The nation&amp;#8217;s space agency has embraced the use of
social media to reach out, engaging new audiences in new ways and giving
people behind-the-scenes access to areas rarely seen by the public.
Communicating from space is no exception to this pattern of openness. By
using tweets, blog posts and streamed video interviews with groups
across the world, the astronauts living and working on orbit have a
unique vantage point in which to conduct science-altering experiments,
encourage the next generation to study &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; in school and to open a door
that rekindles the dreamer in all of us. Communicate directly with some
of the astronauts aboard the space station during this panel and explore
all the ways that you can connect with what&amp;#8217;s going on way up there from
all the way down&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4251"&gt;Apollo 13: America&amp;#8217;s First Galactic&amp;nbsp;Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was April of 1970. Apollo 13 was going to be the third space mission
to land on the moon. But on its way, nearly two hundred thousand miles
from home and hours away from landing on the Moon, an explosion occurred
on the spacecraft that changed history. Teams in Mission Control had to
respond quickly to save the crew - and hopefully the mission. Apollo 13
was the world’s first galactic hackathon. Although some of the most
brilliant minds in the country were working on these problems, with so
many factors that could go wrong, many felt the crew would not be coming
home. Some observers gave the crew a one in 10 chance of survival. The
mission was not easy&amp;#8230; but in a very short amount of time, and against
all odds, collaborative teams of engineers, developers and subject
matter experts invented the technology to return the crew safely to
earth. Join us for a discussion about America’s first galactic hackathon
and explore the leadership lessons from Apollo’s failed&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/5183"&gt;Get Physical: Making Space Data Real on&amp;nbsp;Earth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of us dream about space exploration - but haven&amp;#8217;t yet touched those
stars ourselves. Can earth science and other open data connect us
physically and personally to the exploration of the universe? It could
be that the Space Station is overhead; it could be that a solar storm
has exceeded a threshold; or that in space it is very very cold. Can we
adorn and decorate our lives with what we&amp;#8217;ve learned from space? Can we
bring data close to us to engage us physically in far-off exploration-
and let those interactions to change our digital lives? We&amp;#8217;ll look at a
variety of real space data and the international, cross-disciplinary
collaborations that can discover its secrets. There is a certain thrill
that you feel when you know that you are connected to something. From
our earliest use of technology to synchronize and connect communities we
have used simple interactions and design to inform people, providing
connections to things and places beyond ourselves. Let&amp;#8217;s see what&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​5. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/5785"&gt;Making it to&amp;nbsp;Mars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, humans, will go to Mars. Depending on who you ask, it may be in 20
years, or 200. The Mars shot of tomorrow will not look like the Moon
shot of yesterday. The future necessitates a much tighter balance of
human-centered design, technological prowess, and social
responsibility. With the panelists, we invite you to explore this living
network, engage in an ongoing discussion of design in space, hone your

&lt;p&gt;​6. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6513"&gt;The Explorer Next Door: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, Women and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This panel is about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;: The student, retiree, hobbyist, underdog,
and/or dreamer donating time, resources, and creativity to explore the
unknown. Instead of describing opportunities available for women to
engage with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, this conversation will feature a diverse selection of
space geeks and citizen scientists who will share personal successes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
failures as they break barriers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; stereotypes in order to better
understand the world around us. Sure, there might be an astronaut,
engineer and a few &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees in attendance, but the discussion and
purpose of this panel is to connect female makers, problem solvers, and
hackers with the needs and people of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUR&lt;/span&gt; Agency. To sustain dialogue,
attendees will be invited to an exclusive post-event TweetUp to address
participatory exploration questions. Participants will also be
encouraged to share imagery for a tool that will be launched in time for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt; featuring women citizen scientists on the Women@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6687"&gt;Startup &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tired of the constant stream of buzzwords and platitudes thrown around
organizations in an attempt to create a sense of innovation and
intrapreneurship? Do new ideas, bold endeavors, and a spirit of
adventure sound more exciting than a corporate retreat to discuss
upcoming performance metrics? Three years ago, a small group of
unconventional thinkers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; gathered together with a simple goal -
to change the way we look at exploration of the universe and to take the
best of startup culture and implant it in a large, traditional
government&amp;nbsp;bureaucracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear from some of these thinkers about their thoughts on organizational
culture change, the future of the Nation&amp;#8217;s space program, and discuss
how you, too, can be a exploration trailblazer in your&amp;nbsp;organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6687"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4900"&gt;Crowdsourcing the Space&amp;nbsp;Frontier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space promises enormous opportunities to those who first explore it. Can
we all be part of this endeavor? Will you be part of&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the arrival of the crowd-sourcing and open-source movements, never
before have humans had the opportunity to transform and build entire
industries in such short time frames and with mass participation. We
have seen Linux, Firefox, Wikipedia and millions of app developers
demonstrate this in the software world. With the arrival of the Makers
movement and recent initiatives to crowd-source, crowd-fund and
open-source space technology we may be seeing this same trend in space.
This session explores the history, opportunities and challenges for
entrepreneurs, companies, nonprofits and governments wishing to lead the
way in this unexpected frontier. Help us answer: Why is this trend
happening? Is it here to stay? Is it viable? Can we create a
collaborative global space industry? Who, if anyone, will emerge as the
primary catalysts for this&amp;nbsp;industry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4900"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​9. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3025"&gt;News&amp;nbsp;2.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional media is slowly transforming. Reporters and beats are being
cut. Newsrooms are being trimmed back. Is it time to kill the press
release? Is it time to shift your news release paradigm to be digital
products first? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; invites public affairs and new media professionals
to join us for an engaging exchange of ideas about how to continue
spreading the word about your organizations&amp;#8217; programs, mission and
projects, given the realities of the modern media market. We&amp;#8217;ve been
experimenting in this changing media landscape, and we want to hear your
thoughts and ideas about the future of communications going forward. The
rise of web technologies and social media engagement have forever
altered the relationship between organizations&amp;#8217;, the media that have
previously spread their news, and the audiences you are trying to reach
&amp;#8212; so how do you continue to do this&amp;nbsp;effectively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3025"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3578"&gt;The Hacker’s Guide to the&amp;nbsp;Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t panic: the next big science revolution isn&amp;#8217;t just for asteroid
miners or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt; scientists. Just as science fiction has often shown the
way to future inventions, the act of hacking is now generating
prototypes that act as footholds for future explorations, discoveries
and epiphanies in science. This presentation takes you on a tour of our
universe (from black holes and dark matter to exoplanets and the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence) and shows you how you can actively
explore the final frontier through getting excited and making&amp;nbsp;things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3578"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​11. [The Death of .gov and the Rise of Diverse&amp;nbsp;Engagement ][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology in government isn&amp;#8217;t just about putting up a new .gov website,
or creating a new platform - it can&amp;#8217;t be, because the public demands
better services where they already are engaging, and they need these
services now. This panel will get to the bottom of not just the future
of citizen engagement, but the movement to deliver on the promise of
open source, mobile citizen engagement right now by any means&amp;nbsp;necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /&gt;][The Death of .gov and the Rise of Diverse&amp;nbsp;Engagement ]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/10152"&gt;12. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;INTERNET&lt;/span&gt;, I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;! A &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Rover Lands&amp;nbsp;Online&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tweet that will live in infamy, &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GALE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CRATER&lt;/span&gt;, I &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8221; heralded a
new era of space exploration and conversation between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the
general public. As the Curiosity Mars rover touched down on the Red
Planet, the teams at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were sharing
the historic event on Twitter, Facebook, Ustream, YouTube, Google+, Xbox
Live, mobile apps and in-real-life landing parties. The Mars Science
Laboratory mission propelled the interest and attention of the nation
back onto the space program — all while competing against the London
Olympics and the presidential campaign. And what the public saw was a
hipper, more accessible &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; — one that generated an avalanche of memes
from Unimpressed Curiosity to Mohawk Guy. What went on behind the scenes
with this campaign that helped &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; capture the public&amp;#8217;s attention, and
can &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; keep the interest and excitement&amp;nbsp;going?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/10152"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s exciting to see that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has so much more than just space
exploration to share, but that we are truly pushing boundaries in
communication, engagement and technology development. Can&amp;#8217;t wait to see

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s plans, programs and priorities, in a study directed by Congress
and led by the National Academies. This is your space program and your
future. What do you have to say about&amp;nbsp;it? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FY2012&lt;/span&gt; appropriations bill that funds &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, Congress requested an
independent study of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s strategic direction. The study is being
conducted by a committee of the &lt;a href="http://nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.html"&gt;National Research Council&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study &lt;a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/ASEB/DEPS_067029"&gt;statement of task&lt;/a&gt; directs the committee to &amp;#8220;recommend how
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; could establish and effectively communicate a common, unifying
vision for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s strategic direction that encompasses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s varied
missions.&amp;#8221; Strategic direction can be thought of as the steps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; needs
to take over time to accomplish its vision and&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Strategic Direction Committee is reviewing a large amount of
published material, including the law that created &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; (the National
Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, most recently amended in 2010) and
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocfo/budget/strat_plans.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s 2011 Strategic Plan&lt;/a&gt;, which begins with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s statement of
its vision and&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; vision is &amp;#8220;to reach for new heights and reveal the
unknown, so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind&amp;#8221;, and
its mission is to &amp;#8220;drive advances in science, technology, and
exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic
vitality, and stewardship of Earth.&amp;#8221; The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Strategic Plan also states
that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s current direction lays &amp;#8220;the groundwork for a sustainable
program of exploration and innovation. This new direction extends the
life of the International Space Station, supports the growing commercial
space industry, and addresses important scientific challenges while
continuing our commitment to robust human space exploration, science,
and aeronautics&amp;nbsp;programs.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Directions Committee is listening to a wide variety of
experts in aeronautics and space science and technology, space policy
and programs, and communications strategy, and it wants to hear from
other stakeholders, including the public, as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee invites your responses to the nine questions listed

Mars Science Lab Atlas V Launch - 26 November,&amp;nbsp;2011[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone was really excited for the landing on Mars Science Lab (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;)
Sunday night. I worked for the Launch Services Program as the trajectory
analyst for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;. The landing was exciting for me because, even though
the Atlas V launch vehicle and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft separated eight and a half
months ago, this journey to the surface of Mars is one the rocket put it
on. The landing place and the time of landing is what dictates where and
when the spacecraft is dropped off by the&amp;nbsp;rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you and your best friend decide, Saturday morning, August 4,
you want to drive from Kennedy Space Center to New York City to see the
Mars Science Lab landing broadcast live in Times Square on Sunday night
(August 6, 1:31am &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDT&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;300&amp;#8221;]&lt;img alt="" src="http://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/57000/57821/EastCoast.A2002059.1555.500m.jpg" /&gt; East Coast of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt;
- Kennedy Space Center in Florida to New York&amp;nbsp;City[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to decide if you want to get there on&amp;nbsp;Sunday&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at 3pm to catch a Broadway&amp;nbsp;matinee&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at 7pm for&amp;nbsp;dinner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at 11pm when the coverage&amp;nbsp;starts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;at 1am just before&amp;nbsp;landing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have figure out where you’re going to park your car, and then if
you’re going to walk or take a taxi or the subway to Times&amp;nbsp;Square.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;nbsp;could&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave early Sunday morning and drive straight&amp;nbsp;through&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave Saturday and stay in a&amp;nbsp;hotel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;leave Saturday and stay at your cousin Vinny’s house in&amp;nbsp;Virginia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have to decide on which highways you want to take based on a metric
(i.e. the fewest tolls or fastest time). The route might include a quick
side trip to the beach (assuming the beach is on the Atlantic Ocean; go
to the Pacific Ocean and you probably won’t make it in time). You have
to give yourself margin for bathroom breaks, food breaks, and, of
course,&amp;nbsp;traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These all factor into when you leave Florida. Because you only get one
shot to be in Times Square when Curiosity tells us she’s reached the
surface of&amp;nbsp;Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing a trajectory to Mars isn’t exactly the same, but you have to
make a lot of tradeoffs and build in margin, just like your road trip to
New York. One of the biggest determents when going to Mars is that,
every 26 months, the orbits of Mars and Earth line up for the fastest,
lowest energy trajectory to Mars. If you miss that opportunity, like we
did in 2009, you have to wait for the next&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/slideshows/show01/br_s01-07.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trajectory design is easiest when you can launch the same trajectory,
regardless of time or day. That was not the case for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;. When you go to
another planet or &lt;a href="http://atrain.nasa.gov/"&gt;join a train of other spacecraft&lt;/a&gt; or if the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sdo/main/index.html"&gt;sun is
a factor&lt;/a&gt;, you have to &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/launchingrockets/launchwindows.html"&gt;adjust your trajectory for each day and time
you could launch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were multiple designs of trajectories to Mars. And each design
needed to be run for 5-9 times for each day, depending on how close to
launch we were. There was a 24 day launch period, so United Launch
Alliance (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ULA&lt;/span&gt;: Atlas V launch vehicle provider) had to create hundreds
of trajectories for each&amp;nbsp;design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that affects the design is the landing site. The &lt;a href="http://msl-scicorner.jpl.nasa.gov/landingsiteselection/"&gt;landing site
wasn’t chosen until August 2011&lt;/a&gt;, but we had to start modeling
trajectories years beforehand. So we had to be ready for landing sites
in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere, and near the
equator of&amp;nbsp;Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;461&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="" src="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/images/20081124a/MSL_4sites_globe.jpg" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/news/images/20081124a/MSL_4sites_globe.jpg"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt; The landing
sites with white text show the final four landing sites in the selection
process. Gale Crater was the selected&amp;nbsp;site.[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another design element is that trajectories work differently based on
whether, on your way to Mars, you go more or less than halfway around
the sun; it’s one or the other, based on what day you launch. Mars
Climate Orbiter had a &lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msp98/orbiter/cruise.html"&gt;Type &lt;span class="caps"&gt;II&lt;/span&gt; trajectory&lt;/a&gt;; Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter, like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;, had a &lt;a href="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/cruise/images/mro-trajectory.jpg"&gt;Type I trajectory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landing on Mars is incredibly risky, with a 40% success rate. So you
want to be able to have data for the entire journey through the
atmosphere. That way, if something goes wrong, you know when in the
descent it happened. And even if you’re successful, the data will help
with planning the next&amp;nbsp;landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;392&amp;#8221;]&lt;img alt="" src="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/images/Scoreboard_1488x1080-hpfeat.jpg" /&gt; Mars Mission
Success Rate (for all missions; not just&amp;nbsp;landers)[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What day and time you plan on landing is going to affect whether the
Mars orbiters are directly overhead and available to collect the data
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;, or if the Earth is in view and we might be able to do Direct
to Earth communication. Both methods utilize the &lt;a href="http://deepspace.jpl.nasa.gov/dsn/"&gt;Deep Space Network&lt;/a&gt;.
Ideally, you get both the entire time you descend, but that’s another&amp;nbsp;tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With orbiters, you have to worry that, between deciding to depend on
them and the time you land, something could happen to the orbiter and it
isn’t available. With direct to Earth communication, we can’t get as
much data during landing as when we go via the&amp;nbsp;orbiters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;200&amp;#8221;]&lt;img alt="" src="http://marsoweb.nas.nasa.gov/HiRISE/images/MRO_250.jpg" /&gt; Mars
Reconnaissance&amp;nbsp;Orbiter[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now sometimes you decide to leave a certain time to start the road trip,
but something happens and the plan changes. You get 20 minutes away from
your house and you realize the video camera is on the kitchen counter.
You go back to get it and take out the side trip to Jekyll Island State
Park in Georgia. May be halfway through the trip, you realize you’re
ahead of schedule and so you stop at a sit down restaurant instead of a
fast food restaurant as originally planned for&amp;nbsp;lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like you make adjustments to the trip, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; had six trajectory
correction maneuvers (TCMs) scheduled for along the way for two
different reasons. The first reason is that the launch vehicle puts the
spacecraft on a trajectory aimed just a little off of Mars. This is for
&lt;a href="http://planetaryprotection.nasa.gov/"&gt;planetary protection&lt;/a&gt;; in case the spacecraft isn’t working properly
after launch/at some point during the cruise to Mars, we don’t want it
to automatically hit Mars and contaminate the planet if it won’t be able
to do science. So the TCMs gradually move the spacecraft’s aim closer to&amp;nbsp;Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;448&amp;#8221;]&lt;img alt="MSL Cruise" src="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/msl/20111213/pia14831-640.jpg" /&gt; Mars
Science Lab during the&amp;nbsp;Cruise[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason for TCMs is margin against errors. The launch vehicle
aims for a specific place to drop off the spacecraft, but the engineers
plan for bubble around that place that the spacecraft might actually end
up. Issues could come up during flight, such as the thrusters giving
more or less thrust than anticipated (this didn’t actually happen). And
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;  mission design and navigation manager for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; said &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-371"&gt;&amp;#8220;This was
among the most accurate interplanetary injections ever&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; regarding the
launch trajectory. So &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; didn’t have to use all the TCMs&amp;nbsp;planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On your trip to New York, even though both you and your best friend are
intelligent and have taken many road trips in your lifetimes, you guys
might want to stop at different restaurants or disagree on whether one
highway is quicker than the other. The engineers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; have different
ideas on what is most important when designing the route to Mars and
they have to work together to agree of the best solution for the
spacecraft. This is when the art of engineering and space travel&amp;nbsp;happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because just like you and your friend will only make this particular
trip once, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; only has one journey to&amp;nbsp;Mars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; with the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/launch_services/index.html"&gt;Launch Services Program&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSP&lt;/span&gt;) at Kennedy
Space Center. So what does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSP&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/OfficialLSPLogo_jpg-300x300.jpg" /&gt;][]  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSP&lt;/span&gt; interfaces between the rocket and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; unmanned spacecraft. The
rockets, or launch vehicles, are actually owned by companies, not &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.
So &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSP&lt;/span&gt; has to be the rocket experts for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, making sure that what
happens on the launch vehicle side is best for the spacecraft. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSP&lt;/span&gt;
selects the rocket that is the best value for the spacecraft, manages
the schedule/ budget/ contracts, observes testing, performs analyses,
and arranges for the spacecraft to be integrated with the rocket. We
work launches here in Florida, but also California, Alaska, Virginia,
and even Kwajalein Atoll in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Our
nickname is Earth’s Bridge to&amp;nbsp;Space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="broken egg" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/NES_Teachers_Corner.blog/1014816main_EggDropped.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often think of the spacecraft as an egg, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LSP&lt;/span&gt; is working to make
sure that egg doesn’t get damaged during launch: the shell doesn’t
crack, the yolk and the whites don’t mix, the egg doesn’t end up frozen
on one side and cooked on the other. I work as a guidance, navigation,
and controls flight analyst, who makes sure the egg is pointing where it
needs to, spinning if it needs to, and doesn’t hit the carton on the way
out. I also work as a trajectory analyst, who makes sure the egg ends up
unbroken in the right place, at the right time. Because if something
goes wrong during launch, these amazing spacecraft can’t collect the
data and images they were made&amp;nbsp;for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/images/msl20110519_PIA14156-br.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mars Science Laboratory (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;) was actually my first mission as a
trajectory analyst. For those of you going “What! They assigned a newbie
to a flagship mission?”, let me reassure you. An experienced analyst
worked on the mission for the first four years, and I worked as his
backup for over a year. He moved to a systems engineering program and I
took over the mission at that point. However, I worked closely with my
flight design lead on the mission; the rest of the flight design group
lent me their expertise throughout the process too. My counterparts at
the &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;Jet Propulsion Lab&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft provider) and &lt;a href="http://www.ulalaunch.com/"&gt;United
Launch Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ULA&lt;/span&gt;: Atlas V launch vehicle provider) also had lots
of experience; I was most definitely not out there on my&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When working on the trajectories, you have to work backwards. You figure
out where on Mars and at what time you want to land. For more on
planning the spacecraft’s trajectory, see my post “Taking a Road Trip to
Mars vs. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;: Tradeoffs and Margin.” The spacecraft lets the launch
vehicle know where and when it wants to be dropped off, along with how
fast it wants to be going in which direction. Using that information
along with the mass of the spacecraft, the configuration of the launch
vehicle, and the requirements of the spacecraft, the launch vehicle
trajectory can be&amp;nbsp;planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/launch_sequence_diagram-full-small.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/launch_sequence_diagram-full-small.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration of the launch vehicle indicates things like how big
the fairing is (the shell that protects the spacecraft at the top of the
rocket while going through the atmosphere) and how many solid rocket
boosters are attached to the rocket (Atlas V can have anywhere from zero
to five). The launch vehicle has different rules it has to follow, based
on the configuration. These rules are things like how long after liftoff
the rocket has to pitch over and the maximum dynamic pressure allowed
(if the rocket goes too fast while there is still atmosphere, the
pressure could break the&amp;nbsp;rocket).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="viewing the sun with protection" src="http://sunearthday.nasa.gov/2012/images/thumb_viewing.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spacecraft requirements are different for each spacecraft. Some
spacecraft have instruments that are light sensitive and, once the
fairing comes off, they can’t be pointed too close to the sun. Just
like, as humans, we can’t stare directly at the sun without risking
damaging our eyes. Some spacecraft have to be rolled if the launch takes
longer than a set amount of time; otherwise, one side of the spacecraft
will get too hot from the sun and the other side will get too cold. Some
spacecraft have to be spinning at a certain speed at separation; others
may want a little spin as possible. These are just a few rules
spacecraft may want to have during&amp;nbsp;launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In planning the trajectory of the launch vehicle, you make sure the
trajectory obeys all the “rules” of the launch vehicle and spacecraft.
Then you try to optimize the trajectory, usually for having the most
propellant leftover. This way, in case something doesn’t perform as
expected, you have extra gas to get the rocket on the correct course.
This is called margin. And it takes lots of number crunching to get that
margin as high as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="wind profile: altitude vs wind speed" src="http://atmos.pds.nasa.gov/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Huygens/DWE.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to being a trajectory analyst for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSL&lt;/span&gt;, I was also on console
as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Winds trainee. In the last few hours prior to launch, we
send up several high altitude balloons anywhere from 11 to 19 miles up.
We look for too high velocities or wind shears; wind shears are when the
wind at different altitudes are opposing or very different speeds. These
conditions can be too extreme to control the trajectory or could even
break the vehicle, so we make sure we don’t launch during those
dangerous times. The launch vehicle provider can also use the wind
profile to optimize the trajectory for that particular&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="bull's eye" src="http://kepler.nasa.gov/images/mws/bullseye1.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as I love to watch rockets launch, it’s quite a different
experience to hear the countdown on the headset, see the altitude on the
screen increase, and then a minute later feel the launch move through
you. It’s very emotional, and unbelievable when you realize the
trajectory hits its target dead on. My counterpart at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; said &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2011-371"&gt;&amp;#8220;This
was among the most accurate interplanetary injections ever.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; That’s
the proudest statement of my career so&amp;nbsp;far.&lt;/p&gt;

space enthusiast Tom Sachs. By recreating great cultural motifs out of
basic materials such as foam-core, plywood, and hot glue, Sachs
juxtaposes exterior appearance against internal value. His work, both
playful and ironic, demonstrates current trends in the ways that we
communicate, the ways in which we consume, and how “sexy” space can&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs’ most recent work, “Space Program: Mars” is a compelling exhibit,
which upon first glance is seamlessly real. However, it’s construction
isn’t hidden - it’s purposely assembled out of plywood, screws, and
glue. This work stands for itself. Inherent to space imagery,
exploration is naturally occurring beauty. Sachs installation art
demonstrates that invaluable quality. He notes that we’re growing up in
times where visual stimuli can border exploitation. However, imagery of
space exploration is unconditionally breath-taking and sexy. He states,
“the reason that we go to Mars, the Moon, or Europa is for the idea of
exploration”. While making another place our “home” is far from the
tangible reality, we should be placing effort towards more physically
substantial&amp;nbsp;programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is Sachs’ perspective demonstrated through this recent exhibit,
but so much more of his voice has been documented through the various
projects he’s had his hands in. Bridging underground cult-phenomenons
with lo-tech production processes, Sachs asserts that there is a
precious parameter in simplicity. He stresses that we live in a world of
conveniences, which allow us “an ask away from knowing anything”, while
polluting our environments with technology too opaque to understand and
use. To navigate these specialized sectors in human development, we need
to question how to use the machine to help our hearts. We’ve found so
many useful reasons to incorporate technology into our lives at a
personal level, and it’s opened the world up a little, we need to answer
the “so-what” behind our&amp;nbsp;modernization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 2009 and 2012, Sachs set out to testify the tenants of reuse,
repair, and durability over those attached to mass production. As a
culture, we have come to accept products that live a short lifetime.
Inherent to the materials they are produced out of, the things that we
use should become better with time, such as leather and plywood. While
mass-production affords us a “useful strategy” and offers the chance of
some recyclability, we should be looking to objects to have “long-term
strength”. Working in conjunction with Nike, Sachs developed the “Mars
Yard Shoe”. Sachs approached the project from an angle beyond
expectation : he conceived the athletic end-user as a mechanical
engineer. This shoe disrupts the market through the story it yields.
Many more designed objects can be found &lt;a href="http://nikecraft.com/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, as Sachs designed a
series of things to serve this purpose. Through his intention of repair,
reuse, and strength, these objects personify the future that Sachs
believes we could&amp;nbsp;seek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By building suspense, destroying our expectations, and valuing women
through technology, Sachs is identifying the audience as the voyeur. In
his work, the “worm” font from early &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; years pops up continuously,
providing a visceral and nostalgic emotion to a captive audience. We
watch, we wait, we listen, and digest. In understanding that there is a
pluralism in the greatness of all things, Sachs’ work serves to call
attention to our disposable environments. Not only does his work
capitalize on construction material, but it also proves that the
internet is the vehicle for distribution and consumption. We are able to
multi-task in a flash, sourcing images which is part of a “bigger field
to connect our minds” on a “telepathic”&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is space through the eyes of a conscious, heart-driven, and
talented arteur. His work not only manifests the breadth of various
generations, but it also highlights the importance of valuable
resources, the sex-appeal of space, and the significance of a sci-fi
writer’s&amp;nbsp;dream.&lt;/p&gt;

the experience of a behind-the-scenes tour of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to high school aged
kids around the country. The unique event will take place on August 3rd
at 12 noon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDT&lt;/span&gt; and promises to be a great resource for interested high
school students to spark their interest in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and creating space

The &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hacd/laboratories/neurosciences.html"&gt;Neurosciences Lab&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Johnson Space Center offers a rare
glimpse of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; makers in action and focuses on a major interest area
for makers globally: human stimulus and response. This aim is also a
major interest area for human spaceflight, since mitigating the effects
of microgravity is a field that is continuously making
mini-breakthroughs which have a strong link to technologies we use on
Earth (for motion sickness, pilot response, etc.). The Neurosciences
facility consists of several “enclosures&amp;#8221; within which test subjects are
subjected to a multitude of tests that measure their response to various
stimuli. While the hardware is designed for space research, the maker
community will be surprised to learn that this cutting edge research
utilizes inexpensive and common objects found outside of the lab - some
of which is reminiscent of the devices described in Make: Volume 29,
&amp;#8220;Hack Your&amp;nbsp;Bod&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the field trip participants will interact with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; maker and
Neuroscientist Matthew Fiedler who will explain how he makes, adapts and
uses the technologies in the lab daily. Astronaut Ron Garan, who has
been a subject for several studies, will also be co-hosting in person
and sharing his perspective. You&amp;#8217;ll also virtually meet the Principal
Investigator of many of the devices, Dr. Scott Wood. In order to
showcase the connection between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Earth and to encourage campers to
build their own solutions to complex problems, amateur makers who have
made similar technologies will be given an opportunity to share and

Controller&lt;/a&gt; for the&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. The easiest way to
explain my job is that in space, we have to reproduce everything that
the Earth does for us; recycle water for the crew to drink, produce
oxygen for them to breathe, remove carbon dioxide from the air. My team
manages that system from the ground so the crew can focus on operating
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; as a science&amp;nbsp;facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When and why did you join &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWB&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWB&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; in December of 2008 because I wanted to be able to
apply my knowledge and experience to problems in the developing&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWB&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m a project lead for our &lt;a href="http://www.ewb-jsc.org/projects/rwanda.html"&gt;Rwanda Project&lt;/a&gt;, where we&amp;#8217;re developing a
sustainable fruit drying system for &lt;a href="http://lesperancerwanda.org/"&gt;L’ Esperance Children’s Village&lt;/a&gt;
in Rwanda, so they can sell the fruit abroad. The hope is that the
orphanage will be able to create their own income source, and remove
themselves from the seemingly endless cycle of donations eventually that
run out. It’s all about a sustainable income model; if they can start a
business where the profits pay for the children&amp;#8217;s healthcare and food,
the operations of the orphanage and then send the children to school and
then provide scholarships for university, so they can establish a new
model of sustainable&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Describe the connection between rural developing communities and space&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very often developing communities exist on the margins of resource
availability. Lack of access to clean water is a huge problem in the
developing world, as is are meeting basic sanitation needs. The
community in Rwanda where the orphanage is doesn&amp;#8217;t have access to an
electrical grid. In many ways, issues within the developing world
parallel those in space; scarce or very strained resources for
sustaining life. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a strong history of developing technology to
sustain life in space. Much of that technology is applicable here on
Earth to sustainably improve life in the developing&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does what you do for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; relate to what you do for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWB&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maintaining life in space is probably one of the most difficult things
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; does. Much of it has to do with using resources as efficiently as
possible. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EWB&lt;/span&gt; applies the same logic to work here on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name 5 uses for Duct&amp;nbsp;Tape.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once used it to fix a pipe in my bathroom while living in China. You
really can do just about anything with&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do I have to I have to be a rocket scientist to join Engineers Without&amp;nbsp;Borders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a long list of people who made a difference before we even had
rockets, so the answer is pretty solidly&amp;nbsp;no.&lt;/p&gt;

On behalf of the Fragile
Oasis team, I invite you to roll up your sleeves and &lt;strong&gt;Do 1 Thing to
make life better on this planet we call&amp;nbsp;home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;July 20th is a special day in the history of humankind. We celebrate the
day 43 years ago when two of the Apollo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;XI&lt;/span&gt; astronauts landed on Earth’s
moon, and left their footprints on its surface. It is also the day we
mark the &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/blog/2011/7/thats-one-small-step-for-man/"&gt;second anniversary of fragileoasis.org&lt;/a&gt;, the catalyst for a
growing community of people from all walks of life who look for
opportunities to better our communities and our world, making life
better for all of&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that spirit, let us know what you are doing - the down-to-earth kinds
of things people do everyday - bagging trash from a park, reading to
children at a public library, helping a neighbor - any individual act
when multiplied by others builds the momentum that changes the world bit

her blog &lt;a href="http://bethbeck.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/stay-tuned-for-launch-beyond-waste/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We hope you&amp;#8217;ll join us this week and follow along
with the&amp;nbsp;event!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s finally here — &lt;a href="http://bethbeck.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/launch-culture-of-collaboration/" title="LAUNCH: Culture of Collaboration"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Beyond Waste&lt;/a&gt;! We’ve been working for the
last six months to get to this point. We head out to Pasadena,
California this week to hear from nine innovators with creative ways to
create value from discarded products  – plastic bottles, human and plant
waste, unused fabric, and&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;for those of you who haven’t heard me talk about it before&lt;/em&gt;, is
a social entrepreneurship enterprise that breaks new ground in
public/private partnerships. We created the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; program three years
ago to address large, sustainability-related challenges that no single
government or commercial entity can solve alone. Our talented &lt;a href="http://launch.org/team_page/" title="LAUNCH team"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
team&lt;/a&gt; searches for transformative innovations, which we connect with a
collaborative group of thought leaders and experts which we call &lt;a href="http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste/council" title="LAUNCH Council"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
Council&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; Innovators are uniquely poised to accelerate their
innovations for greater impact and scale by leveraging the advice,
networks, and resources of the &lt;a href="http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste/council" title="LAUNCH Council"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; Council&lt;/a&gt; members and the global
stage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ultimate goal of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; is a sustainable future for planet Earth
and her&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste" title="LAUNCH: Beyond Waste"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Beyond Wast&lt;/a&gt;e forum is the fourth in a series of
challenges, following Water, Health, and Energy. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; team focused
on waste as a challenge topic in order to address increasing strain on
the planet’s limited resources. Global citizens, as well as explorers
who leave Earth’s protection, share the need for creative solutions to
the issue of waste — from designing for zero waste to revaluing existing
waste from inefficient production and processes. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Beyond Waste
addresses this global&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the tagline from &lt;a href="http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste/innovators/42/goonj/profile" title="LAUNCH innovator Goonj"&gt;Anshu Gupta of Goonj&lt;/a&gt;, one of our innovators
from India, who wants to transform the cash society into a trash society
— meaning trash = revenue stream. Our western version: one man’s trash
is another man’s&amp;nbsp;treasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the cool movie posters our team (Trish and Lilly) created to

logic. By looking for answers to that hammering sense of frustration we
face in our daily interactions, the age of robots is on deck. Though we
haven’t completely ascribed ourselves to this new genome, we already
look to objects to use logic to work seamlessly in our everyday lives.
For the limitations of human ability, robots provide conveniences to
difficult tasks. However, I think we all wonder if this technology will
prove to be a more evolved species than we ourselves&amp;nbsp;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, let’s dive into the humorous and playful side of robotics.
Developed at the  &lt;a href="http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/"&gt;Ishikawa Oku Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; at the University of Tokyo
in Japan, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3nxjjztQKtY&amp;amp;feature=player_embedded"&gt;this robot&lt;/a&gt; is capable of deciphering visual cues and make
decisions based on the input. The robot is able to make it’s own
decisions independent of human leadership, which could mean so much for
the future emotional relationship between humans and machines. By
focusing on social and psychological interactions in the real world,
Ishikawa Oku designs systems that enhance our experiences through : (1)
sensory fusion, (2) dynamic image control, (3) parallel image processing
through vision chips, and (4) meta perception. By exploring this branch
of technology, machines will become further extensions of our internal
and external&amp;nbsp;lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our work environments, robots carry out complicated and hazardous
routines without fail, which is an impossible feat. Surgeons have
recently found great advantages relying on the dynamism and precision of
robot &lt;a href="http://www.intuitivesurgical.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;da Vinci&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By placing a value on doctor dexerity and
gracefulness, robotics is a science which mimics natural, human skill.
Making up three parts of the whole, &lt;em&gt;da Vinci&lt;/em&gt; works through a surgeons
console, a robotic cart, and a high-definition 3D vision&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so much promise, robots take to hallowed testing ground aboard the
International Space Station. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Astronauts work with &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/r2_first_work.html"&gt;Robonauts&lt;/a&gt; in
outer space to complete rudimentary tasks, measuring the positives and
negatives of humanoid technology. The environment and lab aboard the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;
is a unique and invaluable pool for experimenting with possibilities.
Not only can robots iterate usefulness among scientists on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; with
precision and logic, but more importantly, they can demonstrate
potential useful applications on&amp;nbsp;earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The argument for robots can be made with statistical evidence from
examples as these, but cost of the technology continues to be a huge
issue. Through open hardware, &lt;a href="http://www.lego.com/en-us/CreateAndShare/Galleries/default.aspx?icmp=COUSCreateShareSL100Galleries"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEGO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; approaches the issue from a
different perspective. Placing an importance on future robot-breeders,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEGO&lt;/span&gt; has begun to embed programmable elements into their inexpensive
building blocks. By teaching children unconventionally in their playful
environments, businesses have the ability to communicate valuable
lessons such as : repairable circuits and systems with modular pieces,
interchangeable parts, conceptual thinking, programming, and teamwork.
Therefore, the accessibility of knowledge for building, fusing, and
programming is in just about any toy store. &lt;a href="http://mindstorms.lego.com/en-us/Default.aspx"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEGO&lt;/span&gt;’s Mindstorm&lt;/a&gt; chip
allows children to build robots using color, touch, and sensory input.
Not only do ideas like these propagate making, but they also encourage
the notion of “modding” (or modifying) methods. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Engineer Dr. Chris
Rogers uses robotics to encourage the link between engineering,
education, creativity, problem solving, and control theory. Watch his
GoogleTechTalk on his experiences using open technology, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EG-izyXfFHI"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over at &lt;a href="http://www.willowgarage.com/"&gt;Willow Garage&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR2&lt;/span&gt; (personal robot) is coming to effect
in our everyday lives. By looking at the actual interactions we face
with technology, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR2&lt;/span&gt; is the next iteration of a physical intelligent
object. Using a goal as a means, Willow Garage looks to the collective
partnership of aspiring designers, engineers, machinists, and theorists
for robotics research. The company’s operating system is open to public
domain to prove, use, share, and hack. In our own lives, we saw a
significant shift in the value of personal computers. Willow Garage has
a belief that we will experience the same result with our robotic
companions. Like a nerve center, the robots functions, thoughts, and
actions will be able to be manipulated. As you envision a need, you
design and alter the system which executes your instructions. This type
of thinking will not only teach users making skills, it will also
propagate conscious consumption. The landscape will provide new
environments, reaching a point where it is unremarkable to come in
contact with a&amp;nbsp;robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information age novelist William Gibson once eloquently stated, “the
future is already here - it’s just not evenly distributed”. However, the
dawn of the robots is on us, as we will continue to develop complex
interactions through open and accessible technology. And in this era, it
is not so much the theory that will deepen our understanding, but it is
the practice and implementation that will stir and create change. The
age of oncoming exploration will exist through the citizen innovators
and everyday collaborators, as tools become more available and problems
saturate our lives. With open as our mission, this stuff isn’t only
extremely cool, it’s also part of our&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Above is a little more about Willow Garage’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR2&lt;/span&gt; robotics platform.
Started by former Google employee Scott Hassan, Willow Garage believes
in the future of personal robots in an open hardware and open software&amp;nbsp;framework.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Bring Curiosity to your living room with Spacecraft 3D</title><link href="/bring-curiosity-to-your-living-room-with-spacecraft-3d" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-12T16:02:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sean Herron</name></author><id>tag:,2012-07-12:bring-curiosity-to-your-living-room-with-spacecraft-3d</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; released &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spacecraft-3d/id541089908?mt=8" title="Spacecraft 3D - iTunes"&gt;Spacecraft 3D&lt;/a&gt;, an augmented reality
application for the iPhone and iPad that allows you to create a 3D
version of either Curiosity, the Mars rover current en-route to the Red
Planet, or the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRAIL&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft, currently orbiting the moon. Although
it may sound simple, the technology behind making the models appear on
your device is actually fairly advanced. It works like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You print out a special &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; (the app will email it to you) that has
    a particular pattern printed on it. This pattern allows your device
    to align and orient itself and figure out how to position the&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once your device has a lock on the pattern, sensors inside (such as
    the accelerometer) along with tracking of the pattern allow your
    device to move the model in relation to how your device moves,
    enabling you to pan around and zoom in on the&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun playing around with the app at my desk today. Here&amp;#8217;s
a picture of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRAIL&lt;/span&gt; hanging off the side of my&amp;nbsp;wall:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="GRAIL Spacecraft on the wall of my office" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/grailonwall.jpg" title="GRAIL on Wall" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also make the models move and interact - for example, Curiosity
will rotate around and extend its robotic&amp;nbsp;arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacecraft 3D is a great demonstration of augmented reality technology
and some of the potentials it has for work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and in the world.
Imagine using similar technology to project images on the helmets of
astronauts on spacewalks to help them locate and move components. With
the increases in computing power that we are seeing today, augmented
reality will quickly become feasible for the masses and technologies
like Google&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111626127367496192147/posts" title="Google Project Glass"&gt;Project Glass&lt;/a&gt; will become ubiquitous. Think of the&amp;nbsp;possibilities!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spacecraft 3D is currently available for iPhone and iPad and will be
coming to other platforms&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways
that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for
humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. —Sylvia&amp;nbsp;Earle&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 16 &lt;a href="http://oneworldoneocean.org"&gt;One World One Ocean&lt;/a&gt; will join &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/sylviaearle"&gt;Dr. Sylvia Earle&lt;/a&gt;,
National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, Liquid Pictures 3D, and a
team of aquanauts for a 6-day expedition to a &amp;#8220;research only&amp;#8221; zone in
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, home to &lt;a href="http://aquarius.uncw.edu/"&gt;Aquarius&lt;/a&gt;, the last
remaining underwater lab in the world. Since 1993, America&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;inner
space station&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; has helped us understand the disappearance of coral
reefs, train &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; astronauts for space and research sea sponges, the
source of two cancer drugs. The discoveries made at Aquarius have opened
our eyes to how little we really know about the vast complexity of the
ocean. It is one of the planet&amp;#8217;s most important brain trusts, and it is
about to be&amp;nbsp;closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may be the final mission to Aquarius Reef Base! One World One Ocean

We
share it here to encourage us to think about the stories we have to tell
- and how important it is that we commit to telling&amp;nbsp;them. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last night, as I drove down &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Parkway, I glanced towards the dimly
lit buildings littered across the Johnson Space Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;) property. A
part of an actual Saturn V lay ahead, just past the silhouetted trees of
the Memorial Garden, where the heroes and legends of human spaceflight
past are honored for their contributions and sacrifices. My eyes
traveled a bit further to the right, where a gleaming American flag
stood proud and tall, atop a building that holds tremendous significance
for those of us who’ve had even a minute aspiration to contribute to
space exploration – the Mission Control&amp;nbsp;Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; is an interesting amalgamation of new and old, a distinct dichotomy
of past and present; where many buildings stand, having weathered
decades of political, societal, even meteorological storms. Time and
technology’s marks have been left on their interiors, which have endured
series of renovations and&amp;nbsp;upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, strolling through the relatively empty parking lot of Mission
Control, I thought a lot about the role and duty we have as space
enthusiasts to reach out and engage the general public, who’re unaware
of the vast benefits and implications of the human spaceflight&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few days, I had a bit of an enlightening&amp;nbsp;moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 1st of this year, the President announced his new plan for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Add whatever superlative you’d like to describe the plan, but one
thing one cannot deny is that it is, in fact, quite dissimilar from what
we are used to. I mean, he’s talking about landing on an
asteroid…Armageddon-style (clearly not how we’d do it, but I say that
simply to emphasize a point: that’s what the public will think of as
soon as this plan is officially&amp;nbsp;adopted).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transition is soon to be upon us, and as I pondered this, I came to
the following realization: what better way to approach and work through
a transition than actively work to communicate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and human
spaceflight’s value to those around us, in whatever small way we&amp;nbsp;can?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about this before the thought is&amp;nbsp;discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the societal impact that human spaceflight has made over the
years. In its peak of popularity amongst the general public, those very
same people – the taxpayers – knew &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was doing. After
all, we had a singular goal: beat the Russians to the moon. Easy to
stand behind a single goal,&amp;nbsp;right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understandably, as technology has developed, so, too, have the agency’s
goals…to the point where the average Joe Schmo no longer has a clear
idea of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is trying to accomplish, or even what the agency is
working on across its ten&amp;nbsp;centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what does this mean? The unique thing, in my eyes, about the
spaceflight community is the number of advocates it has, in and out of
the ranks of the agency and its contracting community. There are space
enthusiasts of varying levels not just across the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;, but across the
world. Space exploration has a magical influence on those who crave
adventure that overpowers every sense and engulfs the mind. It’s that
inexplicable feeling of overwhelming excitement and fascination that
I’ve yet been able to articulate into words, and not for a lack of
trying, I might&amp;nbsp;add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my last post, I challenged the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetup
participants. I mentioned that we have a collective responsibility to
engage those around us and communicate the excitement we felt at the
time of our space “firsts.” And after thinking about this over the last
few days, I realized that it’s not just those affiliated with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; who
have this obligation. It’s a responsibility we must all share as space
enthusiasts, regardless of whether we’ve set foot inside any one of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s&amp;nbsp;centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just think about the implications of turning to your friend, who doesn’t
even know that Atlantis and her crew were hard at work these last couple
of weeks, who may not even know that we had &lt;em&gt;twelve&lt;/em&gt; people living and
breathing &lt;em&gt;off&lt;/em&gt; the planet, who may not even know that we have had
continuous human presence in space for &lt;em&gt;so many years&lt;/em&gt;, and telling
him/her about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; of those things and more. What if we worked
collectively and actively over the next several months to excite those
around us with those facts and our own personal stories? What if,
through this transition, more and more people learned about all the
interesting and exciting things that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has done in the past,
continues to do, and most importantly, all of the great number of
achievements left before us? After all…hello, 21st &lt;strong&gt;century&lt;/strong&gt;,
adventure is calling, and we really need to answer. Asteroids? Sure!
Mars? You betcha! The possibilities are truly limitless. And I should
insert a note here to deter naysayers from commenting on the current
future of our space program: I purposely bolded century, as we have a
long ways to go until the end…the century does not end after the next
election cycle, nor after 2020 when we were supposed to have a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; human
presence on the moon, and definitely not after 2030 when humans were to
live on&amp;nbsp;Mars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My naïve, little mind tells me that this could perhaps be the silver
lining to the grey cloud of transition. I don’t see the lack of our
national capability to send people into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEO&lt;/span&gt; as a negative thing anymore.
Sure, it stinks a little bit…but as we work to build the next generation
of vehicles, there’s no reason we can’t help to inspire the next
generation of&amp;nbsp;explorers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work large, work small…it doesn’t matter how many people you reach out
to, but think about the implication of just this small&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stories are powerful…and personal stories, they convey the emotions and
subtleties that a simple third-hand recounting just cannot. Think back
to the first time you saw Mission Control, or the first time you met an
astronaut, the first time you saw the Space Shuttle roar to the sky, or
even the first time an astronaut wrote to you on Twitter. Think about
the excitement that you felt and the awe that it inspired. Think about
getting to share that feeling, about getting to share in that passion
with someone else. There’s no reason we can’t all, in our own way, tell
people about the amazing experiences we’ve had, whether it’s working at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; or just&amp;nbsp;visiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve realized over the course of the last two weeks the true impact of
communicating our story to those around me. Engaging, even after the
event, with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetup participants has demonstrated to me, in a
profoundly significant way, the true greatness of the opportunity I
have. Not until yesterday did I realize the unique vantage point I’m
privy to…the ability (and now the willingness) to tell all of the people
I get to meet through these opportunities about the amazing things &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I extend my challenge – not to just you, but myself, as well. You
all share that unique perspective, in one form or another, as space&amp;nbsp;enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How will you capitalize on&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>One Year on the Job</title><link href="/one-year-on-the-job" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-07-09T13:54:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Garret Fitzpatrick</name></author><id>tag:,2012-07-09:one-year-on-the-job</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post by &lt;a href="http://garretfitzpatrick.com/contact/"&gt;Garret Fitzpatrick&lt;/a&gt; was originally written in October
2008. We share it here to remind us to step back and remember why we are
here - and what&amp;#8217;s worth staying here&amp;nbsp;for. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whew-I made&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One full year on the&amp;nbsp;job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m writing you this blog entry as a combined present for our
anniversary and your 50^th^ birthday. Even though I&amp;#8217;m technically late
on both and you might have been hoping for a more substantial present
like a bouquet of tulips or a nice dinner at that fancy French
restaurant in town or a pearl necklace-yeah right on my salary!-I hope
you won&amp;#8217;t use that in future arguments over which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TV&lt;/span&gt; show we&amp;#8217;ll watch on
Tuesday nights. I&amp;#8217;m still voting for &lt;em&gt;House&lt;/em&gt;, for the&amp;nbsp;record).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started full-time at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; back in August 2007, having graduated the
previous May after spending five co-op tours at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; over the previous
four years. They say you usually don&amp;#8217;t start talking to yourself or
addressing the agency as your significant other for at least 10 years,
so I&amp;#8217;m thrilled to be ahead of the curve on this&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year might not sound like all that significant to most, but to me,
it&amp;#8217;s a huge milestone. An-all-too-welcoming stroll down memory lane
brings me back the image of a college junior, tying a tie eight times
before getting it right the morning of his first day as a co-op, then
staring wide-eyed at the monster Saturn V rocket lying on its side in
the grass at the main gate of the center, an ominous sentry to the
unsuspecting kid who still couldn&amp;#8217;t believe he had landed an interview
with the agency, let alone to be actually sitting in his car outside its&amp;nbsp;gates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But apparently I tied that tie well enough to get hired on as a
full-timer, joining the ranks of men and women whose ingenuity had
inspired me to crack open the differential equations textbooks (ugh) and
survive the all-night college library exam studying (read: cramming) to
get to where I am now, celebrating a year of ups and downs, triumphs and
failures, exploring questions and trying to make the agency a little
better place than when I got&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wednesday I drove through the gates at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; and I thought of that first
day on the job. I glanced at the (relatively) recently-built giant
building enclosing the massive Saturn V; the beast of a rocket built to
billow colossal plumes of fire and smoke and taught to reach constantly
upward into the heavens as the height of our audaciousness, fueled by a
defiant dream and the lure of the unknown, now asked to bathe in shadow,
awaiting a lifetime of staring at a wall of corrugated aluminum siding
while tourists gawk at the grandeur of man&amp;#8217;s creations and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
employees drive past, largely oblivious to its tormented suffering in
their rush to meet the next impossible&amp;nbsp;schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A rocket that took astronauts to the moon all those years&amp;nbsp;ago&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if I had just finished up my first year in 1968, instead of 2008?
Would I have this same excitement? Would I be so driven? Or, more
importantly, would I be talking to myself like&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what it was like to drive through that same gate on the way to
a day on the job, working towards a goal of lifting humans to heights
never before reached, to our knowledge, in the history of the universe.
To live in a world where man had not yet walked on the surface of
another heavenly body. What was that world like when those
preconceptions of man&amp;#8217;s limitations were&amp;nbsp;shattered?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t imagine such a world because the people who drove past that gate
and many others like it for so long have given me the gift of seeing the
world through different&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In our rush to figure out how to improve the openness of the agency
and either anoint or discredit the past, current, or future generations
of engineers and rocket scientists, leaders and dreamers, heroes and
soldiers of exploration, let&amp;#8217;s not forget to take a step back and smile
at that&amp;nbsp;gift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

visit to a hidden basement at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Johnson Space&amp;nbsp;Center.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buried three floors underground in a restricted area is a 50 year old
room encapsulated by 20cm thick lead walls, which is so cut off from the
world that even the air does not mix with the environment.  This is a
place of legend and intrigue, acting as a perfect stage for what would
be an Alfred Hitchock movie. Containing untouched evidence, this space
was part of an era enthralled with going “where no man has gone
before”.  Committing ourselves to exploring the intersection of design,
technology and society, we decided to take a tour of this remote and
often overlooked historical landmark with our teammate and resident
maker, Chris&amp;nbsp;Gerty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Location&lt;/strong&gt;: the basement of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Johnson Space Center’s Building 37,
the former Lunar Receiving Laboratory, a building originally constructed
to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarantine"&gt;quarantine&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronauts"&gt;astronauts&lt;/a&gt; and material brought back from

returning from the moon did not contaminate society with much feared
space cooties, crews recovered from the sea walked from
their &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicopter"&gt;helicopter&lt;/a&gt; to an isolation van on the deck of an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft_carrier"&gt;aircraft
carrier&lt;/a&gt; and were brought to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LRL&lt;/span&gt; for quarantine. Samples of rock
and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regolith"&gt;regolith&lt;/a&gt; that the astronauts collected and brought back were
flown directly to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LRL&lt;/span&gt; and initially analyzed 50 ft below the
building in glovebox &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_chamber"&gt;vacuum chambers&lt;/a&gt; in a Lab called the Radiation
Counting Laboratory. This facility was important for measuring the
natural radioactivity of the lunar samples, some of which is caused by
cosmic rays.  Half a century later, the room sits relatively unused and&amp;nbsp;forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our mission:&lt;/strong&gt; to uncover unused hardware stored in this neglected
locale with hopes of inviting the hacker community to unravel
application to today. This subterranean area is a space which holds some
of the clues and links to our technological history. In that history, we
are seeking the untold stories of the past. Today, we have a handbag of
tools which allow us to create to our minds’ desire. But between these
objects of antiquity and the modern age, there is a lapse in things
unseen. By exploring these spaces and observing how &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; way the past was
assembled, we can create a better future with the logical intelligence
of the space age and the modern resources of&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we did discover some pretty cool instruments, what was more
impressive was the experience. Crossing through the gate into the
dedicated elevator heightened the sense of respect for the content that
the space contained.  Our ears popped as we descended to the lowest
point on the Johnson Space Center’s grounds, envisioning the uncertainty
and excitement harbored by the few employees who had the chance to view
this portal.  We playfully took photos next to abandoned lead boxes and
bricks in our converse &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; jeans, as our escort described the suits that
encapsulated the staff that had spent long hours cataloging and
analyzing materials that literally were out-of-this world.  The drab
colors, fluorescent lighting, heavy materials, and unfamiliar layout of
the room reinforced the facilities’ purpose &amp;#8212; to contain and understand
the unknown. We developed a new admiration for these cold war pioneers
who overcame fear and took unprecedented risks each mission and every
day spent researching underground.  The science and insight gained from
the Apollo program would yield numerous spinoffs, position the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; a
leader in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;, and inspire so many, including young women like
ourselves, to reach for the&amp;nbsp;stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What other physical discoveries throughout history have been treated
with such deliberate design and scientific care: titanic artifacts, cave
drawings, Mars meteorites?  We invite you to comment and share your
thoughts as we explore the past and the future&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;

series of interactions and thoughts. We surround ourselves with them. No
matter where you are, who you’re with, or what you’re doing, something
inanimate is part of your experience. These objects are so integral in
our daily experiences through the age of manufacturing. Procured during
a time when money was seldom and when design was booming, this luxury
overhauled the way we functioned, worked, and lived. But in the modern
era, the implications of manufacturing provide a new set of challenges
and restrictions for the future. We are fighting the very thing we
created in order to advance. Rather than using the same methods of the
past, how can we use the same type of thinking that bred a solution in
the industrial era, for today’s world? That magic technology of the
early 20th century exists in a pocket&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Jon Rogers, operator of MSc &lt;a href="http://productdesign.dundee.ac.uk/"&gt;Product Design at the
University of Dundee&lt;/a&gt;, who shed a little bit of light on how his
passion for design has evolved over the course of his life and how he
continues to be inspired by the “possibilities” of what can be done.
Focused on the in-between of physical and digital, Rogers has paid very
close attention to the post-industrial world through his adventurous
work for the past ten years, before the web had even phased society. Our
conversation reminded me that &lt;strong&gt;true change comes from picking up a
device you don’t know, and teaching yourself how to make something out
of it.&lt;/strong&gt; Rogers is just one of many out there, who tangles personal
passions into everyday&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive, active, and engaging technology is bringing around concepts
that exist in the nook and crannies of imagination. Because of the
widely accessible, free tools we can use at any time on the web, the
generation of possibilities is exploding. Understanding milestones in
this regard, the &lt;a href="https://vimeo.com/19930744"&gt;1992 Durrell Bishop Marble Answer Machine&lt;/a&gt;, was one
of the foundry interaction projects that brought life to the intangible.
From that time, we’ve seen &lt;a href="http://www.luckybite.com/luckybits/index.html"&gt;progressive technology that thinks in this
way&lt;/a&gt;, but makes use of resources available to our everyday. And at the
same time, while we have companies creating hardware that can be
“hacked” (or used for good), we also have software services that are
creating a &lt;a href="http://www.creativetimes.co.uk/articles/let-s-get-physical-with-digital"&gt;landscape socially&lt;/a&gt;. This is where inspiration and funny
thoughts create meaningful experiences, beyond just the technology
producing it. &lt;a href="http://www.uniform.net/thinking-archive/sweet-tweets/"&gt;Sweet Tweet&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most exciting projects
socially and digitally. Produced by &lt;a href="http://www.uniform.net/author/scott/"&gt;Uniform&lt;/a&gt; and Rogers, this design
distributes a prize every time you’re mentioned in a tweet. Just through
our conversation, Rogers introduced so many active and past projects
that propagate constant questioning and learning through data and
technology of the&amp;nbsp;age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One general question that I think is asked many times, is “&lt;em&gt;what is the
actual, quantifiable value of design in society?&lt;/em&gt;” To answer a piece of
that question, &lt;a href="http://ideo.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDEO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; produced a document detailing evidence of
design’s value, in a downloadable version &lt;a href="http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Not only is the
human-centered design theory evident in research, but it also exists in
practice. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s widely-successful &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/home/"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, posed an extensive list of problem statements to the
general community, hoping for tangible solutions and concepts. What
started as an idea, grew into one of the largest &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/06/29/the-power-of-hackathons-in-government/"&gt;hackathon&lt;/a&gt; events in
history, boasting 17 countries, 25 cities, 108 organizations, 2083
citizens, 71 challenges, 101 solutions, 3.3 million media impressions,
and all in just 48 hours. What these numbers don’t count, is the amount
of impact these solutions will have on the future. With one of the most
spectacular and disruptive projects resulting from the challenge, Rogers
created a &lt;a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Pollen-Predictor-International-Space-Apps-Challenge/3821111"&gt;3D printed Pollen Predictor&lt;/a&gt;, which exists to represent
data in a physical&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With an Arduino, paper, and cardboard, Rogers suggests that you can
create anything. Rogers asks, “Can you make it for a dollar?” Questions
like these benefit business models of the future. So go out, buy one
today, “fold some paper around it” and make it fantastic. You may not
know how to connect your device to the web, but that’s okay. Communicate
to the world that making is part of our future, by using the web
effectively by documenting that process&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the successes of the past to prove that the way in which we make
things can procure and embed the future. Line assembly was one of the
most outstanding advances in technology, just as other production
processes continue to be in our everyday. Technology as a catalyst
presented the world with intelligent objects. By mimicking our thoughts,
actions, and habits, design is calibrating mankind towards a world of
unfounded creation. With a blank piece of paper before you and
absolutely no idea how to begin, think about this : don’t just take
after the masses that ride the coat-tails of technology, rather
challenge technology. What manufacturing did for design in the 1930’s,
are what digital tools could do for us right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rogers states, “&lt;strong&gt;the role of you as a maker is to demonstrate the
future, not to conserve the past.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

supported the use of hackathons in developing government innovation. He
&lt;a href="http://gov20radio.com/2012/04/countdown-spaceapps/"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that these events were exceptional as a ‘sensemaking’ tool for
government, encouraging agencies to &amp;#8220;…find groups of people, bring them
together around an issue or problem that needs to be fixed, then step
out of the way and let the collective energy of the people in the room
come together and really take that data and solve things in creative and
imaginative ways that we would never have done&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what does that mean for us at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are constantly on the lookout for &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/game_changing_technology/index.html"&gt;game-changing ideas and
technologies&lt;/a&gt; – and hackathons can often be the source of exactly
those kinds of new ideas. We’re committed to [&lt;em&gt;provide for the widest
practicable and appropriate dissemination of information concerning our
activities and the results thereof&lt;/em&gt;][] – and hackathons frequently show
us insights and applications that we never would have imagined coming
from our own work. These technology development events don’t give us all
the answers – but they engage the public in exploration of our data and
our challenges in creative and compelling ways, sparking a flame that
just might become something big and powerful. A hackathon isn’t a
product, it’s an &lt;em&gt;approach&lt;/em&gt; – and the key to using this “tool in the
toolkit” successfully is to invest the effort to identify the right
problem statements, provide the supporting data, and get a good mix of
people in the&amp;nbsp;room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tim O’Reilly noted, government, at its core, is about &lt;strong&gt;doing
together what we can’t do alone&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s why we believe that &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/26/citizen-engagement/"&gt;citizen
engagement is vital for space exploration&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the key to answer
‘why a&amp;nbsp;hackathon.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; offers a singular perspective on and understanding of our universe
and our Earth’s place in it. With an enormous amount of remote sensing
data, Earth observation imagery, and technological expertise, hackathons
provides a platform and resources to help equip volunteers to address
those global problems, creating a forum for &lt;strong&gt;mass collaboration around
open data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team is frequently asked about how our efforts related to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
other challenge offerings like the &lt;a href="https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/NASA"&gt;Innovation Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/centennial_challenges/index.html"&gt;Centennial
Challenges&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="http://community.topcoder.com/ntl/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tournament Lab&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these programs offers
unique and specialized opportunities for public engagement in technology
development and represents a vital element in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open innovation
portfolio. Many of them operate under the federal Prizes and Challenges
authority/America &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COMPETES&lt;/span&gt; Act, [“accelerating problem-solving by
tapping America’s top talent and best expertise wherever it may lie.”][]
At the same time, they are very different platforms serving a unique
role in government innovation - hackathons are non-monetized mass
collaborations that differ widely from those monetized prize
competitions (see the &lt;a href="http://challenge.gov/"&gt;challenge.gov&lt;/a&gt; platform) that have been the
trend in government over the past few&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;’s Chief Digital Officer Rachel Sterne noted that mass collaborations
bridge sectors and connect the government and technology communities
with a shared challenge, encouraging collaborative problem solving and a
more open government. Monetized competitions often aren’t able to access
these same benefits. Hackathons are incredibly effective at building
community; making and creating together forges deep and powerful
connections across people, communities, and&amp;nbsp;organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackathons also feature an open design process, equipping developers
directly with the data that they need and clearly demonstrating what the
public wants and needs. The commitment to open, agile development and
open source licensing – as opposed to a more compartmentalized
procurement process – produces a product better connected to the
agency’s original need as well as to the public’s interest and&amp;nbsp;expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of a hackathon provides a fundamentally different product
because it engages a full community of citizens who purposely
collaborate in the real work of their government – in this case, the
work of “reaching for new heights and revealing the unknown.” Hackathons
create a mechanism for the public to share feedback and ideas via access
to government decision makers. Creative and innovative concepts are
introduced that help evolve government to be more efficient and
effective. “Politics is not changing; government is changing, and
because government ultimately derives its power from us (remember we the
people) &lt;em&gt;how we think about it is going to affect how that change
happens&lt;/em&gt;.” explained Code for America&amp;#8217;s Jennifer&amp;nbsp;Pahlka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; really do
represent how a new generation is tackling the challenges of government:
&lt;strong&gt;with collective action&lt;/strong&gt;. The future of government requires engaged
citizens who are contributing their skills and talents to the core
mission of exploring the unknown and pioneering the future. The key to
improving life on Earth – and enabling us to explore further into the
universe – is to roll up our sleeves, do it together, and then let it go
viral, &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/03/14/coding-for-better-government/"&gt;just like Jennifer describes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; needs technology to tackle
the grand challenges it faces – but it also needs policy specialists,
engineers, storytellers, educators, and diverse&amp;nbsp;perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jake Levitas &lt;a href="http://www.gaffta.org/2012/06/19/three-incredible-things-about-civic-hackathons/"&gt;concludes&lt;/a&gt;: “Hackathons are incredibly effective at
creating accountability. Part of the power of prototypes and
community-building are that they drive conversation around what is
possible. If a picture is worth a thousand words, a working demo and a
team to stand behind it are worth a hundred thousand. The Government 2.0
movement has not just offered promise about how technology can reshape
government, it has completely and rapidly reformed the very notion of
government and citizen engagement, offering a fully novel suite of
previously unimaginable civic tools for government and citizens alike…
There are certainly limitations to the value that can be produced in 48
hours, no matter how numerous or how talented the people are in the
room. But the fact that this conversation is even happening — the fact
that citizen-led projects beginning as weekend prototypes are at might
be able to compete with commercial products — demonstrates just how much
potential these events have to create value and serve as a new form of&amp;nbsp;participation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hackathons jumpstart change. These events build relationships between
disciplines, mine data for new useful content, develop new technology
approaches, create economic value, propel &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; education, provide
prototypes for experimentation - often at a much lower cost than other
more traditional&amp;nbsp;approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has continually expressed its long-time commitment to &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;transparency
and accountability&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/"&gt;disseminating its open data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/peo.html"&gt;encouraging
participatory exploration&lt;/a&gt;, and we are excited to continue to advocate
for hackathons (including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt;
partnership) as we demonstrate &lt;strong&gt;what is possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;– in concept, word,
and actual&amp;nbsp;prototype.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will be reaping the benefits of the International Space Apps
Challenge for a very long time.”&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEMIQOBXH3H_LPgmes_0.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. For more information about the App Camp, go to the main page
&lt;a href="http://www.app-camp.eu/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt; App Camp didn’t see canoeing or campfires. Developers
worked diligently despite the Mediterranean heat to create applications
for mobile phones that bring Earth observation and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; services to the
everyday&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ending today at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESRIN&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt;’s centre for Earth observation, in Frascati,
Italy, 21 developers from 17 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EU&lt;/span&gt; Member States spent the week
creating mobile applications – or apps – using satellite&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal was to come up with some innovative and off the beaten track
ideas for apps using Earth-monitoring data on smartphones, in particular
by calling on the possibilities offered by the Global Monitoring for
Environment and Security (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In groups of four, each team worked to create an app under the following
categories: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; for Everyday Life, Observe and Learn, Play the GaMES
and Discovering Climate Change with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a balmy Friday afternoon, developers of the ShareAware app won the
challenge. Their app aims to interconnect people concerned about the
environment to understand, learn about, be prepared for or react to
various events or remote sensing&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organised by environmental ‘themes’, such as water, air quality,
deforestation or disasters, users could browse the datasets and report
on a certain issue relevant for that theme and location – a&amp;nbsp;‘callout’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users could write a short message or post an image in their callouts.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; products would also be made available for reference in the various
thematic&amp;nbsp;areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the winning team were each presented with an&amp;nbsp;iPad3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other apps developed during the week included the educational app
GEOLife that shows how Earth observation data can affect our daily
lives. TeakGuard aims to protect rainforests from illegal logging,
4Sense is in the game category and EnviSim attempts to simulate the
effect of policy decisions and technical developments on Earth’s climate
and&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants of the App Camp are encouraged to submit their apps to the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt; App Challenge by 16 September for the chance to win support by one
of the seven &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt; Business Incubation Centres, valued at €60&amp;nbsp;000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Challenge is an initiative of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ESA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; Space Office to promote
awareness of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; to a wider community. It complements the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; Master
Prize competition, which awards prizes for the best projects and
business ideas involving commercial &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; applications. It supports the
development of market-oriented applications that use data from the&amp;nbsp;programme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Camp was devised by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMES&lt;/span&gt; Space Office and co-sponsored by
the Technology Transfer Programme&amp;nbsp;Office.&lt;/p&gt;

Roekel&lt;/a&gt; is cross-posted from the White House blog. We post it here to
provoke ongoing discussion about the implications of the Digital
Strategy for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and other government&amp;nbsp;agencies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Internet revolution arrived in the 1990s, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; Government
embraced this new medium to interact with the American people. Today,
what started as basic information pages has evolved into sophisticated
transactional systems that allow us to pay taxes online, download
medical records, and so much&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the 1990s, we are now in the midst of another important shift in
how people consume and deliver information and services. In 2011, global
smartphone shipments exceeded personal computer shipments for the first
time in history, and more Americans will soon access the Internet via
mobile devices than desktop PCs. The rise of mobile further compounds
the challenge of providing high-quality digital services in a
cost-effective and efficient&amp;nbsp;manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s why President Obama issued a directive today to make important
services accessible from your phone and charged me with developing a
comprehensive strategy to build a 21st Century Digital Government that
delivers better digital services to the American&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today marks the launch of that &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html#top"&gt;Digital Government Strategy&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML5&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, the strategy takes a coordinated, information- and
customer-centric approach to changing how the government works and
delivers services to the American people. Designing for openness from
the start – making open data the default for government &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; systems and
embracing the use of web APIs – enables us to more easily deliver
information and services through multiple channels, including mobile,
and engage the public and America’s entrepreneurs as partners in
building a better&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treating the government as an open platform in this way encourages
innovation. Just look at how the government’s release of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPS&lt;/span&gt; and weather
data fueled billion dollar industries. It also makes government more
efficient and able to adapt to inevitable changes in&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next 12 months, you will start to see an important shift across
the Federal Government. Agencies will increasingly open up their
valuable data to the public and set up Developer pages to give external
developers tools to build new services. To make sure there’s no wrong
door for accessing government data, we will transform &lt;a href="http://www.data.gov/"&gt;Data.gov&lt;/a&gt; into
a data and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; catalog that in real time pulls directly from agency
websites. Agencies will mobilize two of their priority customer-facing
services, moving us closer to serving the American people anytime,
anywhere, on the device of their choice. We will do all of this while
reworking the Federal government’s own use of mobile – saving taxpayer
dollars and providing better service by bringing consistency to the way
we buy and build for an increasingly mobile&amp;nbsp;workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As President Obama has said, “I want us to ask ourselves every day, how
are we using technology to make a real difference in people’s lives?”
Through the Digital Government Strategy, we look forward to partnering
with America’s innovators – government, industry, and citizen leaders –
to implement the President’s&amp;nbsp;vision.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="digital strategy"></category><category term="Innovation"></category><category term="mobile apps"></category><category term="White House"></category></entry><entry><title>Keepin’ It Cool: 2012 NASA Commercial Innovation of the Year</title><link href="/keepin-it-cool-2012-nasa-commercial-innovation-of-the-year" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-15T12:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Samantha Snabes</name></author><id>tag:,2012-06-15:keepin-it-cool-2012-nasa-commercial-innovation-of-the-year</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Each year, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; celebrates one invention out of the many “spinoff”
technologies that the agency inspires as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Commercial Innovation
of the Year.  This past spring, the prestigious title was bestowed on a
solar refrigeration solution designed to support life on the moon, but
has huge application here on Earth.   With approximately 2 billion of
Earth’s inhabitants without electricity, the technology developed at
Johnson Space Center boasts not only commercial potential, but the
opportunity to significantly impact the lives of those in remote&amp;nbsp;areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solar refrigeration technology, which has resulted in three patents,
was originally intended to cool habitats in space. However,
co-developers Michael Ewert and David Bergeron, who worked on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Advanced Thermal Team acknowledged the need for a comparable solar
refrigerator that could operate in conjunction with the simple solar
lighting systems already in place on Earth. Working together they
modified the lunar “solar photovoltaic heat pump” device to produce a
refrigerator with a vapor compression, battery-free cooling system that
converts electricity from solar photovoltaic panels into thermal energy
that is stored internally using low-cost phase-change materials.  Now
licensed to &lt;a href="http://www.sundanzer.com"&gt;SunDanzer Refrigeration Inc&lt;/a&gt;, the proven system
eliminates reliance on an electric grid, requires no batteries, and
stores thermal energy for efficient use when sunligh&lt;em&gt;t is absent. 
Designed to work just about anywhere in the world, the current
direct-drive solar refrigerator is a chest-type cabinet with a 105-liter
internal volume, a lockable top-opening door, a corrosion-resistant
coated steel exterior, and a low-frost&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Solar Refrigerator" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SolarFrig-685x1024.jpg" title="SolarFrig" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making a&amp;nbsp;Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a scalable, energy-efficient resource can be an incredible asset
where people don’t yet have refrigeration, including remote automated
weather stations, forest stations, cabins, vacation houses, eco-friendly
resorts, farms, street vendor carts, remote medical centers,
transportation vehicles and underdeveloped&amp;nbsp;areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in a recent exciting development, SunDanzer has developed
and is marketing one of the first battery-free solar-powered
refrigerators suitable for safely storing vaccines. This unit received
World Health Organization precertification in November 2011. Now those
“without access to electricity that is essential for storage of vaccines
and medicine”…can…”greatly reduce the cost and increase the availability
of vaccines delivered to the poorest, neediest people in remote regions&amp;#8221;
says Jim Airola, director of business development at SunDanzer.  And
according to Michael Ewert, this is just the beginning.   Ewert says
“The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; battery-free solar technology could be used to cool milk,
produce or other consumer products in under-developed regions around the
world, thus creating economic opportunities and improving lives on&amp;nbsp;Earth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want More&amp;nbsp;Information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology is part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Innovative Partnerships Program, which
seeks to transfer technology into and out of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to benefit the space
program and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; industry. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; invites companies to inquire about the
licensing possibilities for the Solar-Powered Refrigeration Technology
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSC&lt;/span&gt;-22970). For information about this and other technology licensing

&lt;p&gt;It is an amazing rapid prototyping environment that is like a
Hackathon on the ocean&amp;nbsp;floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/44088059?portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ff9933" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, we had the chance to meet &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Eerrp"&gt;Eric Stackpole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/davidtlang"&gt;David
Lang&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. They had
submitted a challenged called “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/openrov-framework-development"&gt;OpenROV Framework Development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” with
the goal to “&lt;em&gt;further the development of hardware, software, and
communications interfaces to visually and bathymetrically map the ocean
floor, in an opensource fashion&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; captured our interest,
not only because it was one of the top globally recognized solutions
submitted during the event, but because it’s exactly the open source,
observation-class &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROV&lt;/span&gt; (remotely operated vehicle) we have been looking
for! &lt;em&gt;Let me&amp;nbsp;explain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During last year’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 mission, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Initiative
built a software platform to engage citizen scientists in helping us
[crowdsource the analysis of the coral reef around the Aquarius
habitat][]. The effort was an overwhelming success. In just over a week,
over 300 citizen scientists discovered over 12,000 features, and
confirmed (or disputed) each others observations over 22,000 times.
Crowdsourcing techniques such as these are being considered in the
overall exploration approach, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; plans missions to distant worlds,
including&amp;nbsp;asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plans for &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; couldn’t have fit more perfectly with our
hopes of &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/19/crowdsourcing-science-at-neemo-15/"&gt;crowdsourcing science during the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt; mission&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of
the &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; project has been to create an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROV&lt;/span&gt; that is low-cost and
able to be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts, but also capable of
doing scientific research. A secondary goal of the project has been to
cultivate a community of citizen science contributors to the design and
implementation of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROV&lt;/span&gt;. The contributors consist of both professional
and amateur underwater robotics&amp;nbsp;enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promise of &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; is that citizens around the world can create
their own open hardware and help us explore our world. This is why we
invited &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Eerrp"&gt;Eric Stackpole&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/davidtlang"&gt;David Lang&lt;/a&gt; to join &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/gerty"&gt;Chris Gerty&lt;/a&gt;
and I at the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mission to see how we might combine the open
software and open hardware technology we have collectively developed. If
you aren’t familiar with &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; analog mission that
sends groups of astronauts, engineers and scientists to live in
Aquarius, the world&amp;#8217;s only undersea research station, for weeks at a
time. As &lt;a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/author/bjmclaughlin/"&gt;Brian McGlaughlin&lt;/a&gt; describes it, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;an amazing
rapid prototyping environment that is like a Hackathon on the ocean
floor&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; The Aquarius habitat and its surroundings provide a useful
analog for space exploration. The ocean floor is largely uncharted
terrain, has potential to be explored in great detail, and has the need
to send people to only the most interesting of locations - much the same
is true of our potential off-planet&amp;nbsp;destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team’s focus during &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-16&lt;/a&gt; was specifically to
demonstrate how open hardware can be used to take imagery of local
undersea environments, and then feed this data into applications that
visualize or crowdsource the analysis, in order that we might better
understand extreme environments. From a technical perspective, the test
evaluated the opportunity for incorporating open source hardware
technology into the program, learning both the benefits and challenges
of an open, distributed development network. The larger benefit of
incorporating &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; is the potential for the engagement and
involvement of the general public. By using a low-cost, open source
product, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; aims to involve public contributions to their missions as
well as inspire citizen scientists to experiment and explore in their
own backyards. Our objectives for the week were simply&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Establish physical and software techniques to minimize effect of
    ocean currents and sea states on a lightweight &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROV&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Develop techniques to generate a geotagged imagery dataset of the&amp;nbsp;reef,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrate ability to provide real-time situational awareness to
    ongoing &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; seafloor activities,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface with other objectives of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-16&lt;/a&gt; and evaluate
    use of &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; technology for future&amp;nbsp;missions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://openrov.com/"&gt;OpenROV&lt;/a&gt; performed spectacularly during the test and the
technology demonstration was a success, which enabled the team to
experiment a bit more using the platform. An undersea sensor package
used by science teams at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-16 was attached to the OpenROV and
evaluated. Also, images of Aquarius gathered by various underwater
&lt;a href="http://gopro.com/"&gt;GoPro&lt;/a&gt; cameras were processed by &lt;a href="http://www.123dapp.com/"&gt;Autodesk’s 123D&lt;/a&gt; image software
to attempt a three-dimensional mapping of structure on the ocean floor.

Analysis Tool R2012a, the latest in a line of beta feature-development
releases that we’ve been putting out for the past five years. This is an
important milestone for the project: earlier this year our team switched
almost entirely to validation, documentation, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;QA&lt;/span&gt; in preparation for
our first production-quality release, currently scheduled for early next
year. R2012a represents a feature-complete preview of that&amp;nbsp;release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov/project/general-mission-analysis-tool/"&gt;General Mission Analysis Tool&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;) is a space trajectory
simulation, analysis, and optimization system developed by a team made
up of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Goddard Space Flight Center and private industry partners. It
is developed as open source under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Source Agreement: not
only is the source code for each release available for download, but the
primary development repository is hosted publicly at
&lt;a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmat/"&gt;SourceForge.net&lt;/a&gt;. Here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSFC&lt;/span&gt;, it’s been used as a primary or
secondary design tool on many of our most exciting missions: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCROSS&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARTEMIS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LRO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSIRIS&lt;/span&gt;, and others. And externally, it’s been used by
entities as varied as the Air Force Research Lab, Iowa State University,
and the European Space Agency. Contributors to this release included
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSFC&lt;/span&gt; civil servants, Thinking Systems Inc., and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;A.I.&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The R2012a release offers some exciting improvements from the last year
of&amp;nbsp;development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground track plot&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; can now show a two-dimensional ground
    track of your spacecraft on any planet or celestial body you&amp;nbsp;choose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Orbit Designer&lt;/strong&gt;:Now you can design an (Earth-centered) orbit as
    easily as choosing a type and a small set of defining parameters.
    For example, a geostationary orbit can now be created with just one&amp;nbsp;click.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Preview features&lt;/strong&gt;: We’ve included previews of an eclipse locator
    feature, which can detect when a spacecraft will enter and exit
    shadow regions, and of a C-language interface to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;’s modeling&amp;nbsp;features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Many others&lt;/strong&gt;: This version of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; includes many smaller
    improvements to its modeling capabilities, performance, and&amp;nbsp;usability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, this is the last of the feature-driven beta versions
that we’ve been releasing since 2007. As of this spring, we’ve switched
almost entirely to quality improvement. We’re making a full sweep
through the system, going feature-by-feature and making sure everything
is spec’d, tested, and documented, all leading to our first production
release this winter. The coming year is going to be an important one for
the project: the production version will open the doors for
collaboration and public engagement far beyond their current levels, and
we’re working hard to get ourselves into a position to take advantage of
that. Look for many changes to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;’s public-facing infrastructure and
community development efforts in the coming&amp;nbsp;months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need your help to make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; a success: please subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/gmat-betatest"&gt;beta

brought into a world of openness. In less than a week of starting with
the Open Government Initiative at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, I have become surrounded by a
spectrum of intelligent, enthusiastic and innovative people behind some
of the most outstanding causes to date. Presently, I am living in one of
the most exciting cities in America, and have the dream opportunity to
not only listen in on these discussions, but to be involved in the&amp;nbsp;formula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide context to my story, I am currently in my 4th year of 5 at
Syracuse University up north, studying Industrial and Interaction Design
(which is really just a fancy phrase for physical and digital products).
A few months ago, if you would have asked me where I’d be right now, I
would never have imagined something to this scope. While working in
government may seem like an anomaly for someone creative like me, it may
surprise you to find that this talent is the seeping through the cracks
of a conventional system from multiple directions. The reason behind
“why” so may incredible people are gathering around this movement is
because the vision of openness is&amp;nbsp;alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between moving from event to event, I had the luck to tour &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;
facility and get a sneak peek into the environment astronauts work, as
well as live. One of my many lasting memories was hopping on &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/rgaran/"&gt;Ron
Garan&lt;/a&gt;’s boat with the Open Government Team. I listened in on stories
of his journeys, which gave him affordances to transition into guiding
compelling and sustainable efforts. Moreover, these stories felt like
encapsulated memories from the human bank. &lt;strong&gt;The stories he was sharing
were not singular, but were faceted with human&amp;nbsp;understanding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, which establish themselves on universal
principles of answering unknown questions, exist for expansive periods.
However, many times these organizations are lost in an antiquated
perspective. In short, the inspiring thoughts of the 20th century are
still valuable, but the variables have changed and evolved. The public
is turning on its radar to gamification models (and the like), which are
on the upswing of technology. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is known for it’s cool factor, but
it’s so closed off from the public that it’s difficult to understand the
importance of those 20th century ideals and how they apply today. &lt;strong&gt;Open
Government has ignited a sense of passion in me that has been latent,
providing me with the chance to fall in love with the quintessential
knowledge embedded within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The celestial stars of policy,
transparency, and innovation are finally in alignment, and people are&amp;nbsp;interested.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/space/"&gt;sp.ace&lt;/a&gt;, which is the collaboration destination for the team, was
another surprising turn in my week. We stopped in and sat down wherever
we wanted, and drew on the tables to work through ideas. Not only that,
background music was provided by mentor in-chief Ali Llewellyn, with a
view of the Liquid Galaxy, and sat in chairs designed by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDEO&lt;/span&gt; (possibly
the most influential product design firm). Not only can I use what I see
for visual inspiration, but I can actually start making things, with the
sp.ace’s very own MakerBot. The sp.ace has vision that exceeds anything
that I was expecting for team partnership, and I can’t wait to go&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="space" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/space-1024x764.jpg" title="space" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Open” ideology is distinct from any other effort you see in a
Government setting. Many popular and disruptive movements today
articulate these omnipresent notions bred within us, which surface
through the human relationships we foster. Social applications aren’t
only “cool”, but they allow a kind of communication which champions
fate. &lt;strong&gt;Openness isn’t just communicating honest opinions, but it’s
truly allowing a sense of comfort and trust to thrive in the work you’re&amp;nbsp;doing. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Starting June 15, the Tocorime’ Pamatojare, Brazil’s
largest sailing ship, will host the kick off of “&lt;a href="http://followingdarwin.tocorime.net/TOCORIME_-_FOLLOWING_DARWIN_EXPEDITION/EXPEDITION.html"&gt;Following Darwin&lt;/a&gt;”,
an environmentally focused educational outreach expedition along the
coast of Brazil. For five days in June in Rio de Janeiro harbor, school
kids, teachers, community leaders, and the public will be welcomed
aboard to see and hear about the upcoming voyage of the Tocorime’
Pamatojare, which means “Adventurous Spirit” in Portuguese, to sail to
the ports of call of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMS&lt;/span&gt; Beagle. The theme of the expedition is
Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development as it relates to
the coastal environs of Brazil. These events, exhibits, and public talks
coincide with the &lt;a href="http://www.uncsd2012.org/"&gt;United Nations Rio +20 Conference on Sustainable
Development&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publicly available astronaut photography taken aboard the International
Space Station (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;) will provide the big view; showing off the beauty of
the Brazilian coast while helping to link the ecosystems, marine
biology, and oceanography with coastal development. Astronauts such as
&lt;a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/barratt-mr.html"&gt;Mike Barratt&lt;/a&gt; add the human exploration perspective, linking the
crews of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; to the crews of the tall ships and the Beagle’s voyage
180 years&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The educational and public outreach events in Brazil are just one
example of the growing use of astronaut photography  to teach and learn
about life on Earth. The image collections are cataloged and maintained
by the Crew Earth Observation &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; payload team at Johnson Space Center
and the &lt;a href=""&gt;Astromaterials Research and Explorations Science (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARES&lt;/span&gt;)
Directorate&lt;/a&gt;. Through the &lt;a href="http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov%20"&gt;Gateway to Astronaut Photography&lt;/a&gt;, the
public can find collections such as Earth from Space, images from the
International Polar Year, or the wildly popular [time sequence videos of
auroras, city lights, coastal regions, and celestial&amp;nbsp;phenomena][].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2009, a team of marine biologists and oceanographers from
around South America, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt;, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; met in Paraty, Brazil for the
first educational outreach event aboard the Tocorime’ and in area
schools. Organized by the &lt;a href="http://www.hmsbeagleproject.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMS&lt;/span&gt; Beagle Project&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; charity, the
event also featured &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; astronaut photography and a live ham-radio call
from Mike Barratt on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; to the kids of Paraty. The event was a
great success with a variety of hands-on marine biology experiences for
the kids, including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; sequencing of marine organisms in Paraty harbor
led by a biologist from the &lt;a href="http://www.barcodeoflife.org/"&gt;Barcode of Life Project&lt;/a&gt;. More such
events are planned for Following Darwin as it begins to circumnavigate
South America beginning in&amp;nbsp;September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners for the Rio+20 events include the host educational institution
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IASEA&lt;/span&gt; (Institutio Para Aprendizagem Social, Emocional e Academica) and
the tall-ship &lt;a href="www.tocorime.net%20"&gt;Tocorime’&lt;/a&gt;, the University of Sao Paolo – Zoology
Museum and Oceanographic Institute, the Brazilian Ministry of the
Environment and Ministry of Culture, National Geographic-Brazil, the
British Council, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMS&lt;/span&gt; Beagle Project. Once again, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
astronaut photography and science education and outreach programs will
play a&amp;nbsp;part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronaut photography also serves as a focal point for &lt;a href="http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/ares/eeab"&gt;Expedition Earth
and Beyond&lt;/a&gt;. This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARES&lt;/span&gt; education program is designed to
facilitate student-driven, authentic research projects to study the
Earth and to compare Earth to other planetary bodies such as the Moon
and Mars. Images of Earth acquired by astronauts are the hook for
getting students interested and involved in the&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future looks bright for all of these partners; greater involvement
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; public resources from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;, a possible circumnavigation of
South America on a tall-ship following the voyage of Darwin’s Beagle,
and opportunities for thousands of kids to learn about the importance of
Earth science, protection of the environment, and sustainable living.
Tall-ships, space ships, and kids learning about the Earth; a great mix&amp;nbsp;indeed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope you&amp;#8217;ll stay tuned and follow the adventure!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll be following
the Tocorime&amp;#8217;s explorations over the next few weeks - feel free to leave
a note here to share with the crew and the students. You can also follow

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; State Department and the Veteran Affairs Innovation Initiative to
advance the use of open source software in government, is under way. The
event will be held June 20-21 at the Robert H. Smith School of Business
at the University of Maryland in College Park,&amp;nbsp;Md.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit will convene leaders from government and industry as well as
software practitioners to discuss the development, release and use of
open source software, which is characterized by a collaborative
development process and free user&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussion topics will include the current and future state of the
government open source community, how-to insights for open source
projects in government, real-world projects and their successes and
challenges, and government procurement of open source&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the role of open source in government expands and matures, the
relationship between technology, policy and culture will be increasingly
important. Open source brings numerous benefits to government software
projects, including increased software quality, reduced development
costs, faster development cycles and reduced barriers to public-private
collaboration through new opportunities to commercialize technology.
This inherently transparent, participatory, and collaborative approach
is revolutionizing the way software is created, improved and&amp;nbsp;used.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Nebula, NASA, and OpenStack</title><link href="/nebula-nasa-and-openstack" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-04T15:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-06-04:nebula-nasa-and-openstack</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; This post by Ray O’Brien (Former Nebula Project Manager, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames
Research Center &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt;, Acting) was originally posted to
&lt;a href="http://nebula.nasa.gov/"&gt;nebula.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;. The Nebula Cloud Computing Platform was the
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/nebula.html"&gt;Flagship Initiative for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s first Open Government Plan&lt;/a&gt;, and much
has been learned, accomplished, and created over the course of this
project. Thanks to the team who worked so hard and invested so much in
this groundbreaking&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we started Nebula in 2008, it was for a somewhat different purpose
than what it eventually became. Under the project name &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.net, we
initially set out to consolidate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s web space onto a unified
platform. By offering common web development tools and resources as a
centralized service, it was hoped that a convergence effect could be
achieved that would result in heightened efficiency and greater
visibility into a diverse array of Agency&amp;nbsp;activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with so many great startup stories, in building this system and
advocating for its use, it became apparent that flexible infrastructure
was a prerequisite to the platform layer. Still with the aim of tackling
the web problem, the team took a step back and set out to characterize
the state of generic, on-demand, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;-driven compute and storage systems.
At this point, two interesting things happened. One, we found the state
of open systems for enabling cloud-like infrastructure service delivery
to be in an early state of development with low overall supported
capacity. Second, we noticed considerable opportunity for providing
infrastructure as a service in the communities we were courting for the
platform layer. With the confluence of these two findings, the team
decided to pivot into the infrastructure layer. We eventually came upon
the name “Nebula” and set about the construction of an open source
compute&amp;nbsp;controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, on the first open source release of our Nova controller, we found
that Rackspace had taken a strikingly similar technical approach to
their storage systems and were set to begin the construction of a
compute controller just as we were preparing to focus on storage. Given
our technical alignment and with the open source release of Rackspace’s
Swift storage software, we joined forces to create &lt;a href="http://openstack.org"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;. Our
hope was that a community would form around these two pieces of software
toward the construction of an open source cloud operating system. To say
that our greatest hopes in this regard were met would be an
understatement. &lt;a href="http://openstack.org/"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; today has the support of hundreds of
individuals and organizations around the world, all set on realizing the
original vision for the&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, on May 15, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; announced a new cloud computing strategy for
the Agency at the Uptime Institute’s symposium in Santa Clara, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;. Among
its facets is a reduction to our OpenStack development efforts in favor
of becoming a “smart consumer” of commercial cloud services. In
understanding this shift, it is important to consider that the majority
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s code contributions to OpenStack were during its early stages
while its developer and industry communities were still forming. Since
those early days, the &lt;a href="http://openstack.org/"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; community has grown considerably,
and we have borne witness to accelerated development in key areas
directly bearing on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s originally identified needs. In fact, the
vast majority of code contributions over the past year of intense
OpenStack development have come from community members other than &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the community continues to overtake many of our original internal
development objectives, it is appropriate that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; ramp down its
involvement with &lt;a href="http://openstack.org/"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; in-line with our announcement at the
Uptime Conference. We celebrate this milestone in OpenStack’s
development: it has reached a point of self-sustaining growth along a
community-driven trajectory such that the project will continue to go
forward without our direct involvement. This outcome has always been one
of our highest goals for Nebula, and now permits us to transition from
the role of developer to that of enthusiastic adopter of a broad range
of cloud services, including those based on OpenStack, delivered by a
larger number of cloud providers and vendors than existed when the
Nebula project was started. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a rich heritage of developing and
transferring technology to the private sector for continued commercial
development, and OpenStack adds one more stunningly successful entry to
that&amp;nbsp;list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it is true that our public development activities will no longer
be a driving force in OpenStack, should a special requirement be
identified by a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; project wishing to use OpenStack in the future, the
possibility of contributing can be explored on a project-by-project
basis. That’s the beauty of the community driven open source development
model and the key reason Nova, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s contribution to OpenStack, was
developed as open source software in the first&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement should not be interpreted in any way as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; abandoning
or being dissatisfied with OpenStack and its community. Nothing could be
further from the truth &amp;#8212; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is extremely proud of its role in helping
to create the OpenStack community. With that success firmly established
and many in the industry now likening &lt;a href="http://openstack.org/"&gt;OpenStack&lt;/a&gt; to the “Linux of
the cloud,” we are turning our attention to exploring how available
cloud solutions of all types can best be used to address a broad set of
Agency&amp;nbsp;requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Ames Research Center"></category><category term="cloud computing"></category><category term="code.nasa.gov"></category><category term="Nebula"></category><category term="Open Source"></category><category term="Open Stack"></category></entry><entry><title>Space Apps: Lessons in Global Innovation</title><link href="/space-apps-lessons-in-global-innovation" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-06-01T10:42:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Haley Stephenson</name></author><id>tag:,2012-06-01:space-apps-lessons-in-global-innovation</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haley Stephenson’s excellent article first appeared in Volume 5, Issue

&lt;p&gt;Lessons from a global innovation event may inspire new ways to solve
project-based challenges&amp;nbsp;concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Paul MacCready decided to contend for the 1959 Kremer Prize, which
would reward the first person to fly a human-powered plane across the
English Channel, he had an insight about how to approach the engineering
challenge: fail fast. Instead of taking months or years to build and
test a specific design, MacCready took hours or maybe days by using
materials that would allow him to rebuild a failed plane quickly.
MacCready and his Gossamer Condor aircraft won the prize because he was
able to innovate within a fraction of the time of his
competitors—iterating design modifications, gaining new knowledge, and
learning from failure faster than the&amp;nbsp;rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decades later, on the morning of April 21, 2012, over 2,000 registered
participants from 7 continents, 17 countries, 24 cities, and 111
organizations drew upon the same innovative spirit that inspired
MacCready. Together, participants tackled 40-plus challenges posed by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; over the course of one weekend during the first &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International
Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. (Forty-eight hours is not a lot of time, but
remember that in 1970, Apollo 13 mission engineers devised a solution
for the carbon dioxide filtration problem in just two days.) Challenge
statements spanned four main categories—citizen science, software,
hardware, and data visualization—and involved mobile app development,
infographics, robot design and modification, and educational tools to
engage the public in the story of&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first glance, the benefits from the Space Apps Challenge might only
seem to pertain to education, citizen science, and public outreach. Like
the Gossamer Condor, though, the Space Apps Challenge can provide
insights about the learning process involved in tackling challenges.
&amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is generating incredible amounts of data,” said Elizabeth Walker
Sabet, a mass-collaboration project lead from SecondMuse, which
coordinated global operations for the event. “If you put that data out
to a diverse community, it enables [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;] to have numerous and
distributed backup teams around the world digging into the data,
figuring out what sort of valuable information can come from it and what
can be done with&amp;nbsp;it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to predict in advance the gains from an event like this.
“The innovation that can come out of it has the potential to be
astounding,” said Brian McLaughlin, a lead for simulator development on
the Joint Polar Satellite System, in a Gov2.0 Radio Podcast. “We might
get stuff out of the challenge that is completely&amp;nbsp;unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the &amp;#8220;fail fast&amp;#8221; approach, the Space Apps Challenge also
demonstrated two other elements valuable to projects. The first is data
transparency. Solving a puzzle requires having the pieces first. For
each of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s challenge statements, data and content needed to be
openly available and accessible. While &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; projects could not release
sensitive data to Space Apps innovators, many provided critical
information that helped to address specific challenges. &amp;#8220;One challenge
resulted in the creation of a converter to take satellite image data in
a certain format to .png, a more usable format,” said Christopher Gerty,
a member of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Team. “What that did was lower the
barrier of&amp;nbsp;entry.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second element is partnership. Space Apps enabled new kinds of
relationships with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. “It was more than just gaining access to data
and creating something new,” said Sean Herron, also a member of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Open Government Team. “The participants in Nairobi felt like partners
with the United States, with the rest of the world. With events going on
all over the globe simultaneously, they felt they were a part of a
collective movement to further &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission, further space&amp;nbsp;exploration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The closest I&amp;#8217;ve come to space is through the Internet,&amp;#8221; said Allan
Onchuru, software developer at iHub, a collective that brings together
innovators and entrepreneurs in Nairobi. “I usually work on web and
mobile applications, but today I wanted to try out some&amp;nbsp;robotics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging global brainpower over the course of two days resulted in
several challenge winners. But for most participants, the event was a
beginning, not an end. The International Space Apps Challenge served as
a springboard to solve problems, and collaborative technology continues
to connect and enable teams of innovators to tackle space exploration&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(With) the interconnectedness that we have in the world now, you can
get people with so many different ideas and experience levels and
backgrounds that can approach problems from a perspective that you would
never even consider,” said Clay Ellis, a McMurdo Ground Station operator
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Space Communications Network Services (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCNS&lt;/span&gt;) project, in a
Gov2.0 Radio Podcast interview. “Just the amount of creativity there is
and the hundreds of ways there are to solve problems….This is how
problems are going to be solved in the&amp;nbsp;future.”&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="collaboration"></category><category term="Innovation"></category><category term="international"></category><category term="Open Data"></category><category term="Open Government Partnership"></category><category term="Participation"></category><category term="space apps"></category></entry><entry><title>NASA Challenges featured at Random Hacks of Kindness</title><link href="/nasa-challenges-featured-at-random-hacks-of-kindness" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-29T14:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-05-29:nasa-challenges-featured-at-random-hacks-of-kindness</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the key elements of the Random Hacks of Kindness Sustainability
Project announced earlier this year was to create a &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/rhok-featured-problem-set-june-2012"&gt;featured problem
set&lt;/a&gt; for each RHoK event going forward that provides a series of
highly curated, well-defined problems that have clear sponsors and clear
paths to sustained impact. Stay on top of the latest additions for RHoK
2012 at our &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/FeaturedProblems"&gt;Featured Problem Set Page&lt;/a&gt;. Here we detail &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s two
focused challenges for the RHoK community, both building off of the
success of the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/complete-view-iss"&gt;Complete View from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; We have an amazing amount of crew imagery coming down
daily from the International Space Station - time lapse images, star
trails views, and spectacular photos that give citizens of Earth an
unparalleled perspective of their home planet. Astronaut photography is
a vital resource that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is committed to making accessible and useful
internally and&amp;nbsp;externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to build an immersive view from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; in any direction,
nadir, limb-ward and star-ward, as the views are available. We want to
create a mechanism to allow organizing/tagging/crowdsourcing of
information that would improve the usability of the imagery for science
and educational projects. We want to create an OpenStreetMap-type
database that’s actually an&amp;nbsp;“OpenStarMap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; The impact of this app is limited only by your
imagination. You are providing everyone an opportunity to see and engage
with our home planet with a perspective so far only available to a few
hundred human beings. Who knows how the orbital perspective could shape
life for the rest of&amp;nbsp;us?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After RHoK:&lt;/strong&gt; The Human Exploration Science Office is committed to
these goals and the accessibility of these images. Apps that meet the
requirements in a clean and easy-to-use way have a likelihood of
adoption in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s citizen science/open data&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/phonesat-android-apps-space"&gt;PhoneSat: Android Apps for&amp;nbsp;Space&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; This challenge is a chance to be a part of
kick-starting the public’s access to space – and using open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COTS&lt;/span&gt;
technology to do so. PhoneSat is a low-cost Cubesat using a Google Nexus
Smartphone running the open source Android platform as the main
processor. Our challenge for you is to create an Android App that
utilizes PhoneSat’s&amp;nbsp;capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App that you create should be designed to run during a dedicated
mission phase lasting approximately one 90 minute orbital period; you
could choose to use any portion or all of this time. During this phase
you would have access to all of the phone sensors: magnetometer,
gyroscope, and accelerometer in addition to the PhoneSat sensors and
controls: thermometer, reaction wheels, magnetorquer boards, and solar
panel&amp;nbsp;current.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are unique challenges to developing apps and receiving data in a
microgravity environment. These conditions will alter the performance of
PhoneSat’s sensors. Half of your testing orbit will be in eclipse, which
will be responsible for a thermal cycle. Atmospheric drag will be the
primary source of attitude disturbance. The Earth’s magnetic field at
the orbit altitude would have a similar magnitude to that at sea level.
Finally, the satellite may be tumbling with the determination of an
approximate&amp;nbsp;attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you up for the&amp;nbsp;challenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Impact:&lt;/strong&gt; These apps have the potential to impact the burgeoning
commercial space industry and be an early influencer in approaches to
citizen science in microgravity. This is relatively unexplored territory
– and you get to be a part of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After RHoK:&lt;/strong&gt; The PhoneSat Project team, based at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames
Research Center, is committed to engaging citizens in their efforts to
test and fly these apps in space. Apps that meet the requirements in a
creative and effective way are likely to have an opportunity to fly in
space in the near future. More info on the plans for the project are
found here: &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/phonesat/"&gt;http://open.nasa.gov/plan/phonesat/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Spring 2012 issue of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASK&lt;/span&gt; Magazine, found &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask/issues/46/46s_digital_astronaut.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. We are
cross-posting it here as a great example of the intersection of

&lt;p&gt;Conducting human missions beyond low-Earth orbit to destinations such as
asteroids and Mars will require substantial work to ensure the
well-being of the crew. These new operational conditions, which will
include long periods in microgravity, will pose health risks that are
currently not well understood and perhaps unanticipated. Developing and
applying advanced tools to predict, assess, and mitigate potential
hazards to astronaut health is critical. &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hacd/project/digital-astronaut.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Digital Astronaut
Project&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt;) is working to build well-vetted computational models to
help predict and assess spaceflight health and performance risks, and
enhance countermeasure development. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; aims to accomplish these
goals through the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Partnering with subject-matter experts to address human health-risk
    knowledge gaps and countermeasure development&amp;nbsp;decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modeling, simulating, and analyzing physiological responses to
    exposure to reduced gravity and spaceflight-analog&amp;nbsp;environments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing timely information to contribute to mission architecture
    and operations decisions in areas where clinical data are&amp;nbsp;lacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve these objectives, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; follows a systematic, rigorous
process that begins by identifying human health-risk knowledge gaps that
are amenable to computational modeling. Subsequently, we work with
subject-matter experts within the Human Health Countermeasures element
of the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/humanresearch/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Human Research Program&lt;/a&gt; to narrow modeling and simulation
objectives to inform specific research questions or hypotheses. Then we
conduct a thorough field survey to identify state-of-the-art modeling
and simulation methodologies that can address the questions and
hypotheses effectively. Subsequently, the models are developed, refined,
verified, and validated to make them ready for research&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Multicenter and Multidisciplinary Collaborative Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once the models have been sufficiently vetted (an effort currently in
progress), we work with researchers or provide them models to simulate
typical spaceflight-environment scenarios. The results of the
simulations can then be interpreted by the subject-matter experts to
inform research. Additionally, results from research and flight
operations that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; informs can be used to further refine and
enhance the fidelity of our models for future use. In addition to
enhancing countermeasure development, our iterative and collaborative
approach offers other&amp;nbsp;benefits:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Substantiates anecdotal evidence regarding spaceflight health&amp;nbsp;risks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces cost of flight and ground experiments by running
    complementary simulations to further substantiate or refine
    experiments for optimal&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provides insight on the effects of long-duration spaceflight
    scenarios for which data are&amp;nbsp;lacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To ensure high-quality, repeatable results, the models are rigorously
vetted using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Standard for Models and Simulations (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STD&lt;/span&gt;-7009).
We do everything we can to validate the modeling and simulation against
spaceflight or flight-analog data to establish the highest fidelity
possible. For example, we are in the process of using on-orbit video
data of crewmembers exercising to validate the kinematics of exercise
models. We are also gathering muscle and bone data from past spaceflight
missions and bed-rest experiments to validate the capability of our
musculoskeletal models to predict the impact of exercise countermeasures
on musculoskeletal fitness. Given that models and simulations have
limitations, we clearly document the validation and application domains
of our modeling and simulation to ensure they are not applied beyond
their intended&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; is managed out of Glenn Research Center by DeVon Griffin; the
science content of the project is directed by Lealem Mulugeta of the
Universities Space Research Association (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USRA&lt;/span&gt;) in Houston at Johnson
Space Center. We work collaboratively to lead a tightly knit team of
researchers, engineers, and computational modelers located at Glenn and
Johnson to execute the project’s core mission. We conduct a weekly
tag-up teleconference to discuss planned activities for the week and
coordinate critical tasks that must be executed to meet milestones.
Lealem also meets with the multidisciplinary technical team via a weekly
teleconference to conduct highly focused technical discussions regarding
the development and implementation of modeling and simulation. DeVon
then closes out each week with a programmatic teleconference, during
which the team members provide status updates on current activities and
flag any programmatic risks that need to be addressed or tracked. If
required, the team also holds face-to-face meetings to address
high-priority issues. Finally, to keep the project and the team focused,
we have established project and science management plans to communicate
the overarching vision of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; and provide a road map that guides the
team’s&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applying Models and Simulations for Musculoskeletal Health Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; is assisting the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hacd/project/exercise-countermeasures.html"&gt;Exercise Physiology Countermeasures
Project&lt;/a&gt; (ExPC) at Johnson to model exercise countermeasures that use
the Advanced Resistive Exercise Device (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARED&lt;/span&gt;) aboard the International
Space Station. Given the complementary expertise of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; and ExPC in
computational modeling and exercise physiology, the teams established a
cooperative approach to develop and implement three exercise modules of
humans and an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARED&lt;/span&gt; device module. These model types are currently being
integrated to provide data on forces transmitted to various anatomical
locations as a result of the&amp;nbsp;exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARED&lt;/span&gt; exercise models will be integrated with bone and muscle
adaptation modules currently being developed. These models use both
terrestrial analog data and subject-matter-expert knowledge of
musculoskeletal and exercise physiology unique to spaceflight. Once
integrated with the exercise models, the bone and muscle models will
simulate the response of bone and muscle physiology to exercise
countermeasures during spaceflight missions. This will enable
researchers to conduct “what-if” analyses to gain insight into questions
such&amp;nbsp;as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is it possible to reduce the amount of exercise time and maintain
    musculoskeletal performance by increasing exercise intensity or
    eliminating some&amp;nbsp;exercises?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which exercises play the greatest role in maintaining
    musculoskeletal&amp;nbsp;performance?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the impact of unanticipated failure of exercise equipment on
    musculoskeletal health, and can the exercise regimen be reformulated
    to minimize adverse&amp;nbsp;effects?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can exercise efficacy be enhanced for individual astronauts based on
    their unique&amp;nbsp;anthropometrics?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In general, the overarching objective of this collaboration is to
develop and implement musculoskeletal modules and modeling capabilities
to customize and optimize exercise regimens based on anthropometrics and
gender. Another goal is to provide tools capable of answering unforeseen
exercise-physiology questions as they arise, as well as scalable and
extensible exercise-device modules and modeling capabilities or
platforms to evaluate the influence of exercise devices on exercise
performance and flight&amp;nbsp;hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, these tools will be used to inform ground and flight studies
aimed at addressing musculoskeletal-risk knowledge gaps regarding the
minimum amount of exercise required to maintain musculoskeletal health
and performance, and the minimum set of exercise equipment needed to
maintain musculoskeletal health and&amp;nbsp;performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint teams developed the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARED&lt;/span&gt; model in progressive stages to
gradually increase the module fidelity. The first product was a beta
version, used as a development and checkout tool for the integration
process with the biomechanics exercise modules. The teams maintain the
beta release as a development platform throughout the project because it
offers a simplified environment for checking and troubleshooting the
integrated modules. Follow-on versions provide increased fidelity,
including accurate characterization of mass, inertial and friction
properties of the device, and the vibration isolation&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work in Progress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to modeling and simulating exercise countermeasures, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; is
currently collaborating with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Bone Discipline lead within the
Human Adaptation and Countermeasures Division to apply modeling and
simulation to augment a new bone-strength standard that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
currently developing. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; team members are developing a unique
capability that will provide the first simulations of the effects of
microgravity on bone turnover. This work focuses on bone-strength
changes due to demineralization and architectural changes. It will also
be combined with biomechanical modeling to predict the loads experienced
at specific bone sites that are at greatest risk for fracture during
post-flight activities astronauts might perform, such as jumping. Based
on the outcomes of these simulations, it may be possible for clinicians
to guide the activities of astronauts in order to minimize risk of
fracture after they return from a&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; is working with the Exercise Countermeasures Project Advanced
Exercise Concept (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEC&lt;/span&gt;) device-development team at Glenn to model
advanced-concept devices with the following&amp;nbsp;goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gaining insight into the efficacy of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEC&lt;/span&gt; devices for exercise&amp;nbsp;countermeasures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Providing timely input for design, development, and refinement of
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing the time and cost to develop the exercise&amp;nbsp;devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reducing the time and cost to clinically test new exercise&amp;nbsp;devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that many of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AEC&lt;/span&gt; component prototypes will share some common
architecture, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; is developing a generalized modeling toolbox that will
make it possible to rapidly benchmark the capabilities of proposed
devices for common loading profiles. This builds on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt;’s goal to
develop scalable, extensible exercise device-simulation modules and
capabilities to rapidly and inexpensively evaluate exercise hardware
efficacy during exploration missions. As part of that goal, the models
will be able to simulate changes in exercise protocol as well, allowing
exercise physiologists to conduct what-if analyses of various exercise
prescriptions for microgravity&amp;nbsp;conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DAP&lt;/span&gt; is working with the &lt;a href="http://www.usra.edu/news/features/2012/vision/"&gt;Visual Impairment and Intracranial
Pressure&lt;/a&gt;project to address recent findings of anatomical changes of
the eye and visual performance diminution in many long-duration space
station crewmembers. Although these changes have varied in severity,
they have occurred at a much higher rate than expected. This project is
currently in the field-survey phase to identify modeling and simulation
resources that can be extended to answer key questions and test
hypotheses in this&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="collaboration"></category><category term="Exercise"></category><category term="Human Research Program"></category><category term="human spaceflight"></category><category term="Johnson Space Center"></category><category term="modeling"></category><category term="technology"></category></entry><entry><title>Bringing Home the Magic of Space</title><link href="/bringing-home-the-magic-of-space" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-23T10:22:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-05-23:bringing-home-the-magic-of-space</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The mission of the &lt;a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/"&gt;Center for the Advancement of Science in Space

International Space Apps Challenge. The &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/05/18/global-winners-announced/"&gt;top six challenges&lt;/a&gt; were
chosen from the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/05/09/spaceapps-global-judging-open-now/"&gt;29 finalists&lt;/a&gt; chosen from over &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/04/25/100-reasons-spaceapps-made-a-difference/"&gt;100 submitted
solutions&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/locations/"&gt;25 participating locations&lt;/a&gt;. But here&amp;#8217;s the thing,
there were so many incredible ideas submitted to the Space Apps
Challenge that it is almost easy to overlook some of the challenges that
were not highlighted through the global judging&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me give you an example that I&amp;#8217;ve been sharing with others when
they ask about the innovation that happened at the event.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 12:00pm on day #2 of the Space Apps Challenge. I was in Oxford,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; where some of the most innovative solutions originated. I was walking
around, documenting the event and doing interviews with some of the
participants, when I met 16 year old &lt;a href="http://www.twitter.com/angryspinach"&gt;Sam Wilkinson&lt;/a&gt;. Sam&amp;#8217;s not your
ordinary 16 year old and he also didn&amp;#8217;t have time for an interview. He
did ask a question&amp;nbsp;though&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Nick, what time does judging start this afternoon?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;4:00pm, but we&amp;#8217;ll need everyone to wrap up their work a bit earlier
so that we can make sure you get it submitted on time.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;Okay, do you think I have enough time to try to solve another
challenge? I&amp;#8217;m really interested in &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/bakerfaire/"&gt;Baker Faire&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;Um, well, do you have anyone else working on it with you?&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;No, just me.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;You better get on it then, you only have 3 and half hours max.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;#8220;Okay, I&amp;#8217;ll see what I can&amp;nbsp;do.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hours later the judging process started. The judges had a really
difficult time picking the top three teams. Sam submitted a solution
called &amp;#8220;Aeration &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Low Temperature Baking&amp;#8221;. Included here is his final
presentation along with the slides he&amp;nbsp;created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/42579559" width="580" height="320" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="4f947297812d2a001f01e5d1" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, Sam took third place in Oxford which put him one place out
of qualifying for the global judging. But that didn&amp;#8217;t slow him down. He
returned home and kept working on his idea. In an email to me a few days
later he&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Hi again, I tested my hypothesis in my school chemistry lab with
excellent results!!! Will film it tomorrow (camera broke) and send you
the&amp;nbsp;link.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the video he posted as well as an explanation from his&amp;nbsp;blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/41167953" width="580" height="321" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;By using the process of bread aeration, by which carbon dioxide is
actually forced into the bread, the only ingredients required to produce
dough are water, flour and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is mixed with
water to form a 8.4×10-2 mol/L solution of carbonic acid, as well as
excess aqueous carbon dioxide. If the partial pressure of the carbon
dioxide is maintained at 2.5 atm, this concentration of carbonic acid
will be maintained as the system enters a dynamic equilibrium between
the aqueous carbonic acid and gaseous carbon dioxide. The solution is
mixed thoroughly with ordinary flour (and any other required flavourings
i.e. salt, sugar etc.) at a (20/7):1 water:flour ratio in a sealed
container with the carbon dioxide at a consistent partial pressure of
2.5 atm (about the same pressure as carbon dioxide in a soda bottle).
The pressure in the sealed container is then released. This decrease in
pressure causes the carbonic acid which is mixed into the flour to be
converted into carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide that is evolved
from the mixture will be maintained in suspension within the mixture.
Combined with microgravity, this will cause an even, leavened dough to
be formed.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sam&amp;#8217;s solution was later picked up by &lt;a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/05/09/spacebread-rises-in-5-seconds/"&gt;Make Magazine&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Just thought you might be interested that my space bread is getting
blogged about! Here is the &lt;a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/05/09/spacebread-rises-in-5-seconds/"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to the post on
Make The video on the post is pretty cool if I do say so myself. Could
have done it on the weekend with a vacuum cleaner and fizzy&amp;nbsp;water!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an incredible example of the ingenuity we witnessed at the
International Space Apps Challenge. It&amp;#8217;s people like Sam Wilkinson that
made the event so successful. Space Bread truly showcases the potential
of participatory exploration to help solve our space exploration and
social&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Global Winners Announced</title><link href="/global-winners-announced" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-18T14:23:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2012-05-18:global-winners-announced</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/42480085?portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ff9933" width="580" height="325" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transits of Venus—the movement of Venus across the visible face of the
Sun—are special events that occur in pairs eight years apart and then
don’t happen again for more than a century. Prior to the current pair,
the last two Venus transits were in 1874 and 1882. After the transit in
2012, there won’t be another pair until 2117 and 2125. These rare
alignments have been important for scientific research, providing data
for a very close estimate of the astronomical unit ([in 1716, astronomer
Edmund Halley calculated the distance from the sun to the earth by
having observers across the globe time the passage of Venus across the
sun][]) and allowing us to develop effective techniques to &lt;a href="http://www.space.com/15713-venus-transit-sun-alien-planets.html"&gt;discover and
characterize exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;. More here on the &lt;a href="http://venustransit.nasa.gov/2012/articles/ttt_75.php"&gt;math&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://venustransit.nasa.gov/2012/articles/ttt_74.php"&gt;science&lt;/a&gt;, and

yesterday about what is so powerful about what we do here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iconic success of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is planted firmly on three foundational
elements: innovation, inspiration, and integrity. While innovation and
inspiration are visible through our endeavors and successes, &lt;em&gt;it is
our integrity – how we work, and our commitment to excellence and
openness – that earns us the trust of the public and ensures our
continued ability to inspire and innovate.&lt;/em&gt;  Integrity is woven
throughout the fabric of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.  It has always been there. And each and
every day, we recommit ourselves to keeping it&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(You can read more about the Agency&amp;#8217;s framework for scientific
integrity &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/news/reports/sif.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Innovation&lt;/strong&gt; is what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is known for. Every day we are asking new
questions and solving problems in new ways. We are &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/nasa@work.html"&gt;encouraging
innovation internally&lt;/a&gt; and building &lt;a href="http://community.topcoder.com/ntl/"&gt;innovative communities
externally&lt;/a&gt;, incubating technologies that are &lt;a href="http://launch.org/"&gt;deeply committed to
making a better world&lt;/a&gt;. We are developing &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/partnership/innovation/index.html"&gt;innovative partnerships&lt;/a&gt;
all the time to encourage cross-pollination of research and&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost all of us have wondered about life beyond Earth or dreamt of
flying in space at some point in our lives;&lt;strong&gt;inspiration&lt;/strong&gt; is the part
that seems to come so easily. Who isn&amp;#8217;t inspired by &lt;a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/big-pic-psychedelic-star-trails-iss-pettit-120514.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? Or
&lt;a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/newui/blog/viewpostlist.jsp?blogname=letters"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? Or &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2249.html"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; gives us &lt;a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/Eyes/"&gt;perspective on our planet&lt;/a&gt; -
and on &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/"&gt;what it means to be human&lt;/a&gt; - every single day. Every time I
watch brave explorers suit up and climb onto a rocket to go to space,
like I did &lt;a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/newui/blog/viewpostlist.jsp?blogname=acaba"&gt;just this week&lt;/a&gt;, I get excited again about what is and can
be&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrity&lt;/strong&gt;, however, is the commitment we make every single day.
Integrity is doing the hard work of putting things into the light -
documenting ideas, insuring safety, working through processes, truly
engaging citizens. It&amp;#8217;s what allows crewmembers to [&amp;#8220;strap themselves to
a few million pounds of explosives and trusting that everything will
work as planned.&amp;#8221;][] Sometimes it means &lt;a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/waynehalesblog/posts/post_1237212199973.html"&gt;asking hard questions about our
own issues&lt;/a&gt;. Integrity is insuring that not just the crew but the
&lt;em&gt;public&lt;/em&gt; can trust what is behind the decisions we are making - and
committing to appropriately share that information with them. The
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/about/space_act1.html"&gt;National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958&lt;/a&gt;, as amended, stipulates
that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; shall “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof.” And as the policy notes: &lt;em&gt;unless a determination is made that
public dissemination of  information must be prohibited or restricted,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; information is made available to the public&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;a href="http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_2200_002C_&amp;amp;page_name=main&amp;amp;search_term=2200%2E2"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt; 2200.2, Section
4.5.1&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully believe that this is why &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/"&gt;openness&lt;/a&gt; is so important at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as
we stay focused on such an important &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/what_does_nasa_do.html"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;. As Dr. Abdalati notes,
our &amp;#8220;awareness of the freedoms and responsibilities [that integrity
requires] will help us continue to pursue new knowledge, fuel wonder,
and make groundbreaking discoveries about the universe and our place in
it.&amp;#8221; It is also why we continue to &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/directory/"&gt;engage citizens&lt;/a&gt;, pressing forward
with &lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov/guide/"&gt;open source policy development&lt;/a&gt;, building an effective &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/"&gt;platform
for open data&lt;/a&gt;, accelerating &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/technology-accelerators/"&gt;effective technologies&lt;/a&gt;, and
strengthening the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/"&gt;open communities&lt;/a&gt; here across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a commitment that is often hard. &lt;em&gt;But it is one that is always&amp;nbsp;worthwhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;#8220;strap themselves to a few million pounds of explosives and trusting
  that everything will work as planned.&amp;#8221;]:&amp;nbsp;https://plus.google.com/116214152295449083654/posts/hEWpHBjFsqi&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="chief scientist"></category><category term="Innovation"></category><category term="Inspiration"></category><category term="integrity"></category><category term="Open Data"></category></entry><entry><title>#SpaceApps Global Judging Open Now</title><link href="/spaceapps-global-judging-open-now" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-05-09T13:36:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-05-09:spaceapps-global-judging-open-now</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;[Global voting starts today for the International Space Apps

with your votes and along with an internationally recognized jury of
investors and entrepreneurs from Innovation&amp;nbsp;Endeavors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The videos submitted on behalf of each nominated project also
demonstrate the vision of the collaboration process, the passion of the
participants, and what it means to them to engage the data in their
context. These videos tell the story about what is possible when people
get a vision about exploration and for changing the world with science.
&lt;em&gt;What earth observation data could help people, organizations, and
governments make better decisions? How can we convey the orbital
perspective to people on Earth? What are other low-cost off-the-shelf
hardware options for exploration? What are new ways we could visualize
data? How else could we communicate ideas too big for words or organize
data bigger than we have yet been able to manage? What new things can we
learn when we mashup data sources? How can we share data more
efficiently?&lt;/em&gt; Space Apps asked all these questions in the global
community - and discovered some interesting ideas and answers along the&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;

visualizes near-real time aurora data. During the Science Hack Day
Dublin in March, we built up an Aurora Lamp. This consisted on an
artistic representation of an Aurora using LEDs. However, this was not
connected with any data feed. For the Space Apps Challenge we tried to
improve this original project by using real data. On one side we
developed a program that automatically downloads and processes data from
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;POES&lt;/span&gt; satellites. This gives an indication of aurora activity.
However, as the satellites measure just what is below them the data
needs to be extrapolated to show all the hemisphere. Simultaneously, we
also developed software to generate a layer for Google Earth showing the
forecast of aurora activity. This is based on magnetic field
measurements from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACE&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft. &lt;a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/show/submission/detail/PW69PM"&gt;Vote&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

app that explores the potential of unused land for the growing of fruit,
vegetable and other crops through the use of location, climate and
growing data. The Grower&amp;#8217;s Nation application is designed to reduce the
barriers to growing by taking location, climate and growing conditions
data into consideration and aims to give more people the information
they need when selecting what to grow.  The crop dataset we are creating
is possibly the first of its kind that is available open source, and
will enable cross referencing of crop, climate, weather and soil data.
When complete, it will include the growing conditions required for
different varieties of fruit, vegetables and grains. During the
challenge weekend, we had some great collaborations with teams from
around the world including: Exeter, San Francisco, Chile, the Dominican
Republic, Nairobi and New York. We hope to continue collaborating with
related projects into the future. There is a lot of potential for follow

you like to save time, money, effort on your daily commute while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALSO&lt;/span&gt;
helping the environment? The solution we propose for the My Travel
Impact challenge does just that! By aggregating yours and others usage
data, calculating carbon usage based on the distance and mode of
transport you take, this app will provide you with a list optimised
routes detailing time, cost and carbon usage to give you ultimate
control on your journey! If even just a small percentage of smartphone
users are influenced to change their commuting habits to more
environmentally friendly modes of transport, the potential that the
MyTravel App has in the battle to reduce carbon emissions is enormous.

the data in this way, Planet Hopper aims toﾠraise interest in the new
discoveries of hundreds ofﾠplanets orbiting otherﾠstars, stimulate
questions and encourage debate about what it might be likeﾠthere,
andﾠthe plausibility, or otherwise, of life on these planets. Through a
simple interface, you choose a star using the systemﾠfinder then view
its planets. Find out how longﾠit would take to get to there,ﾠhow old
you would be if you were born there there, or how high you could
jumpﾠifﾠyou were standing on the planet&amp;#8217;s surface. Perhaps its sun is a

Ufahamu is a &amp;#8216;swahili&amp;#8217; word for Awareness. This project is based on Data
Visualization, Fragile Oasis: Map-a-Difference category. Ufahamu is a
tool that performs visualization of data related to health issues from
opendata repositories like opendata.go.ke; which it combines with
existing geo datasets from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; opendata and other reliable sources.
Additionally, Ufahamu can also perform a mash up of different datasets
establishing relationship as to how they relate. Such provides
information that can be easily understood and interpreted by
researchers, public and private &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s, interested parties, and common
persons. This is meant to arm the public with information on

Pollen Predictor that used live pollen data to change the colour of a 3D
printed pollen ball. The colour of the ball is used to represent the
next day&amp;#8217;s pollen level. So what next? We would love to develop this
into a standalone Physical App that enables people to see data. In the

in enhancing science, technology, engineering, and math (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;)
education, an important &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; goal of great importance, given
that current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; youth lag far behind other industrialized countries in
math and science skills. Partnering science with art also encourages the
development of creative and critical thinking, problem solving, and
communication skills. These abilities are becoming increasingly
necessary to ensure high performance in a rapidly changing global
society. Thus, educational approaches combining space science topics
with art could provide an effective method to inspire youth to
seek education and careers in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;-requiring fields, and to approach
them innovatively and&amp;nbsp;creatively.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In addition, the integration of science with art can provide a more
effective outreach tool for youth and adults than using science alone.
Prompting artistic expression with information about our current
knowledge of human space exploration has the potential to reach a wide
audience of youth. The resulting artwork can then be used as
a communication tool to inspire even more people of all ages, enhancing
awareness, interest, and support for human space flight. The artwork can
also provide new ideas or renewed inspiration to those already working
in the space industry. In the past, many of our science programs in
human space&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;exploration have been inspired by the works of artists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

the &lt;a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/humansinspaceart/index.shtml.en"&gt;Humans in Space Youth Art Competition&lt;/a&gt;continues to invite young
people all over the world to think about the future of human space
flight and to creatively communicate their ideas - and then promises to
share those ideas with the world. By including the next generation in
the planning of the future, the competition aims to enhance their
awareness, interest in and support for human space flight, and to allow
their ideas to begin shaping the future&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current 2012 competition encourages young people from 10 to 18 years
of age to submit visual, literary, musical and video artwork expressing
their vision of how humans will use science and technology in the future
to explore space and uncover its mysteries. Their submissions will be
judged by an international panel including artists, scientists,
teachers, engineers, astronauts and others. The winning artwork will be
woven into displays and performances designed to relay the young
artists’ messages to other young people and adults around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other thoughts on the intersection of scientists and art&amp;#8230; or
artists and&amp;nbsp;science:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science communication is not a one-way street between researchers &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
journalists to the lay public. From the Science Art Feed you can see the
array of conversations non-scientists are starting through visual media.
There’s a response, an echo and an amplification to the impact the
scientific method has had on culture. Researchers, too, are stepping in
and showing the inspiring, baffling and illuminating images they come
across and use. Does it mean there is a new aesthetic, a new movement
afoot?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[Glendon Mellow in Scientific&amp;nbsp;American ][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;art is not only close to science but it is complementary, and even
necessary. Thus the scientific eye is able to penetrate the smallest
sub-atomic particle, which moves perpetually creating energy waves and
makes one realise that the structure of matter consists of emptiness.
The artistic eye can see in that void, in that fluid &amp;#8220;emptiness&amp;#8221;, a seed
for a new vision of the world: a world no longer dominated by
materialism and its devastating consequences.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[Liz Else in New&amp;nbsp;Scientist ][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Art remains an invaluable tool not just for outreach but for how we talk
about science and exploration. Alan Alda gave this interesting lecture

communicate&amp;nbsp;differently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, John Bohannon and the Black Label Movement gave this incredibly
powerful TEDx Brussels talk called Dance your PhD, reflecting on how
sometimes dance could communicate more than science - or words - ever
could on their own. Human movement can communicate incredibly complex
ideas, expressing facets of the unknown in new and powerful&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where and how do you think art can help shape exploration? How could
art help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; continue to tell its story of pioneering the&amp;nbsp;future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

together for the &lt;a href="http://rhok.org"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness Global Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;.  Born in
2009, Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is the brainchild of a partnership
among Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the World Bank.  The RHoK
international community is over 4000 strong, encompassing not only
computer programmers but also engineers, designers, web experts, project
managers and other tech-savvy do-gooders, as well as subject matter
experts in areas as diverse as disaster risk management, climate change,
water, healthcare and human rights.  This group of unlikely
collaborators works together to define challenges facing humanity in
local communities all around the world, and then to rapidly prototype
solutions during an intensive weekend of round-the-clock&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fueled by copious amounts of coffee and a desire to make a difference in
the world, “&lt;em&gt;hackers for humanity&lt;/em&gt;” working alongside subject matter
experts have created innovative solutions to pressing problems in their
communities.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team at RHoK in Trento, Italy designed a mobile application that
    &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/81546"&gt;connects charities distributing food to needy populations&lt;/a&gt; with
    restaurants and businesses with excess food to&amp;nbsp;donate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team at RHoK Philadelphia designed a web platform enabling
    homeless service providers to easily [identify empty beds and open
    soup kitchens][] for Philadelphia and New Jersey homeless&amp;nbsp;populations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team at RHoK Washington &lt;span class="caps"&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; designed a tool to [visualize complex
    landslide risk algorithms][], making the information accessible to
    local mayors and urban planners making building&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A team at RHoK Sydney created a crowdsourcing tool to allow
    Australian citizens to &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/2555"&gt;rapidly report and respond to Bushfires&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two short years since its inception, RHoK communities have sprung
up in close to 50 cities around the world, with the support of over 180
diverse partner organizations, from government and academia, to the
non-profit and private&amp;nbsp;sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHoK Global in June 2012 will be taking place simultaneously in 21+
cities globally, from Seattle to Santo Domingo, from Philadelphia to&amp;nbsp;Prague.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be a part of this global movement to make the world a better place
through the innovative use of technology.  Register at
&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/events"&gt;www.rhok.org/events&lt;/a&gt; and come out to hack for humanity in a city near
you on June 2nd and 3rd,&amp;nbsp;2012!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>ISERVE to serve: A visit to the NASA/USAID SERVIR Coordination Office</title><link href="/iserve-to-serve-a-visit-to-the-nasausaid-servir-coordination-office" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-30T16:41:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Samantha Snabes</name></author><id>tag:,2012-04-30:iserve-to-serve-a-visit-to-the-nasausaid-servir-coordination-office</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;It seemed to be good to be true.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Last fall, my friend and OpenGov
colleague Ali Llewellyn shared with me that there was a group of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
employees and contractors supporting an initiative to connect satellite
resources to better the world. I had to know&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple Google search uncovered a webpage for the project, known as
&lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or, to serve, in Spanish. Here, I learned that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;
initiative integrates satellite observations, ground-based data and
forecast models to monitor and forecast environmental changes and to
improve response to natural disasters. This enables scientists,
educators, project managers and policy implementers to better respond to
a range of issues including disaster management, agricultural
development, biodiversity conservation and climate change. Principally
supported by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://usaid.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Agency of International Development&lt;/a&gt;, or
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, a strong emphasis is placed on partnerships to fortify the
availability of searchable and viewable earth observations,
measurements, animations, and&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Impressive, yes, but how do they do it and who are the people
involved?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This question and others I pondered as I drove to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama to see the
&lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coordination office and rapid prototyping facility&amp;nbsp;firsthand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the project director Dan Irwin, an
energetic and articulate man who has committed his career to serving his
passion for both those in need and leveraging the multitude of resources
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; generates in our quest to uncover the unknown. Over the next hour I
had the honor of meeting his diverse team as they highlighted current
projects and past accomplishments which had caught the attention and
support of not only the head of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; president and multiple
dignitaries on numerous&amp;nbsp;occasions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spanning three continents, several countries, and affecting thousands of
lives, &lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;’s&lt;/a&gt; reach is extensive and a result of
well-conceived, sustainable efforts. Their latest project, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISERV&lt;/span&gt;: The
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; / &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; Environmental Research and Visualization System promises to
be yet another win for social&amp;nbsp;good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool, scheduled to launch to the international space station on
June 26th, is dedicated to assisting social innovators and emergency
responders to accessing much needed data and imagery within 3 hours of a
web or mobile app request. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISERV&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;Pathfinder&lt;/em&gt;is the first phase in
an envisioned series of Earth observing instruments designed to leverage
the unique attributes of the International Space Station in order to
provide high quality data for science and disaster response at
relatively low&amp;nbsp;cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pathfinder&lt;/em&gt;is a telescope that is ground commanded for pointing and
image acquisition. Individual commands or command scripts are uplinked
to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISERV&lt;/span&gt; computer where they are executed at scheduled times. Data
frames are immediately stored aboard the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISERV&lt;/span&gt; computer, downlinked to
ground stations, and finally transmitted via Internet to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISERV&lt;/span&gt;
Science Operations Center at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSFC&lt;/span&gt;’s National Space Science and
Technology Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSSTC&lt;/span&gt;) who then pushes it to the requester. When
complete, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISERV&lt;/span&gt; suite could also include internal and external
optical sensors operating in the visible, near- and mid-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IR&lt;/span&gt; portions of
the electromagnetic&amp;nbsp;spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="worf" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/worf-300x297.png" title="worf" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This effort was accomplished by a dynamic team of less than 20
individuals that comprise the Coordination Office, many of whom have
personally founded nonprofits and spent time living and working in the
regions they serve. Their offices are strategically located outside of
the Marshall campus, thus allowing the group to receive employees,
intern and volunteer support from individuals around the world who can
offer relevant local&amp;nbsp;perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two &lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project regional operational facilities support the
Coordination Office in 1) Nairobi, Kenya, at the Regional Center for
Mapping of Resources for Development (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCMRD&lt;/span&gt;) and 2) Kathmandu, Nepal, at
the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. A third
hub, located at the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America
and the Caribbean (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CATHALAC&lt;/span&gt;) in Panama City, Panama, recently
“graduated” from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; system and is providing information on its
own. Each &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; facility is housed in an existing organization with a
regional mandate, and the project is primarily staffed and operated by
people from that region. Together, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; facilities form a broader
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; network with exchange of data, knowledge, and experience among
the centers that transcends geographic and organizational&amp;nbsp;boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Connect with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; boasts multiple successes, the group seeks to expand.
Building and relying upon a network of collaborators is fundamental to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;. Beyond the sponsorship and active participation of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, collaboration spans a number of other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; government agencies and
projects, as well as partnerships with government agencies in the
regions in which &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; operates joint research with universities and
non-governmental organizations, and capacity building with a host of
specialized groups. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt; puts special emphasis on working with
national space agencies to improve the discovery and use of available
imagery. Collaboration also includes interaction with institutions that
play important roles in relevant global research and operational
activities (e.g., &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPIDER&lt;/span&gt;, International Charter, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIESIN&lt;/span&gt;, and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRI&lt;/span&gt;). Operational and implementation partnerships, too, are critical and
have been established with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s regional centers (e.g., &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RCMRD&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ICIMOD&lt;/span&gt;) to deliver products and services and improve outreach to
different thematic&amp;nbsp;communities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, &lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plans to augment data sets, collaborations,
and opportunities receive requests and observations. We invite you to
learn more about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;, including opportunities to see the lab in
action, request information, download data, collaborate, or to intern as
a student researcher at: &lt;a href="http://servirglobal.net/"&gt;http://www.servirglobal.net/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; successfully fulfilled a commitment on behalf of the
United States as part of the &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"&gt;Open Government Partnership&lt;/a&gt; Domestic
Action Plan.  The stated goal of the event, per the &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/sites/www.opengovpartnership.org/files/country_action_plans/US_National_Action_Plan_Final_2.pdf"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; Action Plan&lt;/a&gt;,
was to &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;promote innovation through international collaboration&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. Space
exploration was the ideal catalyst to foster this culture of innovation,
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, in collaboration with &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/partners/"&gt;8 government agencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/partners/"&gt;103 other
organizations&lt;/a&gt;, hosted the International Space
Apps Challenge in &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/locations/"&gt;25 cities&lt;/a&gt; in 17 countries on all seven continents
and online.  The event held 21-22 April 2012 brought together 2,083
registered participants (ages 16-70) together to address &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;71
challenges&lt;/a&gt;.  More than &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/solutions/"&gt;100 unique solutions&lt;/a&gt; were developed in
less then 48 hours during the event.  All solutions were developed in a
completely open source environment, and each have their own unique
potential to go even further to address world and space technology&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the technology developed, the event itself generated
considerable media coverage for the agency, resulting in &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/press/"&gt;72 English
articles&lt;/a&gt;, including landing on the front of the &lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17791091"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BBC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; website on 21
April 2012.  &lt;a href="http://gov20radio.com/spaceapps/"&gt;Gov2.0Radio&lt;/a&gt; provided special coverage for the event
which included 45 interviews with organizers, experts and participants
from all locations.  The entire event was streamed online to thousands
of people around the world, and although hard to measure the total
viewership, the twitter stream alone generated 3.3M&amp;nbsp;impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have compiled a small cross-section of 11 examples, that represent
the quality of the technology developed. Over the next few days, we will
be featuring the top 50 &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/solutions/"&gt;solutions&lt;/a&gt; on this
website and &lt;a href="http://innovationendeavors.com/"&gt;Innovation Endeavours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creative"&gt;Talenthouse&lt;/a&gt; will start the

agriculture&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HazardMap&lt;/strong&gt; - A real-time hazard map application that is powered by
social media observations to help provide a a useful risk assessment
for potential (and actual) crisis&amp;nbsp;situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commonality of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Datasets&lt;/strong&gt; - A data schema attempts to capture
the commonalities between datasets acquired by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to allow citizen
scientists and data mining softwares to quickly locate relevant
datasets required to answer questions posed in broad terms, such as
&amp;#8220;Has the sea level risen in the last 10&amp;nbsp;years?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aeration &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Low Temperature Baking&lt;/strong&gt; - An energy efficient, self
sufficient process to produce ordinary, fresh bread with minimal
ingredients at lower, safer temperatures in a limited resource&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Wind Visualization&lt;/strong&gt; - A desktop client that takes solar wind
speed live from the web and produces an animation of the current wind
speeds. The same feed is also used by an Arduino to show the live
intensity of the solar winds by lighting more lights the more intense
the&amp;nbsp;winds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; - A preliminary design and schema for a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Open Data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; to improve accessibility and a unified interface to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
datasets without requiring specialist&amp;nbsp;knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Open Hardware Design&lt;/strong&gt; - An open hardware design that visualizes
the location of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; in space.  The distance is calculated and if
closer than 15,000km (ground projection) lights are turned on using an
Arduino. The closer the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; the more lights that are lit topping out
at 10 lights when within&amp;nbsp;0.5km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A View from Space&lt;/strong&gt; - An app that restricts a shared social media
stream based on the orbit of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; in order to provide a common
viewpoint and build a community around space data based on&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;

for decades, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has been dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of one
of the most complex objects in the universe &amp;#8212; planet Earth. Because of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s commitment to Earth science, we have developed an understanding
of our home planet that is unmatched in human history. But there is
still so much more to learn. Scores of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; satellites are expanding our
knowledge and in the process helping save lives through improved
response to natural disasters, and helping us better cope with
environmental, health, and energy challenges that know no&amp;nbsp;borders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In recent years &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has also taken steps to minimize our footprint on
the planet by constructing green buildings and investing in green
aviation research to inspire the development of more fuel-efficient
aircraft and spark the start of a new electric airplane&amp;nbsp;industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the spirit of stewardship exemplified by our agency, I encourage you
to participate in Earth Day educational events, programs, and activities
planned at your center or in your local community. Whether you decide to
walk to work, volunteer for a local community clean-up, or talk to
students about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Earth science or green aviation research, let us
celebrate this planet we call home on Earth Day and all year&amp;nbsp;long. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s no accident that we are holding the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt; on the same weekend as &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/earthday/"&gt;Earth Day&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s vision
to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and
learn will benefit all humankind has as much impact for how we live on
Earth as for how we will explore beyond the&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can you make a&amp;nbsp;difference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have an idea for a cool app to celebrate Earth Day? The only limit

    Earth from space without being moved in some way. One of the main
    goals of Fragile Oasis is to share this orbital perspective and
    inspire people to go out and make a difference; to go out and
    somehow make life better for those with whom they share this fragile
    oasis. The Fragile Oasis community was established to unite in the
    common goal of sharing our humanity and improving our world. Let us
    inspire, recognize, and help each other in our collective quest to

*If somebody&amp;#8217;d said before the flight, &amp;#8220;Are you going to get carried
away looking at the earth from the moon?&amp;#8221; I would have say, &amp;#8220;No, no
way.&amp;#8221; But yet when I first looked back at the earth, standing on the
moon, I cried.*

*The world itself looks cleaner and so much more beautiful. Maybe we can
make it that way—the way God intended it to be—by giving everybody that
new perspective from out in space.*

talents and perspectives to imagine and implement new solutions and&amp;nbsp;ventures.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparation for the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was
invited to lead a Salon at &lt;a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt; as part of the
&lt;a href="http://curbcreativecampus.org/curb-scholars/program-overview/"&gt;Curb Creative Enterprise and Public Leadership Scholars Program&lt;/a&gt;. The
Curb Center Leadership Salons provide some of Vanderbilt&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://curbcreativecampus.org/curb-scholars/students/"&gt;brightest
students&lt;/a&gt; the chance to engage in informal conversations and hands-on
workshops with leaders from across the creative spectrum. Some of their
&lt;a href="http://curbcreativecampus.org/curb-scholars/scholar-events-and-sessions/"&gt;previous guests&lt;/a&gt; include the co-creators of Guitar Hero and Rock
Band, to fashion designers and entrepreneurs. Given that the
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most creative
undertakings the Agency has ever attempted, the invitation seemed&amp;nbsp;appropriate!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Initiative&lt;/a&gt; in general, and the
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, are activities
that value creativity and require &amp;#8220;outside-the-box&amp;#8221; thinking.  The idea
of a Salon incentives students to apply the use of a creative process in
order to develop innovation solutions to tough challenges. The approach
is much more engaging then a lecture about a topic and challenges the
students to develop creative solutions to real problems facing real
organizations.  The Curb Center is all about understanding and applying
the creative process. Through creative practice workshops, the Curb
Scholars experiment and gain experience in the creative process and
problem solving—brainstorming, improvising, storytelling, asking
provocative questions, synthesizing ideas, using humor, recombining
materials and ideas, diagnosing problems, prototyping, and pitching
their&amp;nbsp;innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blackboard.jpg" title="blackboard" /&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/blackboard.jpg" title="blackboard" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As predicted, the process &lt;em&gt;works&lt;/em&gt;.  When presented with a sub-set of the
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;60 challenges&lt;/a&gt; posted on the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps
Challenge&lt;/a&gt;website, the students came up with some very impressive
solutions. The ideas and feedback generated by the students in just a
matter of hours were so good that we used them to refine and improve the
challenges for the event. To give you an example of what the solutions
looked like, one team took the approach to develop a challenge by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
for schools across the nation to &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/visualize-all-too-common-astronomysolar-system-mis/"&gt;Visualize the All-too-Common
Astronomy/Solar System Misconceptions&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t you like to party it up with an astronaut at your school?!?
Visit &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s “How Well do You Know our Solar System?” page to enter
your school in our national competition. We have listed dozens of
misconceptions that exist about our universe and we would like you to
solve them. Help educate others with a 1 minute music video/jingle
that spreads the truth about the solar system! Next, upload your
videos onto our page. You will compete with hundreds of other classes
around the world for a chance to meet an astronaut. The class with the
best jingle will be rewarded with an all day visit from a real
astronaut! If your video is chosen, it will also be featured on&amp;nbsp;television!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not interested in creating a video but still want to be involved?
Purchase your own space buddy that have been modeled after actual
astronauts! Each stuffed doll comes with a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; that allows you to
access your own universe. You will be able to play interactive games
and build your own world! See what happens if the Earth does get
bigger than the Sun! If the Sun did disappear at night! Each item
purchased will provide funds for an impoverished child to learn more
about the solar system by providing them with a scholarship to attend
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; space&amp;nbsp;camp!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So why does creativity&amp;nbsp;matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an &lt;a href="http://www.vanderbilt.edu/curbcenter/2011/09/steven-tepper-and-george-d-kuh-lets-get-serious-about-cultivating-creativity-the-chronicle-review/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; posted on the Curb Center&amp;#8217;s website by &lt;a href="http://curbcreativecampus.org/people/"&gt;Steven
Tepper&lt;/a&gt;and George D. Kuh called “&lt;em&gt;Let’s Get Serious About Cultivating
Creativity&lt;/em&gt;,” the authors explains that &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;To fuel the 21st-century
economic engine and sustain democratic values, we must unleash and
nurture the creative impulse that exists within every one of us, or so
say experts like Richard Florida, Ken Robinson, Daniel Pink, Keith
Sawyer, and Tom Friedman. Indeed, just as the advantages the United
States enjoyed in the past were based in large part on scientific and
engineering advances, today it is cognitive flexibility, inventiveness,
design thinking, and nonroutine approaches to messy problems that are
essential to adapt to rapidly changing and unpredictable global forces;
to create new markets; to take risks and start new enterprises; and to
produce compelling forms of media, entertainment, and design.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we get ready for the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; and start
to think about the solutions we plan to develop around one of the many
challenges this weekend, I really encourage you to consider your
creative approach. Are you thinking about the problem in a traditional
way or are you really stretching yourself creatively? What are
the decisions, practices, regulations, and laws that you are letting
nurture or constrain your creative&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Please&lt;/span&gt; use this event
as an opportunity to experiment - &lt;em&gt;to learn&lt;/em&gt; - to try something
different. Being creative may feel like a risk, but it&amp;#8217;s one that is
well worth it.  You may be surprised with the&amp;nbsp;results!&lt;/p&gt;

the International Space Apps Challenge planning team to host a pre-event
for the Challenge that will take place this weekend; a Flight Readiness
Review for the challenges that will be worked at the event itself. The
evening kicked off with a short overview presentation of the Challenge
and some background from experience with Random Hacks of Kindness. What
we know from RHoK is that these events can be incredibly successful, but
often there are questions and stumbling blocks that could be avoided if
the challenges were simply assessed a little more ahead of time – this
was the motivation for this pre-event with the Yahoo Developer Network.
We wanted to ask the right questions ahead of time so that when the
“mission” itself occurs we have all of the tools and information
available and ready so that the challenges can be worked in an efficient
and successful&amp;nbsp;manner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants included representatives from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, representatives that
will be supporting the event in San Francisco, people from organizations
that have an interest in the results from the challenges, people who
submitted challenges, and many skilled and talented Yahoo developers.
After our short presentations, we turned challenges over, for the first
time, to software developers who could begin brainstorming to provide
input for the challenges. All that was provided were some basic
guideline questions such&amp;nbsp;as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="margin-left: 30px"&gt;

-   Can this challenge be solved in a weekend and if not what pieces of
    it can be solved in a week?
-   Has this been solved before and, if so, is there another piece of
    development that needs to be done to expand upon it?
-   What datasets are needed still?

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People formed teams and worked on approximately ten challenges each –
brainstorming and asking key questions. The results were exciting!
Developers were excited to see what challenges had been proposed. They
assessed underlying questions, provided information where they found
challenges that already had full or partial solutions, and assessed
challenges that should be worked together rather than as independent
challenges. They captured their thoughts on the comment fields for the
challenges or on the Etherpad links provided with some of the&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This event confirmed our belief that we have some very compelling
challenges. I was impressed by how quickly the teams were engrossed in
the challenges that were proposed. At one point, pizza was delivered to
the room full of developers who had not yet had dinner, and no one moved
– everyone kept brainstorming and discussing the challenges despite the
wafting smell of bread and cheese. This seemed rather notable given the
crowd in&amp;nbsp;attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was and am incredibly encouraged by the pre-event and think that this
could be a great thing for all future apps development challenges. Just
like any other mission, we want to do as much work as we can ahead of
time to make the mission itself successful. Thanks to the Yahoo
Developer Network for all of their support and for hosting the event
that we think is going to help making the International Space Apps
Challenge an even larger&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To everyone reading this, we encourage you to do something similar -
start discussing the challenges and asking some of those guiding
questions above. Visit the challenges at
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges"&gt;http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges&lt;/a&gt; and share your thoughts and
concerns now so that on the weekend of the event we can move forward
even more quickly. I’m so encouraged by the challenges that have been
submitted the conversation that those challenges inspired and the people
that they’ve brought together. I can’t wait to see what solutions will
come forward on April 21st and&amp;nbsp;22nd!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="challenges"></category><category term="NASA"></category><category term="spaceapps"></category><category term="yahoo"></category></entry><entry><title>Media Coverage of the International Space Apps Challenge</title><link href="/media-coverage-of-the-international-space-apps-challenge" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-04-17T14:58:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2012-04-17:media-coverage-of-the-international-space-apps-challenge</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In 3 days, nearly &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;1,800 people&lt;/a&gt;(and counting) from around the world

Earth, and then returned 108 minutes later with the perspective nearly
all of us privileged to follow him would come to&amp;nbsp;understand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Orbiting Earth in the spaceship, I saw how beautiful our planet is.
People, let us preserve and increase this beauty, not destroy&amp;nbsp;it!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty years later, when I left Earth from the same launchpad as Yuri
Gagarin, I took with me another long held view of astronauts and
cosmonauts: you can’t see borders from space. It was during my five and
one-half month mission that I discovered that I was wrong. You can see
human-made borders from&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the orbital perspective of living and working in space
shows us just how interconnected we are. We are all in this together.
The orbital perspective, first sensed by Yuri Gagarin fifty-one years
ago, is the realization that the only way we can solve the problems
facing our planet is by working&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 21st and 22nd, citizens of Earth will pool their brainpower and
their passion for problem solving in a 48 hour technology development
marathon taking place on all seven continents – and in space. &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;The
International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;is the epicenter for the kind of
collaboration that gives birth to innovation, and clarity to issues
facing our planet and its&amp;nbsp;inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; draws
a straight line from what confronts humans who live in space to what
confronts us here on Spaceship Earth. Think about it: we have no natural
resources in the hostile environment of space. This forces us to
generate, collect, store, conserve, recycle, and manage our resources
wisely - just like we must on Earth. After all, the life support systems
that sustain astronauts onboard the International Space Station are not
really different than those that sustain humans on Earth: water, air,
food, environment; even community, communication and&amp;nbsp;peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is working with organizations around the world on the International
Space Apps Challenge as part of the United States commitment to the Open
Government Partnership. As of today, 1,300 concerned citizens of Earth,
discipline experts, engineers, scientists, and software code developers
will collaborate at 25 physical locations worldwide to build software,
open hardware, data visualization, and citizen science platform
solutions from publicly available data that address strategic
exploration and social needs. All challenges are listed on the
International Space Apps website, including &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/fragile-oasis-map-difference/"&gt;one submitted by Fragile
Oasis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the innovations that can come from the International Space Apps
Challenge, I believe the most important of all is the collaboration
itself. A global community coming together to tackle challenges facing
our planet demonstrates the power of collaboration across borders,
cultures and&amp;nbsp;continents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I look forward to meeting everyone at the San Francisco location, and
interacting online with others all over the globe. Please join&amp;nbsp;us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition among nations thrust one human into space fifty-one years
ago today. International cooperation keeps us there, and is the key to
taking us far beyond what we can see with just our&amp;nbsp;eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key principles of Open Government – participation, collaboration
and transparency - have been embedded in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; operations for more than
50 years. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; continues to implement the Open Government
Directive, we have developed version 2.0 of our Open Government Plan
to serve as a model – not a manual – for what a more open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; might
look like today. Our Plan collects the many new activities that
exemplify the evolution of openness in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s policy, technology and
culture – and provides citizens the opportunity to respond and&amp;nbsp;engage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Infographic-Icon-134x300.png" title="Infographic Icon" /&gt;][]Two years ago this April, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; released version 1.0 of its Open
Government Plan. The Plan set forth a bold and aggressive vision for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The Plan included 3 flagship initiatives and 147 goals across
twenty-organizations. For the past two years, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has been hard at work
implementing the Plan. We&amp;#8217;ve captured the highlights in an updated
[infographic][&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Infographic-Icon-134x300.png" title="Infographic Icon" /&gt;] and are very proud of all that the Agency has
accomplished in such a short amount of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to release &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;version 2.0&lt;/a&gt; of our Plan &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;. We used
this milestone to sharpen our focus and commitment to Open Government.
We see Open Government as the responsibility of every person who works
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and we take seriously the principles of &lt;em&gt;participation&lt;/em&gt;,
&lt;em&gt;collaboration&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; in all that we&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;Version 2.0 of our Open Government Plan&lt;/a&gt; is meant to serve
as a model – not a manual – for what an open government might look like.
The Plan includes a new &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/nasa-web-environment/"&gt;Flagship Initiative&lt;/a&gt; that will take a fresh
look at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; web architecture and processes to manage content in
order build an accessible, participatory and transparent web environment
based on open and interoperable standards. We will also push forward our
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-data/"&gt;Open Data&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-source-software/"&gt;Open Source&lt;/a&gt;efforts, as well as add a new category
called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/technology-accelerators/"&gt;Technology Accelerators&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; that takes a look at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
commitment to technology development and&amp;nbsp;innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Cover-Icon1.jpg" title="Cover-Icon" /&gt;][]We recognize that as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; continues to implement the Open
Government Directive, and as the values of Open Government are further
embedded into our core mission, new activities and anecdotal successes
that embody values of transparency, participation, and collaboration
will be developed. In fact, Open Government principles are already
evident in numerous activities underway throughout the Agency. One of
the most exciting additions to the Plan with version 2.0 is a new open
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/directory/"&gt;directory&lt;/a&gt; that aims to capture these activities in one place for the
benefit of all. The goal of the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/directory/"&gt;directory&lt;/a&gt; is to communicate the many
opportunities &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has to actively involve individuals as contributors
to and collaborators with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s research, science, and exploration
activities. At the time of publication, the directory is populated with
over &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/category/activity/"&gt;100 participatory, collaborative and transparent activities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 2.0 of our Plan represents the next generation of Open
Government at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. It is our hope that the new &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government
Plan will not only provide a strong multi-dimensional &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/framework/"&gt;framework&lt;/a&gt; of
technology, policy, and culture, but will create new opportunities for
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; to participate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s mission to &lt;em&gt;pioneer the future&lt;/em&gt;. We
encourage you to visit the new online version of the plan by visiting
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"&gt;http://open.nasa.gov/plan&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking for a good place to
start, check out the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/graphical-summary/"&gt;Graphical Summary&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, a few words of acknowledgment. There are so many people around
the agency who have worked very hard to make Version 2.0 of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Open
Government Plan a possibility. Open Government is definitely a team
sport at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and without the contributions of so many, releasing
something like this would be simply impossible (especially in a
government agency). Thank you to all of you who contributed to the
second version of the Plan, including - Roopangi Kadakia, Adrian
Gardner, Myra Bambacus, Beth Beck, Stephanie Stockman, Jeff Hayes,
Jennifer Gustetic, Jeff Davis, Cindy Rando, Jason Crusan, Miriam
Brown-Lam, Mabel Matthews, Fatima Senghore, Jasper Wolfe, David Mayer,
Lynn Heimerl, Scott Goodwin, Susan Minor, Sasi Pillay, and Allison
Wolff. The plan represents some of the most innovative and visionary
things the Agency is doing. Thank you to our leadership - Deborah Diaz,
Sasi Pillay, Linda Cureton, Nadine Tremper, Beth &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/graphical-summary/"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Visual-Icon-219x300.jpg" title="Visual-Icon" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Robinson, and Mark Hill - for your unending&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might be biased, but a special thanks goes to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government
Team who has worked effortlessly to develop this plan.  There is no way
to account for all the all nighters you have pulled, the weekends you
have worked, the classes you have missed or the emails you have answered
even while you pretended to be on vacation. You truly deserve a special
acknowledgement for your work - which most of the time - happens behind
the scenes. Thank you &lt;span
style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/adllewellyn/"&gt;Ali
Llewellyn&lt;/a&gt;, for your leadership, patience and endless passion for all
that we do.  Without Ali, this plan would never be. Thank you &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/sherron/"&gt;Sean
Herron&lt;/a&gt;, for your determination to make every open government website
the best, most secure, modern and accessible website, ever imaginable.
Thank you Samantha Snabes for helping us with the finer details of the
directory. Thank you &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/drbonill/"&gt;Dennis Bonilla&lt;/a&gt;, Tate Srey, and Kate Jeremeko
for the amazing artwork. And thank you &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/cgerty/"&gt;Chris Gerty&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/weshagh/"&gt;William
Eshagh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/kpaintin/"&gt;Kristen Painting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://fragileoasis.org/bloggernauts/Astro_Ron/"&gt;Ron Garan&lt;/a&gt; for continuing to
juggle everything else do in Open Government the past few weeks. The
development of this plan is truly a testament to what a small,
committed, talented and passionate team can do&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;

there are so many locations signed up for this event that our
homepage &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; is getting cluttered!  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, so I admit that this is not
a bad problem to have at all.  In fact, we’re incredibly excited about
how much this event has grown since the original &lt;a href="http://goo.gl/GGVXb"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; of
the Apps Challenge on March 9, 2012.  What we can’t demonstrate very
well on our map is all of our virtual participants, so that’s what I
want to write about here&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for participating in the International Space Apps Challenge
from your personal location!  We are excited about the collaboration of
individuals around the world on this event; you are making the Apps
Challenge community even more unique and even more spread out across
borders.  Make sure when you start working on the weekend of the Apps
Challenge to check back in to the Virtual Participation page to kick off
your experience with our personal welcome message going to all
participants in every&amp;nbsp;location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a virtual participant we want you to be involved just as if you were
at any other location.  Seek out teams of other virtual participants,
seek out teams at physical locations, make your own team, work on your
own - whatever works best for you!  Here are some thoughts to get you
started on however you want to connect and create amazing solutions to
the&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How You Can Organize&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Ahead of Time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Create teams to work together on challenges.  You can find information
on who is planning to work on challenges just by checking out the
challenge page.  Anyone who follows the challenge will have their avatar
on the page.  See someone who you think you’d work well with?  Use the
Etherpad (connected with each challenge) to indicate your skills and
willingness to help remotely, and use the Pad’s chat feature to send
messages to others and start&amp;nbsp;collaborating!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;During&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During the challenge continue to use the Pad or your favorite chat
client to connect to anyone with whom you’ve joined forces.  Yep, it’s
that easy.  If you have a better way to connect that you think others
would be interested in just leave a note on this page’s Pad.  Check back
there frequently to keep in touch with other virtual participants and
the organizing team on logistics of being a virtual&amp;nbsp;participant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How You Can Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We’re hoping you will find each set of Pad notes and Pad chats useful
for both the challenges and for your location.  There are still other
ways to connect as well.  Watch all of the video streams from the global
locations on our UStream Superchannel for the event.  Watch our twitter
feed &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/intlspaceapps"&gt;@intlspaceapps&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(#spaceapps).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How You Produce and Submit Your Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want you to think of yourself as just another participant at any
other location - so we have it set up that your solutions will end up in
the same location as theirs.  If you are working virtually just fill in
your “location” for judging as “virtual”.  We are working hard to get a
panel to judge all virtual submissions.  If you worked with a team that
had people in one of the locations just choose where you want the
solution to be judged and have the person in that location post the
solution for your whole&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you all again for supporting the International Space Apps
Challenge from your location!  We may not have your city marked on our
map but we are so excited that you are participating and bringing
forward all of your&amp;nbsp;skills.&lt;/p&gt;

Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; – our global codeathon taking place on all seven
continents and in space next month. Last month, we launched a new
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; for the Challenge that
allows visitors to sign up for events, view and submit challenges, and
learn more about the event. We put a lot of effort in to making it
cutting edge by using the latest web technologies and standards to
provide an excellent user experience. This post will showcase just some
of the methods we used to make the site, and give you some ideas for
creating one&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-23-at-2.09.24-AM-300x241.png" title="Screen shot 2012-03-23 at 2.09.24 AM" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges in creating the site was that, due to our
global audience, we had to ensure the site is compatible and accessible
across a wide range of devices, screen sizes, and internet speeds. The
site is fully responsive, meaning that by using some &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;
trickery, we’re able to serve up different designs depending on the
user’s screen size. Try it now – visit
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;spaceappschallenge.org&lt;/a&gt; on a
smartphone and a desktop at the same time. You’ll see two different
designs, even though each uses the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsive design is becoming increasingly important on the web as more
and more users access websites using smartphones, tablets, and other
small devices. By optimizing the site to a range of user experiences, we
don’t lock people in to viewing a design best suited for a desktop&amp;nbsp;monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site also makes much use of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML5&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS3&lt;/span&gt; standards. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS3&lt;/span&gt;
allows us to duplicate a lot of the design features that previously
required images, meaning that pages load faster and our design is more
flexible. The framework of the site is built off of a combination of the
&lt;a href="http://getskelton.com"&gt;Skelton&lt;/a&gt; flexible grid system, with some design elements taken from
&lt;a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"&gt;Twitter Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;. We also make use of &lt;a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/"&gt;Font Awesome&lt;/a&gt;, which
allows us to use a webfont for icons rather than images. By using these
forward-leaning practices, we can considerably cut down on file sizes
and offer a faster and more accessible experience to&amp;nbsp;visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accessibility for us also meant making the site available in as many
different ways as possible. For instance, much of our content is encoded
in &lt;a href="http://microformats.org/"&gt;Microformats&lt;/a&gt;, which extends our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt; in a semantic way to be
understandable by machines. Additionally, we&amp;#8217;re working with our
location partners to offer translations of content where appropriate.
The Tokyo location, for instance, offers a &lt;a href="http://tokyo.spaceappschallenge.org"&gt;Japanese translation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Backend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from our design philosophy, we also strived to create a backend
system that enables flexibility, stability, and performance. The site is
hosted on a cloud platform running Linux and powered by &lt;a href="http://nginx.org/"&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"&gt;Postgres&lt;/a&gt;. While our sites have traditionally run on &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org"&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;,
we decided to go with a Django-based platform. This is due to some of
the particular needs of the site, such as event registration and project
collaboration. We utilize extensive server-side caching to improve
performance and automatically compress and minify our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt;, and
Javascript. On the design side, our templates were styled using &lt;a href="http://lesscss.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LESS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
and we used the helpLESS library to help us do some common tasks more&amp;nbsp;effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Design&amp;nbsp;Philosophy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the technologies and methodologies I have written about are
the things that the end-user is least likely to care about. On the web,
design is paramount. We wanted the Apps Challenge site to be visually
striking and immediately impart a sense of global collaboration to the
visitor. We spent a lot of effort on creating the main design element on
the front page - the map of the world with tags for every location where
the Space Apps Challenge is taking place. Now, doing this with a map of
the Earth is pretty easy (which is lucky, because we&amp;#8217;ve been adding
locations left and right recently!). The difficult part is showing the
highest and fastest-moving location: the International Space Station. We
first experimented with just showing a static icon of the station over
the pacific ocean. Pretty boring. We decided it had to be animated and
move across the screen. Here&amp;#8217;s a little secret, however: the station
does not actually show up where it really is on the planet. We
experimented with making the image live-update as the station crossed
over the globe, but ultimately decided not to for a few&amp;nbsp;reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​1) The code required to do so would be much heavier than we were
willing to put on the site.&lt;br /&gt;
2) The projection of the map on the homepage is slightly different than
the projections of most orbital tracks posted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, meaning that we
would have had to translate coordinates to our projection.&lt;br /&gt;
3) The station would have moved realllllly slowly on the screen. Most
users probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t have even noticed&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, we made a small sacrifice - instead, the station follows an
orbital-like wave across the map using jQuery animation and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path"&gt;path
plugin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the homepage, we focused on making the site lightweight but
incorporating design elements that reinforce that feeling of global
collaboration - Google Maps integration, for&amp;nbsp;instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this post has given you at least a glimpse into our web
philosophy and the direction in which we see taking our other properties
(&lt;a href="open.nasa.gov"&gt;open.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="data.nasa.gov"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="code.nasa.gov"&gt;code.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;) in the
future. We see the recent trend of accessible &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; responsive design as
critical to the next generation of web experiences. Our goal is to make
our content as open, accessible, and flexible as possible. We are open
to feedback and ideas about how we can further this even more - please
leave a comment and let us know what you think! Finally, none of what
we&amp;#8217;ve accomplished on the site would have been possible without the help
of everyone on the Space Apps Challenge team, including Kristen
Painting, Ali Llewellyn, Nick Skytland, Elizabeth Sabet, Chris Gerty,
and William Eshagh. William was core in creating the backend of the site
to go along with the frontend I developed - without him, we&amp;#8217;d have no
django, no server, and no&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a participant of the first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; forum, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Water,&lt;/em&gt; and someone
who recently returned from six months experiencing the orbital
perspective of our planet from 240 miles above the Earth, I invite
innovators from around the world to participate in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Beyond
Waste&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;, a social entrepreneurship forum, is in its third year of
existence,and is taking public/private partnerships to new
heights—literally and figuratively. A partnership among &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.
&lt;/span&gt;Agency for International Development, the State Department, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIKE&lt;/span&gt;, it
has become a testbed for collaboration across non-traditional
disciplines and organizations, bringing innovative solutions to
difficult sustainability challenges around and above the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; draws parallels between resource challenges humans
face onboard the International Space Station and those on Earth. Think
about it: we have no natural resources in the hostile environment of
space, which forces us to generate, collect, store, conserve, recycle,
and manage our resources wisely — just like we must on Earth. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
offers &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s problem-solving expertise to crucial conversations on
sustainability-related topics with innovative problem solvers from
around the world. It enables &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to promote emerging, transformative
technology to sustain and enrich the quality of life on Earth. After
all, the engineering approaches needed to solve many of the development
challenges facing our planet have a lot in common with those needed to
overcome the challenges of long-duration human missions beyond low-Earth&amp;nbsp;orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve specifically selected the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; challenges to tell the space
station sustainability story: the life support systems that sustain our
astronauts aboard the station are the same as those that support
inhabitants of the amazing spacecraft we are all riding on together
through the universe: Earth. Previous &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; forums investigated
challenges to our planet relating to Water, Energy, and&amp;nbsp;Health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Beyond Waste &lt;/em&gt;seeks ten game-changing innovations with the
potential to transform current waste management systems and practices.
This issue not only threatens our natural resources on Earth but also
affects how we design spacecraft and missions to transport humans beyond
Earth’s atmosphere. In fact, 40% of packaging for supplies we send up to
the crew living onboard the space station is discarded as waste. We need
to figure out a better way to use this material as feedstock, rather
than excess. We need to design closed-loop systems with a goal of zero
waste for long-duration space&amp;nbsp;missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Beyond Waste&lt;/em&gt; challenge will accept proposals from &lt;strong&gt;April
1 to May 15, 2012&lt;/strong&gt;. Ten &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; innovators will be selected to present
technology solutions at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; forum and receive networking and
mentoring opportunities from influential business and government
leaders. Following the forum, each innovator receives individualized
support in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; Accelerator phase, led by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, to help apply
recommendations from the&amp;nbsp;forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous forums have demonstrated intriguing solutions that may find
their way to space. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Water&lt;/em&gt;innovator Mark Tonkin of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DTI&lt;/span&gt;-r
developed an irrigation system that uses brackish, saline, and polluted
water in irrigated agriculture. He’s growing trees in the Jordanian
desert and conducting large-scale field trials in the United Arab
Emirates, the U.K., and the United States We’re looking at an
experimental deployment of his technology to recycle water onboard the
space station. Tonkin credits &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Water &lt;/em&gt;with driving him to
overhaul his business model and focus on research and development and
licensing&amp;nbsp;opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; success, innovators should submit &lt;em&gt;Beyond
Waste&lt;/em&gt; challenge proposals on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
website. &lt;a href="http://links.launch.org/beyond-waste"&gt;http://links.launch.org/beyond-waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m really looking forward to meeting everyone at the forum. We are all
in this together, and the only way we will overcome the challenges
facing our planet is together. The clock is ticking for a better&amp;nbsp;tomorrow!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

share here about her insights into the intersection between social
entrepreneurship and human space exploration in a continual series. You
can reach Samantha &lt;a href="http://about.me/samanthasnabes"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or follow her on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/samanthasnabes"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innovation…Impact&amp;#8230;Entrepreneurship…these are a few of the words that
often accompany the word social within the growing movement focused on
charging humanity with making a difference and enabling change. And
while exclusive language and players have emerged to rally much needed 
groups and resources, myself and others would argue that the effort is
not new, rather inherently part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; of many organizations and
agencies…including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;So what is&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When pressed to provide a definition, I have championed the&amp;nbsp;below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social entrepreneurship involves&lt;strong&gt;creating sustainable&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;large
scale&lt;/strong&gt; change to benefit humans living in space and on Earth by
applying innovative solutions using entrepreneurship principles to
address the most pressing social and environmental&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ok, so what does this&amp;nbsp;mean?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evidenced above, defining a meta-topic such as social
entrepreneurship is an arduous task.  Tactically, this could involve
designing a simple water quality monitoring system to be used by
astronauts on the International Space Station while providing satellite
data to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt;’s in Honduras attempting to identify the best location to
implement a gravity-fed resource to support locals lacking clean water.
After having the pleasure of participating in several conversations with
others active in the social good movement, I have come to appreciate
social entrepreneurship as a mindset. Social Entrepreneurship thus
provides a call to action for individuals and institutions to come
together to effect change and solve challenges relating to basic human
needs.  This includes providing microloans to overcome poverty, opening
datasets, designing mobile applications, or inventing instruments to
travel in a backpack under extreme conditions, on Earth or in Space. 
The possibilities are endless, limited only by our own creativity and
demand cross disciplinary solutions that bridge geographic and
atmospheric&amp;nbsp;boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While complexity is often associated with human space exploration, life
in space has many striking similarities to the simple challenges and
isolated environments experienced by many living in developing countries
or in remote areas. For example, to support human survival, space
travels requires mitigating issues related to accessing clean water,
emergency response, disease control, food scarcity and waste disposal.
This must be accomplished in a hostile, time-constrained environment
demanding lightweight, portable solutions requiring little power and
technical&amp;nbsp;training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcoming these physical challenges is not limited to hardware
developments and often simply requires access to information. 
Technology advances over the last 50 years have now opened up new
possibilities to extrapolate solutions from data provided by orbiting
satellites to support emergency response, crisis mapping, environmental
monitoring, and disaster prediction on Earth.  Conversely, organizations
in remote areas such as Antarctica have the potential to offer space
partners information on human behavior within extreme conditions and
lessons learned in medical&amp;nbsp;telemetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do I get&amp;nbsp;involved?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several initiatives currently facilitate social entrepreneurial efforts
within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="fragileoasis.org"&gt;Fragile&amp;nbsp;Oasis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A virtual forum supported by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to use the unique orbital
    perspective to inspire people to improve life on earth, to get the
    word out that the International Space Station is an incredible
    global asset, to highlight the scientific advancements being
    accomplished on the International Space Station, and to inspire
    students to academic&amp;nbsp;excellence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/strong&gt; ][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstrating its commitment to the Open Government Partnership,
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is working with space agencies around the world to coordinate
    an International Space Apps Challenge to be held in 2012 that will
    encourage scientists and concerned citizens from all seven
    continents – and in space – to create, build, and invent new
    solutions in order to address challenges of global&amp;nbsp;importance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="www.rhok.org"&gt;Random Hacks of&amp;nbsp;Kindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;RHoK was founded in 2009 in partnership between Google, Microsoft,
    Yahoo!, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the World Bank as a community of innovation focused
    on developing practical open source solutions to disaster risk
    management and climate change adaptation challenges. The scope of
    RHoK has now been widened to include any application that can have a
    major effect in the developing world. RHoK is now holding
    “community” events, such as the Waterhackathon, focusing on water
    sector&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="launch.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, Department of State, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIKE&lt;/span&gt; joined together to form
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; in an effort to identify, showcase and support innovative
    approaches to global challenges through a series of forums. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
    searches for visionaries, whose world-class ideas, technologies or
    programs show great promise for making tangible impacts on&amp;nbsp;society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="www.servirglobal.net"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; signed a five-year memorandum of understanding on
    April 25 2011. This agreement formalizes ongoing agency
    collaborations that use Earth science data to address developmental
    challenges, and to assist in disaster mitigation and humanitarian
    responses. The program integrates satellite observations,
    ground-based data and forecast models to monitor and forecast
    environmental changes and improve response to natural disasters in
    Central America, the Caribbean, Africa, and the Himalayas. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SERVIR&lt;/span&gt;
    helps inform science-based decision-making in the areas of climate
    change, health, agriculture environment, water and&amp;nbsp;weather.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As these initiatives reveal, the correlation between survival in Space
and Earth is significant and opens endless collaborative opportunities
between those exploring the universe and living on Earth.   We invite
you to share your ideas or efforts as we work together to highlight
those commonalities that benefit humanity. What other projects or
applications would you&amp;nbsp;suggest?&lt;/p&gt;

surfaced to not only rethink &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; the agency shares what it knows,
but &lt;em&gt;where&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Knowledge at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; doesn’t only live inside people’s heads. It’s in the
relationships between people, the space between people,” said Larry
Prusak, Editor-in-Chief of &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASK&lt;/span&gt; Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, in &lt;a href="https://sna.hq.nasa.gov/watch?v=yOF_Ir1YKl8"&gt;2006&lt;/a&gt;. “The
architecture of buildings is a great symbol and signal of cooperation
and collaboration. When you go into an office and see one hundred closed
doors, no open space, no space for talking, no space for meeting, it
[sends] a big&amp;nbsp;signal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of face-to-face collaboration, knowledge transfer, and
innovation is the reason why pharmaceutical company Novartis began
knocking down and rebuilding nearly twenty of its buildings in 2005.
It’s why Steve Jobs installed bathrooms in the atrium at Pixar, and
why &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask/issues/41/41i_potential.html"&gt;Fuji Xerox&lt;/a&gt; has rooms called “The Shipyard” and “The Brain.” All
these organizations recognized the importance of creating spaces that
enable people to collaborate and think&amp;nbsp;creatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr1722enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr1722enr.pdf"&gt;2010 Telework Enhancement Act&lt;/a&gt;, which provides employees
and managers with flexible work arrangements, and recent travel budget
cuts are forcing the agency to rethink how people work together, which
has added momentum to efforts across the agency to create collaborative
work spaces at the centers. These efforts, along with the increasingly
collaborative nature of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; projects and distributed teams, indicate a
growing interest in work spaces that are accessible, connected, and&amp;nbsp;flexible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Burning&amp;nbsp;Platform&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, Langley Research Center’s Navigation Center has
grown from 2,500 to 10,000 square feet. It consists of different-sized
rooms outfitted with projectors, tables, screens, whiteboards, wireless
Internet, and speakers. With trained facilitators available on-site, the
space is set up to enable creativity and connectivity. &amp;#8220;It’s an open
environment. We are known for being neutral territory,&amp;#8221; said Karen
Freidt, the team lead at the Navigation Center. “My office space
provides a variety of hotelling options [i.e., an unassigned work space]
for all. Employees can use the small desk, the treadmill desk, or the
air-hockey-combination-conference table as they please. If someone is
using a certain space, I just find another spot to&amp;nbsp;work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Navigation Center’s origin story starts in 1993, when the future of
Langley’s wind tunnels was threatened. Unless the center found a way to
increase efficiency and decrease cost, the tunnels would have to be shut
down entirely. The Wind Tunnel Enterprise (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTE&lt;/span&gt;), a team dedicated to
reinventing how Langley managed its wind tunnels, was created. Senior
decision makers—influenced by a five-day facilitated workshop that took
place in a collaborative environment—decided to establish a
collaborative working space called the Navigation Center to enable the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WTE&lt;/span&gt; to find a creative solution and save the&amp;nbsp;tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Navigation Center is much more than just the space. The employees,
especially those who have the expertise in facilitation, creativity and
innovation, are the heart and soul of this space.” said&amp;nbsp;Freidt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When an organization wants to do a major improvement to its processes,
it frequently takes a burning platform issue to make it happen,” said
Charlie Dunton, a senior facilitator at Navigation Center. “The
Navigation Center here at Langley formed under exactly those
circumstances.” If the organization fails to meet the demand in front of
it, it will likely crumble. “I think we may be seeing the same thing
going on with collaborative spaces at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,” said&amp;nbsp;Dunton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing on the&amp;nbsp;Wall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last August, David Miranda, a simulation engineer and in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;
Directorate and member of the Spaceport Innovators at Kennedy Space
Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;), got the go-ahead and a bit of funding from Pat Simpkins,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt; Director of Engineering, to find and outfit a space dedicated to
innovation at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;. “What that meant was whiteboards everywhere. Every
surface should be a place to share your ideas, which includes the walls
and the tables. In the future, we want to find ways to connect with
other rooms through video cameras and shared digital whiteboards,” said&amp;nbsp;Miranda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="KSC room" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/KSC-300x199.jpg" title="KSC room" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schematic of the Innovation Room at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;. (&lt;/em&gt;Image Credit: David&amp;nbsp;Miranda)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrently, Skip Owens, a systems engineer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;, is working with
Miranda to develop a space that allows engineers to take the product
from Miranda’s room (the idea) and then produce a design. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
already home to several integrated design centers, places for parallel
problem solving. (The center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also
called Team X, was recently featured in a Gizmodo &lt;a href="https://sna.hq.nasa.gov/5881653/,DanaInfo=gizmodo.com+this-is-how-spaceships-are-born"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt;.) Going to
the Moon? Get the flight design, thermal, and power engineers all in the
same space to crunch the numbers concurrently. Now, imagine if these
engineers were capable of doing this easily and effectively in virtual
space. “If you’re working on a particular design problem, you could
bring in an expert at Glenn or Goddard for a project at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;. You
wouldn’t have to travel. You could just plug in,” said Owens. “It’d be
really nice to know that you could always go into a room and interact
with your team that is spread out across all of these centers and have
that connectivity wherever you&amp;nbsp;go.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ability to effectively share voice, video, and data is critical,
Owens and Miranda explained. The standard methods of collaboration are
no longer enough for today’s work. “On a telecon, I can’t see what
you’re saying. With video, we can see each other faces, but we can’t
read each other’s minds,” said Miranda. “That’s where things like shared
whiteboards come in. It’s a way for me to show you my&amp;nbsp;mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Working, Learning, and Sharing Virtually&amp;nbsp;Anywhere&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, an informal, roving collaborative work session called “Co-Lab”
emerged at Langley just as the Navigation Center was gathering steam. An
individual would send out an email to the group, inviting everyone to a
new location each time. They’d eat lunch together and then whip out
laptops and paperwork and pick up with business as usual. “I really
found a lot of value in Co-Lab,” said Eileen Nelson, Executive Liaison
to Langley’s Chief Strategist and Speakers Bureau Manager at Langley.
“It was a great way to meet and network with other people, brainstorm
with them, and learn what other people at Langley are doing and how it
related to me.” The roving Co-Lab meetings lasted for about a&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson Space Center took a different approach: a fixed physical space
with a roving workforce. Located on the second floor of Building 29, the
“sp.ace” is outfitted with mobile tables, chairs, and whiteboards to
allow users to reconfigure the room to meet their needs. It is a place
where the traditional workforce meets the increasingly transient one
through the physical space and virtual space via online collaborative
tools. “Get out of your office and co-locate to work with your
colleagues”, wrote Christopher Gerty, a member of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Government
Team, on the open.nasa blog. “Share ideas and help each other look at
problems differently, brainstorm solutions, or maybe even just practice
that big presentation in front of an unbiased pair of&amp;nbsp;eyes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open, light, and flat, the sp.ace is an environment where people and
ideas can connect, collide, and coalesce. “By discussing issues with
folks who don’t have your same perspective, it seems easier to be
confident in the right solution to problems faster,” said Gerty.
“Connecting also seems less deliberate and more natural. It takes full
advantage of face-to-face&amp;nbsp;interaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After visiting the sp.ace, William Eshagh, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Research and Development
at Ames Research Center, returned home to California and started writing
a proposal for the Ames analog: the “sp.arc.” The space would be
reconfigurable like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; sp.ace. “Immoveable furniture is an
impediment to the creative process,” said Eshagh. “Not being able to
write on walls – we’ve been writing on walls since the Stone Age. It’s&amp;nbsp;natural!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/b4Y_tmsuXl4" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;William Eshagh, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Research and Development at Ames Research Center,
explains his remote whiteboarding project. (&lt;/em&gt;Video Credit: Video
courtesy of William&amp;nbsp;Eshagh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also proposed the space as a place to prototype new technologies.
Eshagh has been working on an initiative to enable agency-wide
collaboration through remote whiteboarding capabilities. This capability
would allow users from different locations to draw on the same virtual
whiteboard. The sp.arc would be a place for employees to test out
technologies like this and determine if they found them&amp;nbsp;useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Eshagh&amp;#8217;s proposal has yet to find a home at Ames, another nearby
space with a similar purpose just started to gain momentum. Located at
the Ames Research Park, “Connect Lab” acts as a place for anyone to work
and learn collaboratively across disciplines and to test out new
technologies (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;iPads).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I honestly think there’s something to these spaces. I don’t think this
is a fad,” said Eshagh. “Ames is surrounded by companies that understand
that it’s important to work in a place that fully allows you to be
creative. If we can’t attract new talent by demonstrating how
forward-leaning we are in the way we think about how we work with one
another and how we get things done, we&amp;#8217;re going to find that the bright
ones will go somewhere&amp;nbsp;else.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Making It&amp;nbsp;Happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major determining factor of the success of collaborative spaces is if
they are accessible to everyone. These spaces tend to succeed if they
are equipped with the right capability (e.g., wireless Internet
capability, electrical outlets, screens, etc.), are easily accessible
(e.g., no locked doors, no unnecessary layers of security, and not far
removed), and have community&amp;nbsp;buy-in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Money,” said Miranda, “isn’t a deal breaker.” For instance, he asked,
why buy additional whiteboards if you can use the frosted glass walls in
a room? “The whole room can be a canvas for your ideas,” said Miranda.
Sometimes all that’s needed is permission to utilize the space and
resources that already&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to create collaborative spaces are not confined to Langley,
Kennedy, Ames, and Johnson. The next steps involve finding ways for
center-based collaborative spaces to work with one another. “We’re
paying attention to what each other’s groups are doing,” said Dunton.
“As these spaces pop up across the agency, we need think about&amp;nbsp;connectivity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benefits of collaboration include unexpected synergies, diversity of
thought, better products, and cross-pollination of ideas. These
benefits, while seemingly intangible, are what drive innovation and
organizational progress. Creating a space where ideas can thrive is
increasingly important in today’s project&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ASK the Academy"></category><category term="collaboration"></category><category term="collaborative spaces"></category><category term="telework"></category><category term="Virtual"></category></entry><entry><title>NASA Joins Yahoo for ‘Flight Readiness Review’ of Space Apps Challenges</title><link href="/nasa-joins-yahoo-for-flight-readiness-review-of-space-apps-challenges" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-23T16:49:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kristen Painting</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-23:nasa-joins-yahoo-for-flight-readiness-review-of-space-apps-challenges</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge is a unique event unlike anything
we’ve done before.  Teams of passionate people from around the world
will be working together on April 21st and 22nd to create solutions to
challenges for which they would have previously had no connection.  How
do you prepare for an event like that?  How do you take challenges that
deal with space, technology and society and prepare them to be worked by
people who are simply passionate to volunteer their talents to see what
they can accomplish on the challenges placed before&amp;nbsp;them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided this was a rather large task, and so we enlisted the help of
some very dedicated Yahoos.  (Yes, &lt;em&gt;Yahoos&lt;/em&gt;.)  On April 10, 2012, the
Yahoo! Developer Network in the California Bay Area will be hosting an
International Space Apps Challenge “prelaunch” event.  This will be the
kickoff for the creating, building and inventing that will happen during
the Apps Challenge itself.  The team of Yahoo Developers and other
volunteers will take time to go through the challenges and then work in
teams to develop them into strong problem statements to be worked on the
weekend of the event itself.  Ultimately we hope to identify data and
information that may not be supplied but can be collected prior to the
Challenge, and have input for possible solution starting points.  In
space terms, it’s our “flight readiness review” of the&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge will be a collaborative event
involving individuals from around the world.  We are excited that we
have some of those incredibly talented individuals so close-by and
excited to support the mission of the Challenge.  If you are interested
in joining the Yahoo Developer Network pre-event you can visit the

flattening of the globe of the eye&lt;/a&gt;causing some major issues for
current and former astronauts.  It turns out, I know a lot about these
issues.  Let me be clear though, I&amp;#8217;m not the medical expertise in the
team, but I&amp;#8217;m part of the team, or should I say, part of one of the
teams, that&amp;#8217;s looking into what it is that&amp;#8217;s causing our astronauts
potential eyesight and long-term issues.  You don&amp;#8217;t see an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.D.&lt;/span&gt; after my
name, but I still play an integral role in trying to figure out what&amp;#8217;s
going on to our human bodies in space and some of the potential
countermeasures we might be able to employ once we figure all that out. 
I&amp;#8217;m a small part of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; calls the Space Medicine Division, more
specifically I&amp;#8217;m an employee of &lt;a href="http://www.wyle.com/" title="Wyle, an integral part of NASA's Human Health and Performance contract"&gt;Wyle&lt;/a&gt; - the prime contractor for
the Bioastronautics contract.  Within Space Medicine and within
&lt;a href="http://www.wyle.com/STE/Pages/default.aspx" title="Wyle's Science Technology and Engineering Group"&gt;Wyle&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;#8217;m part of a small group of very talented, and very diverse
group of individuals that make up the Advanced Projects&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bet you&amp;#8217;re now wondering a few things, none the least of which is,
there&amp;#8217;s a &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/spacemed/" title="NASA's Space Medicine"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPACE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MEDICINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?  And &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ADVANCED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PROJECTS&lt;/span&gt;?!  That sounds
crazy!  I can assure you, I&amp;#8217;m not doing any alien autopsy kind of stuff
here, but I am a small part of what&amp;#8217;s going on behind the scenes to keep
our astronauts healthy, happy, and fully functional in space.   And the
most important part of this whole thing - I love my&amp;nbsp;job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you the 10-second &amp;#8216;elevator pitch&amp;#8217; of what it is my group
does so we can just go back to why the heck I enjoy spending half my
life in the office, 5 days a week, all year&amp;nbsp;round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are engineers, clinicians, and scientists working together to develop
requirements, protocols, procedures, software, and hardware to keep our
astronauts healthy.  We have a medical simulation laboratory (that I
helped to outfit!) and a prototyping lab.  We&amp;#8217;re capable of designing
and running experiments; building quick-turn prototypes; and just about
anything else that Space Medicine, or anyone else at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; might need if
we have the expertise to do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there it is, that&amp;#8217;s what we do.  Still confused?  Honestly, when it
comes down to it, we try to provide solutions and ways forward for the
problems and issues that come up in human space flight.  And it turns
out, a lot of the issues that come up in space flight actually have a
lot of analogues and terrestrial uses if you just continue to follow the
rabbit down the hole (sometimes not that far at all).  Therein lies one
of the greatest parts of my job - I get to have a small part of some of
the most cutting edge medicine out there, some of which you probably
won&amp;#8217;t even see for 10 years or more.  If you don&amp;#8217;t think &lt;a href="http://spinoff.nasa.gov/" title="Here are just some of the things that 'spin off' from NASA work, check it out, you'd be amazed. "&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; affects
your lives daily&lt;/a&gt;, and I mean, daily, then well, let me tell you more
about it &amp;#8212;- because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s involvement colors our lives - even, or
rather, especially, in&amp;nbsp;medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;#8217;m doing from one day to another could change drastically and it
keeps me ever on my toes.  I could be representing our research team at
the opening of the new &lt;a href="http://brc.rice.edu/home/" title="The BioScience Research Collaborative"&gt;BioScience Research Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; for
the&lt;a href="http://www.nsbri.org/" title="The National Space Biomedical Research Institute"&gt;National Space Biomedical Research Institute&lt;/a&gt;one day and I could
be designing a test bed for a human test subject study the next. 
There&amp;#8217;s just so much to do and so very little resources sometimes, that
we get a lot of opportunities to grow and gain skills we would have
never thought&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of those out there who are still wondering what the heck Space
Medicine is, trust me, I was in the same boat before I got this job!  I
didn&amp;#8217;t have the slightest clue as to the existence of this division
until I quite literally came upon this job just doing what I love to do
- work with my hands and help others.  I&amp;#8217;ll leave the long story for
another time, but I found myself helping a very nice person with her
motorcycle issues, and found myself on the other end of a job offer. &amp;nbsp;Fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I studied Electrical Engineering from the &lt;a href="http://www.engr.utexas.edu/" title="Cockrell School of Engineering, Hook 'em!"&gt;University of Texas at
Austin&lt;/a&gt;(yay!) and I started life in this world with a tough decision,
do I stay in &lt;a href="www.austintexas.org/" title="good ol' Austin, TX, yeehaw y'all!"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; and help design/sell microchips, or do I go back
to &lt;a href="http://downtownhouston.org" title="Houston is a fantastic place! Here's a good place to figure out what's going on this week"&gt;Houston&lt;/a&gt;and play with &lt;a href="http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/" title="Astronaut Bios, some of the most amazing people you'll ever read about!"&gt;astronauts&lt;/a&gt;(I&amp;#8217;m sure the choice was much
more intricate than that, but I swear that&amp;#8217;s what the argument sounds
like inside my current memories).  Well, I don&amp;#8217;t know about the general
public, but playing with astronauts just sounded like something I
couldn&amp;#8217;t pass up and here I am, 8 years later, in wait&amp;#8230; Space
Medicine?  Well ok!  I&amp;#8217;m still &amp;#8216;playing with astronauts&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; somehow I
also get to say I work for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Space Medicine!  And I&amp;#8217;m an Electrical
Engineer of all things.  Luckily, I actually get to use those &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EE&lt;/span&gt; skills
quite a bit here - building and designing electronic circuits, hardware,
software, critical thinking and analysis.  But somehow I also get to
learn about the scientific process; design and run experiments and
studies; and work with some of the most amazing people this side of the
&lt;a href="http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/eyes" title="This is a super cool link with 3D flybys of our solarsystem... "&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;#8217;t - and most certainly do not - discount the fact that I get to
work with an entire subset of amazing people &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int" title="The European Space Agency, just one of the worldwide partners with NASA"&gt;worldwide&lt;/a&gt;who genuinely
love the industry they work in.  For any of you who are just beginning
your careers or are not quite sure where you&amp;#8217;ll end up, do something you
believe in - something you love.  It really shows.  And it really
matters.  Believe me when I say I am nowhere near the top of the totem
pole in technical prowess, brainpower, accolades, etc., when it comes to
this industry, but I don&amp;#8217;t ever think this is a bad thing at all.  I
feel lucky to be a part of such a group of people who genuinely arrive
at work everyday because they know they want to be here.  These are
people that I collect inspiration from and learn from on a daily basis. 
The kind of people who work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; don&amp;#8217;t work here for the money.  We
show up to work because we believe in what we do and for me, I genuinely
love the people I work with, from the people I work directly with
everyday, to Human Resources, Purchasing, Shipping and Receiving,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;, heck, everyone who has a hand in making what I do worthwhile - which
funny enough, includes &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt;, the person reading this right now, because
this, this is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOUR&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/NASAtelevision" title="Videos, because you know you love watching them"&gt;Space Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Advanced Projects"></category><category term="humans in space"></category><category term="I am NASA"></category><category term="life sciences"></category><category term="medicine"></category><category term="prototypes"></category><category term="Space Medicine"></category></entry><entry><title>#SpaceApps: Space Makes Anything Possible</title><link href="/spaceapps-space-makes-anything-possible" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-18T22:59:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-18:spaceapps-space-makes-anything-possible</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What exactly is a space app? What could you do with all that data,
anyway? And how can we use space to improve life on&amp;nbsp;Earth? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first night of the first codeathon-type event I ever attended, I
saw this quote from Herb Kelleher posted on the wall: “We have a
strategic plan, it’s called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THINGS&lt;/span&gt;.” And that’s the key to what’s
going to happen at the Apps Challenge: we’re in this to &lt;strong&gt;do things&lt;/strong&gt;.
We’re in this to &lt;strong&gt;make things&lt;/strong&gt;. We’re in this because we believe that
the questions that motivate us to explore space can change the way we
live here on Earth and the way the next generation will continue to
explore, and we’re ready to see where that takes&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To stir up your imagination, the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; team has assembled
this list of some of the coolest apps we have seen recently using space
data, space experience, or just plain space &lt;strong&gt;awesomeness&lt;/strong&gt;. They
include software and hardware, science and art, education outreach and
creative ideation. Some of these apps originated as official &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
projects; some are the work of engaged, inspired citizens. Nearly all
demonstrate the vital importance of &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/30/introducing-data-nasa-gov/"&gt;open data&lt;/a&gt; and the scientific and
technological possibilities it&amp;nbsp;creates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can read more &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/blog/2012/03/01/software-hardware-data-visualization-and-citizen-s/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; about the four types of challenges we will

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/13/space-ipsum/"&gt;Space Ipsum Generator&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;/strong&gt;created by Sean Herron, Nick Skytland,
and William&amp;nbsp;Eshagh)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;software/ open data&amp;nbsp;app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum is the standard filler text used in design throughout the
world. It’s been the standards since the 1500’s and it’s time for an
update. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; OpenGov team took the opportunity at Science Hack Day
to create a new online tool to generate filler text based on a database
of historical space quotes. The project serves as an example of what can
be done to utilize historic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data and mash it up in a new and
exciting way. Although a “lorem ipsum” generator may seem
inconsequential at first glance, the weekend project will serve as the
backbone to a future data mashup project for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; OpenGov&amp;nbsp;team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Ipsum site also perhaps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s first experiment in responsive
design – the idea the content should not dictate the look and feel of
the site.  No matter what type of platform you view the website on,
you’ll always be able to access it’s core features due to the use of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS3&lt;/span&gt; media queries. This is an evolution in web design and represents
the future of how web design should act.  The site also features some of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s historic space images that load as the background randomly when a

&lt;p&gt;Galaxy Zoo: Hubble uses gorgeous imagery of hundreds of thousands of
galaxies drawn from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Hubble Space Telescope archive. To understand
how these galaxies, and our own, formed we need your help to classify
them according to their shapes — a task at which your brain is better
than even the most advanced computer. If you&amp;#8217;re quick, you may even be
the first person in history to see each of the galaxies you&amp;#8217;re asked to&amp;nbsp;classify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 250,000 people have taken part in Galaxy Zoo so far, producing
a wealth of valuable data and sending telescopes on Earth and in space
chasing after their discoveries. The images used in Galaxy Zoo: Hubble
are more detailed and beautiful than ever, and will allow us to look
deeper into the Universe than ever before. To begin exploring, click the

&lt;p&gt;YouTube Space Lab is an amazing competition and a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity which you could be a part of. All you have to do is come up
with an idea. It should be fun and you might learn some interesting
stuff about space in the process. If that&amp;#8217;s not enough, we&amp;#8217;re giving you
the chance to win some great prizes. From all the submissions we get,
one winning team (or individual if you enter alone) will be chosen in
each region of the world (The Americas; Europe, Middle-East and Africa;
Asia-Pacific) from each of the two age categories (14 - 16, 17 - 18),
making six regional winners overall. The regional winners will win a
free trip to Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;D.C.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USA&lt;/span&gt; for a special event in March 2012,
where they&amp;#8217;ll also get to take an exhilarating zero-G flight, which lets
you experience weightlessness, and they&amp;#8217;ll each receive Lenovo IdeaPads.
At the special event, two of the regional winners will be selected as
global winners. The global winners&amp;#8217; experiments will be performed by
astronauts aboard the International Space Station and they&amp;#8217;ll win a
amazing once-in-a-lifetime space experience of their&amp;nbsp;choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of &lt;em&gt;SpaceLab for iOS&lt;/em&gt; is to demonstrate that an inexpensive
consumer electronics device can perform tasks previously reserved for
expensive single purpose devices.  Modern smart phones contain hardware
once only found in expensive avionics.  Where an avionics box may have
had a limited production run of 100′s or 1000′s of devices, a smart
phone may have a similar engineer investment but a longer production run
of millions, which significantly lowers the cost for users of the
device.  The goal of this project is to significantly lower the cost of
space flight and lower the barrier to access in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the absence of weather station data, Meteorological Satellite
Information (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt;) is crucial to estimating local climate.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt; is
used worldwide to understand climate change effects, formulating
strategies for disaster risk management, and analyzing the gap between
water supply and demand. This knowledge, especially precipitation
behavior – main supplier of water - allows countries to promote
effective planning for fighting poverty. However, while &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt; can estimate
climate where there aren&amp;#8217;t any weather station, the accuracy of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt;
depends heavily on field data (weather stations on the ground) to
calibrate outputs. Therefore, there is a contradiction here: if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt;
requires field data for accuracy, how can &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt; be useful in places where
no weather station data is available? The first challenge is to bring
together satellite and ground information for users in real time and
create a tool which will produce a geospatial representation of both
sources of information. The first challenge was already accomplished
during the RhoK in Philadelphia. The second challenge is to generate an
&amp;#8220;averaged&amp;#8221; geospatial map from the combination of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MSI&lt;/span&gt; and the ground&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not content just to have iPhones on the Station, Android phones had to
join the fun too. The NexusOne PhoneSat project aims to determine if
low-cost mobile phone components can withstand space travel. The phones
must withstand extreme vibrations on the way to reaching orbit, function
properly in a vacuum and operate at both extremely high and low
temperatures. Go &lt;a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/nasa-to-launch-inexpensive-android-phonesats-into-space/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to read more about the&amp;nbsp;collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

stimulate interest of children in Science, Technology, Engineering and
Math (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;) and bring the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; space exploration experience to the
classroom, museum and ultimately the living room. Using the Kinect game
controller &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt; allows children to engage in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s missions in a
fundamentally new way. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt; allows children to experiment with gravity
on Mars and the Moon; navigate through the International Space Station;
fix a torn solar array on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;; drive a robot on Mars; visit an
Asteroid; learn about the differences in gravity on different planets
and control Robonaut 2 using their body as the input&amp;nbsp;device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt; complements &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s outreach investments in television,
mobile platforms and the web by engaging the public through the rapidly
expanding medium of console gaming. In 2008, [97% of teenagers played
video games and 86% played on a home gaming console][]. As of March
2011, there have been &lt;a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2011/03/10/ki%20nect-record-brea%20king-sales-figu%20res-top-10-million/"&gt;more than 10 million Kinects sold&lt;/a&gt;. Project
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt; interacts with children on a platform on which they spend much of
their time and teaches them information about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; while they are having&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt; progressed from completely custom C++ code written in house
to using a commercial game engine. The art work and 3D geometry models
come from existing engineering work or are created by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt;
development team. Six different &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KEWL&lt;/span&gt; applications have been demonstrated
at nine different venues including schools, museums, conferences, and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; outreach events . These demonstrations have allowed the developers
the chance to interact with players and observe the gameplay mechanics
in action . The lessons learned were then incorporated into the
subsequent versions of the&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;

results in concrete software solutions that can be implemented to
address critical challenges.   A codeathon celebrates software
development in its most positive context—using minimal resources and
maximum brainpower to create outside-the-box solutions in response to
interesting problems.  Codeathon events are technology development
marathons, drawing on the talents and initiative of the best and the
brightest software developers, engineers, designers and technologists
from around the world, who volunteer their time to respond to real-world
problems with solutions than can have immediate&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As our team leads preparations for the upcoming &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space
Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, I find myself frequently addressing a specific
question: &lt;em&gt;why a codeathon&lt;/em&gt;? Why not a more traditional innovation
challenge, or research partnership, or just a request for proposal? It
works for tech companies, but can it really work for&amp;nbsp;government?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonight I came across this excellent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; talk by Code for America
founder &lt;a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/jen/"&gt;Jennifer Pahlka&lt;/a&gt; called Coding for Better Government.
Jennifer doesn’t just describe the apps that her developers are
creating, but she argues for the way &lt;strong&gt;technology can help engage
citizens to reframe the way government works&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you aren’t familiar with &lt;a href="http://codeforamerica.org/"&gt;Code for America&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a public service
opportunity that engages the “web generation” in fellowships to help
governments work better. “Code for America helps governments become more
connected, lean, and participatory through new opportunities for public
service &amp;#8212; both inside and outside government &amp;#8212; so we&amp;#8217;re not only
making a direct impact everyday, but also creating the relationships and
network for lasting&amp;nbsp;change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/n4EhJ898r-k" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tim O’Reilly noted, government, at its core, is about &lt;strong&gt;doing
together what we can’t do alone&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s why we believe that &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/26/citizen-engagement/"&gt;citizen
engagement is vital for space exploration&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s the key to answer
‘why a&amp;nbsp;codeathon.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, the better process of a codeathon has the ability to
provide a better product because it engages a full community of citizens
in the real work of their government. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;’s Chief Digital
Officer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rachelsterne"&gt;Rachel Sterne&lt;/a&gt; recently addressed the power of codeathons in
government, noting that collaboration bridges sectors and connects the
government and technology communities with a shared challenge,
encouraging collaborative problem solving and a more open government.
Codeathons create a mechanism for the public to share feedback and ideas
via access to government decision makers. Creative and innovative
concepts are introduced that help evolve government to be more efficient
and effective. Codeathons also feature an open design process, equipping
developers directly with the data that they need and clearly
demonstrating what the public wants and&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Politics is not changing; &lt;em&gt;government&lt;/em&gt; is changing, and because
government ultimately derives its power from us (remember we the
people) &lt;strong&gt;how we think about it is going to affect how that change
happens&lt;/strong&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events like the Apps Challenge really do represent how a new generation
is tackling the problem of government: with collective action. We need
engaged citizens who are contributing their skills and talents to the
core mission of exploring the unknown and pioneering the future. The key
to improving life on Earth – and enabling us to explore further into the
universe – is to roll up our sleeves, do it together, and then let it go
viral, just like Jennifer&amp;nbsp;describes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[This generation isn’t] fighting that battle we’re all fighting about
who gets to speak – they &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; get to speak. They don’t care so much
about using their voices… they are using their hands to make their
communities better. When it comes to the big things we need to do
together, are we just going to be a crowd of &lt;em&gt;voices&lt;/em&gt;? Or are we also
going to be a crowd of &lt;em&gt;hands&lt;/em&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These exceptional individuals engage their fellow undergraduate and
graduate students in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; science, technology, engineering and
mathematics (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;), as well as participate in research and immersion
opportunities. They collaborate with and inspire their peers, make
professional connections and represent &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to the public. We have
invited some of them to share their stories here. This week, Shujaat
Ahmed, from the industrial/organizational psychology program at Illinois
Institute of Technology, describes her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;experience. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people think of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, they usually think of engineers or
scientists. Truth be told, there are other areas within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; such as
&lt;a href="http://nasapeople.nasa.gov/"&gt;human capital&lt;/a&gt; that also support the mission. Having said that, I
think it is important to point out some of the work these lesser-known
areas do and the contributions that are made to the exploration mission.
I would like to start by highlighting some of my experiences and why it
is helpful to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off, I initially became involved in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; after a friend who was
majoring in computer science told me he was interning at the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory during the summer of 2008. Since then, I realized
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; did have an &lt;a href="https://intern.nasa.gov/solar/web/public/main/index.cfm?solarAction=view&amp;amp;subAction=content&amp;amp;contentCode=HOME_PAGE_INTERNSHIPS"&gt;internship program for students&lt;/a&gt;. However, only
after I researched the web and found the website listed with various
opportunities (a couple of which were in my field), was I aware that I
could have a remote chance of being a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; intern. Being a psychology
student, I felt unique during my two internship experiences in that I
was surrounded by mostly engineers but I was alright with it. While I
may not have understood difficult engineering concepts outside of my
major, I brought a different perspective to the table given my diverse
educational background and&amp;nbsp;experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my first internship in the summer of 2010, I conducted a study
examining the personality traits of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Marshall Space Flight Center
engineers and the impact that had on the structure and culture of the
organization. This study is important because it suggests that in order
for this organization to thrive and be effective in a business
environment that is characterized by change and competition, the
engineers need to be able to&amp;nbsp;adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most recent internship during the summer of 2011 involved using
workforce analytics to guide succession planning within Goddard Space
Flight Center. Here I analyzed 10 years worth of data for the
engineering directorate to find gaps in the analyses and determine where
the directorate needed to fill the gaps. This work is important because
it has brought that directorate and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSFC&lt;/span&gt; one step closer to having a
formal succession plan in place. I am positive my work will help prepare
the engineering directorate and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSFC&lt;/span&gt; in identifying, assessing, and
developing employees to make certain they are ready to take on key roles
when the person higher up in their pipeline leaves, while ensuring
knowledge is successfully passed on to and retained by the employee
assuming the new key&amp;nbsp;role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In both of my internship experiences, I am honored to have played a role
(indirectly) in trying to keep &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; alive as an organization and to keep
moving forward. This is because of the influence and impact of the
internship projects I mentioned earlier have had in helping &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
employees adapt during the economic turmoil and in retaining knowledge
for developing employees as they fill in new roles when a person leaves.
While I am excited to have been given opportunities to make an
impression, &lt;em&gt;my journey with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is not over yet&lt;/em&gt;. In the future, I
hope to work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; fulltime, improving different areas within human
capital management, whether it is implementing more effective training
strategies, helping with employee productivity and engagement, or
something else. I want to continue supporting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; because ever since I
became a part of this organization, the people around me have been very
kind, caring, and the climate and culture at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, I hope my experiences have shed light on some of the work
that other areas, such as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s office of human capital management are
involved in. More importantly, I hope I have provided some motivation to
people to stay focused and be engaged in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
best resource are its people and it is up to all of us to make a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My colleague Jon Rogers (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/ileddigital"&gt;@iledigital&lt;/a&gt;) told me that he had just ‘had
the Skype of a lifetime’. &lt;strong&gt;I guess this is the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; effect&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
holds, for many, the sense of adventure and exploration that is often
lacking from our everyday lives. For many kids &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the space
programme are an inspiration that lead them to a wide variety of careers
in science and engineering as well as being a dream, that one day they
could end up in space. And now &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; wanted to work with&amp;nbsp;us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon is a product designer at the University of Dundee and runs our
successful &lt;a href="http://productdesign.dundee.ac.uk/msc/"&gt;MSc in Product Design&lt;/a&gt;. His &lt;a href="http://productresearch.dundee.ac.uk/"&gt;research emphasis&lt;/a&gt; is
on &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://mozillafestival.org/tag/physical-apps/"&gt;physical apps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which as he explains it are a way to take
information or data from the internet and connect that to a real world
device. He will be showcasing examples of this work making use of &lt;a href="http://www.novalia.co.uk/"&gt;paper
circuitry&lt;/a&gt; (and how it can save the music industry(!) )
at &lt;a href="http://austin.lanyrd.com/ileddigital"&gt;SxSW&lt;/a&gt; this week. Physical apps are a way of making the web&amp;nbsp;physical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/apollo/"&gt;Apollo&lt;/a&gt; rockets made use of computers that are puny in terms
of the processing power, storage capacity and memory of your average
smartphone. And what do we use this awesome power for? To send the odd
email and play Angry Birds. Since the 1960’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has invested huge
amounts in space exploration and in the novel technology to work in the
harshest of environments, and in doing so has collected huge amounts of
data and made many significant technical innovations. They now want to
harness these archives to try and make “practical applications that
benefit&amp;nbsp;humanity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And they want everyone to help.&lt;/strong&gt; Can you, as a citizen of the world,
make some contribution to the big challenges that face the world? Does
that seem daunting? By working together with similarly concerned
citizens from throughout the world, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; believes that by sharing your
expertise you can make a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="attachment_327"&gt;

*Powering lasers with an Arduino. Can you &amp;#8216;make&amp;#8217; a difference?*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; invited people to make suggestions about grand challenges that
could be solved making use of their data and expertise. Perhaps
unsurprisingly the initial tranche of suggestions were software based.
To help define some more “physical” ideas &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; asked Dundee for some
help. &lt;strong&gt;We want to make, rather than just&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beauty of a University environment is that it is a microcosm of the
world outside, with a huge range of skills and outlooks, races and
creeds all crammed into a small campus. This means we are ideally suited
to see what happens when people with different skill sets come together
and work on problems. Jon and I had been looking for something to work
on for a while, but it’s not always obvious what a product designer and
an optical physicist can do for each other, but with space and some
shared childhood dreams we were able to see how our mutual expertise
could try and help define what physical apps could mean for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and I am forgetting the jeweller. &lt;a href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/staff/sandrawilson/"&gt;Sandra Wilson&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Gold1"&gt;@Gold1&lt;/a&gt;)
designs jewellery at the University’s &lt;a href="http://www.dundee.ac.uk/djcad/"&gt;Duncan of Jordanstone Art
College&lt;/a&gt;. This is not ordinary jewellery though, it’s linked into
ideas about identity and we thought that a physical app, at it’s most
straightforward would be something you could wear – &lt;em&gt;you can wear
‘space’&lt;/em&gt;. Looking a bit further ahead, jewellery makes it fairly
straightforward to embed technology within it, but the challenge might
be how to power that device and how to connect it to a data&amp;nbsp;source?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first port of call was to the MSc Product Design students and we set
them the task of thinking about what data is and how this can be
visualized in a physical manner, and also about how ideas of space link
back to life on Earth. Where do the challenges lie? The full list of
ideas will be live on the &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges"&gt;space apps challenge page&lt;/a&gt;, but here’s one
to give you a flavour of what a space physical app might&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Maker Faire is a celebration of people making their own stuff, usually
with a technological bent, but more generally it’s all about having
ideas and turning them into a reality. Making stuff. Making stuff for
fun, for everyday use, maybe even for&amp;nbsp;profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We want you to try and make stuff – some of that will be grand theme and
grand idea type challenges, but we want to start with something a bit
more homely. Can we bring a little piece of home to astronauts in
the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;. If you are stuck up in a confined
space whizzing round the earth for months, if not years, at a time, you
are going to miss the odd home comfort. Can humans survive on trips to
further flung reaches of the solar system without the odd reminder of&amp;nbsp;home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We thought that little says ‘home’ like home baking. With yeast being a
model organism for many experiments, and as it often finds itself in
zero-g conditions, it seems a natural extension to try and make
something with it: bread. How will bread bake in space? And a key
technological challenge is, since baking takes a lot of energy, can we
device new low power techniques that can be applied on the Space
Station, and then ultimately in the new low power homes back on Earth
that we will need in the&amp;nbsp;future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We call this challenge &lt;strong&gt;#bakerfaire&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We call on makers, bakers, bread lovers, food scientists, product
designers, electrical engineers and tinkerers everywhere to come and
develop physical apps and hardware as part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; International
Space Challenge. Come help us bring home into space, and in doing so,
help us shape a better&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;P.S.&lt;/span&gt; If anyone fancies making me a little device that warns when the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;
is about to pass overhead, that’s the simple physical space app that I
would really&amp;nbsp;love!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;! Last September, we &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/sep/HQ_11-313_Space_Apps.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;
that we would be hosting the two-day event as part of the United States’
domestic commitments to the &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"&gt;Open Government Partnership&lt;/a&gt;. Since then,
we have been hard at work planning the collaborative technology
development event during which citizens from around the world will work
together to solve current challenges relevant to both space exploration
and social&amp;nbsp;need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Apps Challenge will be held on all seven
continents on April 21-22, 2012. Locations in which events are currently
planned to be held include &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/techshop"&gt;San Francisco, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/university-of-tokyo"&gt;Tokyo, Japan&lt;/a&gt;;
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/vssec"&gt;Melbourne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/anu"&gt;Canberra, Australia&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/at-america"&gt;Jakarta, Indonesia&lt;/a&gt;;

Brazil&lt;/a&gt;; Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/mcmurdo"&gt;McMurdo Station,
Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges for the event address both 1) strategic exploration needs
and 2) strategic social need, and are organized into four categories
including: 1) &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;open source software&lt;/a&gt;, 2) &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;open hardware&lt;/a&gt;, 3) &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;data visualization&lt;/a&gt;, and 4)
&lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/"&gt;citizen science platforms&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8217;ll be adding 2-5
new challenges per week to the site between now and the event, so check
back often to join the project teams and related&amp;nbsp;discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been very fortunate to work with a number of government entities
and other organizations around the world in preparation of today’s
announcement. We are truly thankful for their&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We anticipate a lot of interest in the event, so makes sure to

the day, highlighting the role women play at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The site was created
in response to the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-White-House-Council-on-Women-and-Girls/"&gt;Executive Order, signed March 11, 2009&lt;/a&gt;,
establishing the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/cwg"&gt;White House Council on Women and Girls&lt;/a&gt;. Chaired by
the heads of every agency and major White House office across the
federal government, the Council aims to provide a coordinated federal
response to issues that have a distinct impact on women and
girls. The &lt;a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/newui/blog/viewpostlist.jsp?blogname=womenatnasa"&gt;Women@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; blog&lt;/a&gt; is also featured on the site,
highlighting additional personal stories and contributions from diverse
women all across the&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/bolden_bio.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Administrator Charles Bolden&lt;/a&gt; and the Office of Science and
Technology Policy&amp;#8217;s Assistant Director for National Security Patricia
Falcone closed out the event with a great interactive dialogue with the&amp;nbsp;audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we hope that the Women@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; site and events like today will
support a collaborative and supportive community of women at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and
serve as the hub of all activity related to women’s issues at the
agency. In addition, we hope that these stories will inspire
girls &lt;em&gt;everywhere&lt;/em&gt; to reach for the stars, and explore the myriad of
opportunities available to them through pursuing careers in science,
technology, engineering and&amp;nbsp;mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

used physics in the battle between birds and pigs in the video game
Angry Birds. In cooperation with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, Finland-based Rovio
Entertainment, creator of the Angry Birds franchise, announced its
newest game, &amp;#8221;&lt;a href="http://www.angrybirds.com/space"&gt;Angry Birds Space&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; on Thursday, March 8. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and
Rovio are working together to teach people about physics and space
exploration through the internationally successful puzzle&amp;nbsp;game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Game developers have incorporated concepts of human space
exploration into the new game. From the weightlessness of space to the
gravity wells of nearby planets, players use physics as they explore
the various levels of the game set both on planets and in&amp;nbsp;microgravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/lxI1L1RiSJQ" frameborder="0" width="640" height="360"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;This collaboration began with a simple Twitter exchange about birds and
pigs in space, and it has grown into a tremendous outreach and education
opportunity,&amp;#8221; said David Weaver, associate administrator for
communications at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Headquarters in Washington. &amp;#8220;Games are fun and
entertaining, but they also can be inspirational and informative. This
ongoing collaboration with Rovio and Angry Birds is an exciting way to
get people engaged with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s missions of exploration and discovery,
and get students energized about future careers in science and&amp;nbsp;technology.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aboard the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/station"&gt;International Space Station&lt;/a&gt;, Flight Engineer Don Pettit
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; created a video using Angry Birds Space to explain how physics
works in space, including demonstrating trajectories in &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/microgravity"&gt;microgravity&lt;/a&gt;
by catapulting an Angry Bird through the space station. The video was
shown this week to an audience at the South by Southwest Conferences and
Festivals, an annual convention of original music, independent films,
and emerging technologies in Austin, Texas. It is also available on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s website at&amp;nbsp;http://www.nasa.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;We focused on every detail in development of Angry Birds Space to build
a special experience for our fans,&amp;#8221; said Peter Vesterbacka, chief
marketing officer and mighty eagle of Rovio Entertainment. &amp;#8220;I believe we
have succeeded well with the game, and we wanted to create something as
unique around our launch events. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has been the perfect partner for
our Angry Birds Space program, and we can&amp;#8217;t wait to work with them on
creating more compelling educational&amp;nbsp;experiences.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Angry Birds"></category><category term="games"></category><category term="microgravity"></category><category term="space"></category><category term="sxsw"></category></entry><entry><title>Space to Ground: NASA at #SXSW</title><link href="/space-to-ground-nasa-at-sxsw" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-03-07T12:41:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2012-03-07:space-to-ground-nasa-at-sxsw</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Space is well-represented at #SXSWi, with a number of interactive

are just some of the reasons why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is here at #SXSWi and some of the
ways you can engage &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; space&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We honestly believe that everyone has a contribution they can make to
the exploration mission, and we have some amazing opportunities coming
up where you can connect with other software developers and creative
thinkers to work on short-term projects that could change the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A License to RHoK&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10214"&gt;5pm, Sunday, March 11&lt;/a&gt;) will highlight
&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt;, a global initiative to create practical
open source solutions to humanity’s toughest challenges. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
joining with partners Google and Microsoft as well as Secondmuse to
share how you can change the world with your mad hacking skills, what
you can expect at a marathon coding event, what kind of technology
success stories have come out of RHoK… and how you can join us for the
upcoming &lt;a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; in April and for RHoK
Global in&amp;nbsp;June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to explore the unknown… and #&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt; has lots of people,
ideas, and technologies that could help us do that better. We are ready
to share some of the latest developments in our technology portfolios
and how the government is using prizes to help incentivize&amp;nbsp;breakthrough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the session &lt;strong&gt;Government as a Catalyst: Prizes for Tech
Innovation&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP11048"&gt;11am, Tuesday, March 13&lt;/a&gt;), we’ll look at some new
approaches to technology innovation. Federal agencies have recently
been given the authority by Congress to sponsor competitions for
individuals, groups, and companies to develop new ideas and technology
innovations for a chance to win potentially lucrative prizes. These
competitions can range from new mobile outreach technologies to
web-based data analytics tools to even vehicle-to-vehicle
communications; the government is looking for breakthrough
technologies from the minds of the most innovative and forward
thinking Americans, many of whom are at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;. You’ll hear some of our
more interesting prizes and how effective they have been in
stimulating tech&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/"&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; – in some pretty unconventional ways. We
are looking forward to sharing stories about how we are engaging the
public to get them involved in the coolest mission on Earth – and in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Out of this World Engagement (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP13786"&gt;11am, Sunday, March 11&lt;/a&gt;) will
feature a conversation between the nation’s space agency and the
world’s largest museum and research complex about how they have
embraced the use of social media to reach out, engage new audiences,
engage existing audiences in new ways, and give the public
behind-the-scenes&amp;nbsp;access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We love great movies as much as anyone else – but we also know that a
good film isn’t necessarily a true story.  We’ll give you the real
lowdown about asteroids (along with our friend the &lt;a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/"&gt;Bad Astronomer&lt;/a&gt;)
and talk about how we can get the real data out there, and tell an even
better&amp;nbsp;story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2012: You Bet Your Asteroid the World Won’t End&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP9535"&gt;9:30am, Monday,
March 12&lt;/a&gt;) will take on the Internet factor in the cause and cure of
2012 hysteria, looking at how urban legends spread, data gets shared,
and myths get debunked online. While we’re at it, we’ll see how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;’s Near Earth Objects office and the amateur astronomy community
keeps an eye on asteroids, comets, and other low-flying space&amp;nbsp;rocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With citizen engagement as a core value, we are highly invested in
empowering space-lovers everywhere to spur exploration. Our goal remains
to see how people will literally change the world with the vision,
inspiration, and engagement of&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The session &lt;strong&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence Space Exploration&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP12424"&gt;12:30pm, Sunday, March 11&lt;/a&gt;) will focuses on “brains as valuable
assets to take over the world.” Learn why people get so passionately
committed to space exploration, how they became connected over the
Internet, and what they’ve created to make “measurable change toward a
more awesome tomorrow.” The grassroots “space tweep” community will
give you strategies about community ownership and empowerment to turn
ideas into&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media strategy at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has grown leaps and bounds since
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/marsphoenix"&gt;@MarsPhoenix&lt;/a&gt; told the story of his long journey to the red planet,
and we are excited to share practical lessons about how we have
integrated a variety of social media platforms across a large
organization and continued to see them grow and&amp;nbsp;mature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Mission Possible: Tweeting Thru Space&lt;/strong&gt;
(&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10789"&gt;5pm, Sunday, March 11&lt;/a&gt;) is all about extending the space
“experience.” We’ll share about tying the social and physical
experience together with events like &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/index.html"&gt;Tweetups&lt;/a&gt;, how to get social
media buy-in across large diverse organizations, how to manage high
volume interactions, and how to keep that momentum going after the big&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community’s commitment to space exploration continues to be deepened
with local education and engagement events like &lt;a href="http://spaceup.org/"&gt;SpaceUp&lt;/a&gt; – and ideas
grow out of these events that could change the way we do outreach. These
nontraditional approaches to outreach will help shape the future of a
changing space&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpacePoints: Space Outreach at Ludicrous Speed&lt;/strong&gt;(&lt;a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10551"&gt;12:30pm, Monday,
March 12&lt;/a&gt;) will feature space-related outreach and engagement
strategies developed from a group of web developers, aerospace
scientists and engineers, and people who dream of living in space.
These “space geeks” are sharing SpacePoints and are increasing
awareness about space policy, increasing funding to aerospace-related
research (commercial and government), and having fun playing to&amp;nbsp;win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why have we come to Austin? We are excited to share our ideas and
experiences, and learn from others who are pushing the envelope, trying
new things, and discovering new frontiers. Ideas are born in places like
#&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;, and it is going to be an amazing week of connecting with others
who are refining technologies, writing policies, and transforming
cultures.  We’re here because we want to talk to you – and we want to&amp;nbsp;listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the banner photo featuring a view of Austin, Texas was taken

industrial and interaction design student &lt;a href="mailto:kljeremk@syr.edu"&gt;Katy Jeremko&lt;/a&gt; to share
about the recent design charrette that Syracuse held in advance of the
&lt;a href="http://rhok.org/space"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt;. This interactive &lt;a href="http://syr.edu/news/articles/2012/space-apps-02-12.html"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;
offered university students an opportunity to dialogue about space data
while helping to shape the proposed challenges and applications of their
solutions. You can follow Katy on Twitter at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/katyjeremko"&gt;@katyjeremko&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we’re children, we see magic everywhere; we like to pick things up,
shake them, ask questions, and share our opinions about them. That sense
of curiosity is what makes childhood so precious and unique to any other
time in our lives. It’s a period in which we tinker without the
restrictions and limitations of the world in which we live today,
fraught with disbelief. However, we look forward to growing up when
we’re young because we see the potential in everything, and we want the
authority to participate in it.   Coming from the perspective of someone
in the in-between of adulthood and childhood, I can safely say that
there are still opportunities for little nuggets of magic despite the
constraints of, “that won’t work” and “don’t do&amp;nbsp;that”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Space Apps Challenges are important because they ignite this
sense of wonder and creativity that has been stifled under the surface
of society.&lt;/strong&gt; This is the first time in a long time that there is a
space being cultivated for a larger philanthropic purpose, stringing
together the beginnings of ideas which will shape our future world.
Everyday we hear about new projects or initiatives going on in the
world, but there’s no concrete platform bridging them together. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
sharing its thoughts and ideas with the world, which is novel to the
standard business model. Learning about the things themselves is shaping
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s reputation. By taking the role as the facilitator of these
challenges, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is going to become the resource we all go to for
bringing ideas to life. These challenges hit on all aspects of
education, visualization, technology, livelihood, and beyond. The world
is shifting towards collaboration, as well as things which are not
removed from the understanding of any one person. It’s all about asking
questions, not knowing, and finding great people who will fill in those
gaps. &lt;strong&gt;It’s giving way to a new, participatory and reflective culture,
erected by the likes of our greatest childhood&amp;nbsp;dreams.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past weekend, Syracuse University students were invited to
participate in a dialogue concerning &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s International Space Apps
Challenge. We took the opportunity to hold a Design Charrette, or
collaborative design thinking session, to gather students from different
practices together to have a discussion on the topics presented. I come
from the background of studying Industrial and Interaction Design, which
is founded on principles of considering systems - how they work, how
they change, and how we react to them. Unlike any other major that I
know of, we are encouraged to pursue a greater understanding of the
relationships between people and things and are not afraid to
collaborate and ideate. &lt;strong&gt;We don’t sit in a lecture hall, we don’t raise
our hands to speak, and we don’t let any idea go untouched. This model
is something that I believe &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is starting to pursue at a greater
capacity than ever before.&lt;/strong&gt; It is the model which is taking the world
by storm, as we’re seeing this through Cloud Computing, Open-Source
frameworks, and social transparency on the web. With a greater number of
pathways for communication, it’s hard to believe that nothing’s&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the generation where I’m going to be figuring out what role I
play in the shifting world. Students like me will look to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as a
resource and facilitator for ideas and concepts, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s name will
become ubiquitous with “making it happen”. More than anything, by
prompting conversation, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is preparing the world for what’s to come
as we continue to develop. We may not see it now, but &lt;strong&gt;we should expect
a new world of innovation, leveraged by the thoughts and participation
of its&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The students share more of their experiences here on&amp;nbsp;video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

and why we do what we do. A few weeks ago, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government team
visited the football stadium at &lt;a href="http://www.rice.edu/"&gt;Rice University&lt;/a&gt; to take some time
out of all the things we are working on to do just that. While sitting
on the 40-yard line, near the spot where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JFK&lt;/span&gt; gave his historic “&lt;em&gt;We
Choose the Moon&lt;/em&gt;” &lt;a href="http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm"&gt;speech&lt;/a&gt;, we collectively took turns re-reading
those historic&amp;nbsp;words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We meet at a college noted for knowledge,
in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, and we
stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and
challenge, in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and
ignorance. The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our
ignorance&amp;nbsp;unfolds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The words struck a chord with us all. The simple exercise of reading
Kennedy&amp;#8217;s speech with a group so committed to changing the world, and
knowing that there really are ways to contribute to that legacy, was&amp;nbsp;sobering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this capsule history of our progress
teaches us anything, it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and
progress, is determined and cannot be deterred. The exploration of space
will go ahead, whether we join in it or not, and it is one of the great
adventures of all time, and no nation which expects to be the leader of
other nations can expect to stay behind in this race for&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That day served as a reminder about why we have all committed our lives
to public service, to advancing space exploration, in pursuit of making
the world a better place - for reasons much bigger then&amp;nbsp;ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We choose to go to the moon in this
decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because
they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the
best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we
are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which
we intend to win, and the others,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JFK&lt;/span&gt; inspired the nation in 1962, which is 50 years ago this September
12th. As we prepare to celebrate the upcoming anniversary, we
intentionally reflected on what his words mean to us today and asked
ourselves some challenging questions. When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JFK&lt;/span&gt; said “We will do these
things not because they are easy but because they are hard” what does
that mean to us? What is the modern corollary? Is it something we are
committed&amp;nbsp;to?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a breathtaking pace, and such a
pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance,
new problems, new dangers. Surely the opening vistas of space promise
high costs and hardships, as well as high&amp;nbsp;reward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this is what Open Government at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is all about. Open
Government is critical to truly fulfilling our Agency’s mission. It’s
more then just embracing the latest technology, or even diligently
working to improve the way we do business inside government. It’s at the
core of everything we do. It’s ultimately about envisioning a future
that is so different than today that you are literally laughed out of
the room when first mentioning it. For this very reason, we often talk
about what the end goal of Open Government looks like amongst friends,
&lt;em&gt;close friends&lt;/em&gt;. But in a moment of full transparency, let me share one
potential future state with you. We truly envision an agency that is
“&lt;em&gt;open by default&lt;/em&gt;.” This applies to everything we do. When we write a
new contract or award a grant, we share the data by default. When we
write new code, it&amp;#8217;s open source by default. When we institute a new
program or project, its participatory by default. When we work, it’s
collaborative by default. Of course there will always be things that an
Agency does that it cannot immediately make “&lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;”, but we believe
these things are much more the exception then the norm at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We set sail on this new sea because there
is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must
be won and used for the progress of all&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that this is very different then the Agency we work at today –
and even talking about being so open, transparency, participatory and
collaborative makes many around us very uneasy. We know that there are
seemingly insurmountable obstacles that must be overcome that require
unlimited patience and persistence. We know that a vision like this sets
us firmly in the minority and that the odds against achieving something
like this not in our favor.  We know that we will always be working too
fast for comfort inside the agency and not fast enough for those on the&amp;nbsp;outside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;exactly&lt;/span&gt; why we
believe what we are doing in terms of Open Government at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
potentially one of the greatest missions the agency has ever&amp;nbsp;undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #008000;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well, space is there, and we&amp;#8217;re going to
climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for
knowledge and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask
God&amp;#8217;s blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest
adventure on which man has ever&amp;nbsp;embarked.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We hope you will consider joining&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Open Gov"></category><category term="Open Source"></category><category term="Opne Data"></category><category term="Rice University"></category><category term="We Choose the Moon"></category></entry><entry><title>Help us Open Source NASA.gov</title><link href="/help-us-open-source-nasa-gov" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-18T19:32:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-18:help-us-open-source-nasa-gov</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The use of open source software, cloud computing technologies, and an
integrated approach to search, video, and social media seems almost
common-place in industry these days. Yet government websites aren’t
quite there with the exception of &lt;a href="http://govfresh.com/2010/02/5-government-sites-using-drupal-effectively-for-open-government-initiatives/"&gt;a few noteable exceptions&lt;/a&gt; (not an
exhaustive list by any means). This is why I’m so excited about that
&lt;a href="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=150041"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has recently released an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Request for Information) for
information on how to build a better public website nasa.gov and
intranet insdie.nasa.gov. This is &lt;em&gt;a really big step&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, but,we
&lt;strong&gt;truly&lt;/strong&gt; need your&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is how it works.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has released an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt; and draft statement
of work. An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt;, or request for information, is a standard government
acquisition process in which vendors submit information that is then
used for comparative purposes to help &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; later release an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFP&lt;/span&gt;, or
request for proposal. An &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt; helps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;nasa.gov is a very high profile website with more around 600,000 unique
visitors and 43 million “hits” per day. The architecture itself is
massive, with roughly 140 disparate websites and web applications and
more total 700,000 web pages across 10 centers. It’s no small job and we
need someone who can help usher us into the future and develop a web
architecture appropriate for an agency like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. This is one of the
greatest jobs on Earth and we are looking to you to&amp;nbsp;help.&lt;/p&gt;

companies and organizations that are visionary, that get open source,
cloud computing, and citizen engagement using the latest online&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s the catch.&lt;/strong&gt; You don’t have much time to respond. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RFI&lt;/span&gt; responses

confidence between government and citizens. One of the objectives of the
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html#framework"&gt;Open Government Initiative at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to help improve the
accessibility to and understanding of the information and data the
Agency releases. One approach to this is to better visualize complicated
datasets, with a particular focus on user engagement. We simply want to
help share the compelling story behind the data we&amp;nbsp;release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our role at the agency, we are fortunate to have access to very
interesting data sets. In November 2011, the Open Government team worked
with members of the &lt;a href="http://www.globalspaceexploration.org/"&gt;International Space Exploration Coordination Group
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISECG&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; to produce an infographic for their &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/03/the-global-exploration-roadmap-interactive-edition/"&gt;Global Exploration
Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;. Since then we have been working with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Office of Chief
Technologist to visualize their recently released &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html"&gt;Space Technology
Roadmap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html"&gt;Space Technology Roadmap&lt;/a&gt; graphically presents the wide range of
technological investments needed to advance the nation&amp;#8217;s space
capabilities. The roadmaps outline in detail the 14 draft Space
Technology Area&amp;#8217;s that were reviewed by the &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13354"&gt;National Research Council
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NRC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; and released in a &lt;a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13354"&gt;final report&lt;/a&gt; on 1 February 2012. The roadmaps define the key new technologies
required for our human and robotic explorers to safely venture into deep
space, to better understand how our own solar system evolved and to
unravel the mysteries of our&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first phase of this project is a graphic that represents the various
technologies &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; needs to develop. The graphic is meant as a starting
point for anyone interested in the what the future of space exploration
might look like. We plan to create a more interactive version of this
infographic that digs deeper into each of the technology&amp;nbsp;areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visualization is the handy work of the talented &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/drbonill/"&gt;Dennis Bonilla&lt;/a&gt;,
Tate Srey, Erin Bonilla, and Matt Scott, who have an unmatched ability
to elegantly display complex data. We&amp;#8217;ve worked with them on previously

make ours a spacefaring civilization.  That&amp;#8217;s why I studied aerospace
engineering in college, worked as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; intern over three summers, take
what I learned as a systems analyst for the intelligence community to
help solve problems for the space program, and now work in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;
National Laboratory&amp;nbsp;Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Space Station is a key step for humanity in our
progression to settling the stars.  Through building the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;, we have
learned how to construct and maintain large, inhabited structures in
space while working on interdisciplinary, international teams.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;

to know to live there&amp;nbsp;safely.&lt;/p&gt;

a &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/471643main_Opportunities_for_Science_on_ISS%20v2.pdf"&gt;unique platform&lt;/a&gt; for scientific research and technology
development.  Nowhere else can we provide a sustained microgravity
environment for long-term research or provide controlled access to the
rarified ionosphere outside.  Some researchers are investigating basic
questions about how materials behave differently without the presence of
gravity.  Others use the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; as a testbed to try out new technologies
that we might use on future missions and see how they hold up when
exposed to&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Station isn’t just reserved for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; research, though. 
Congress designated the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; portion of the Station as a &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/nlab/index.html"&gt;National
Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; to make it more accessible to other government agencies,
academia, and private industry.  For the past three years, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;
National Lab Office has been blazing the trail with these new&amp;nbsp;partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One success story is how we worked with &lt;a href="http://nanoracks.com/"&gt;NanoRacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLC&lt;/span&gt;, to bring
their concept of small, modular experiment modules from concept to
flight in around six months.   The innovative NanoRacks business model
of making the hardware open-source and selling their integration
expertise is leading to &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexknapp/2011/11/21/nanoracks-is-making-space-science-affordable-for-everyone/"&gt;new opportunities&lt;/a&gt; for both science education
and private industrial research that weren’t available even a few years
ago.  NanoRacks is now enhancing the Space Station’s on-board diagnostic
capabilities by modifying a commercial microplate reader to operate in
microgravity.  This will allow researchers to analyze some samples
on-orbit and save the time and expense of waiting for a return&amp;nbsp;flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been fortunate to watch all of this come together in my role as a
strategic relationships manager.  Every six months, I compile the
transportation and on-orbit requirements for all National Lab partners
when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; updates the research plan for all science done on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;. 
I’m also the advocate in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; system for the National Lab partners
assigned to my portfolio, which tends to be commercial and educational&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This role has been the most varied for me, without a doubt.  I’ve
briefed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; managers on why a commercial propulsion experiment could
change the way we build and fly spacecraft.  I compiled on-orbit footage
for Pixar’s &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/shuttle_station/features/buzz_lightyear_dvd.html"&gt;Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs&lt;/a&gt; series.  I’ve helped
negotiate agreements between hardware developers and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Program on
how to prove they can safely fly - without adding additional costs. 
I’ve written white papers for senior &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; management assessing the
benefits and risks of flying new systems on the&amp;nbsp;Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also run the National Lab Twitter ([@ISS_NatLab][])
and &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/ISS-National-Laboratory-Office/158425197505394"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; accounts.  It is vitally important to share what we’re
doing on the Space Station and I’ve found that social media allows us to
connect in special ways.  For Christmas 2010, one of our followers in
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UK&lt;/span&gt; sent us a video question from her daughter asking if Santa Claus
visits the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;.  With the help of our friends in the Air Force and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NORAD&lt;/span&gt;, we were able to give her a window of opportunity to watch the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NORAD&lt;/span&gt; Tracks Santa website.  Sure enough, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NORAD&lt;/span&gt; posted animated video of
Santa and his reindeer making a stop at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has gone even further, though, with its beloved Tweetups.  This is
where we randomly select Twitter followers to come to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; centers and
experience our work first-hand, whether by watching a launch, seeing a
science probe being built, or talking with an astronaut.  I was
fortunate enough to be invited to the Tweetup for the last Space Shuttle
launch, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135, and speak to the attendees about the &lt;a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/ISS%20Science%20Blog/posts/post_1311279690981.html"&gt;awesome
work&lt;/a&gt; we’re doing on the Station.  It was an honor to share the final
flight of a program that shaped the vision of a generation with people
who love &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and impress upon them that the Space Station is carrying
the torch&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The horizon is open for us, if we’re willing to chase it.  Congress and
the President have agreed that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; should continue operating the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;
until at least 2020.  Engineering teams across the agency are hard at
work to ensure that we can keep running the Station as long as it is
safe to do so.  The Center for the Advancement of Science in Space
(&lt;a href="http://www.iss-casis.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CASIS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is poised to take over management of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; National
Laboratory and bring together promising researchers, space hardware
developers, and investors in innovative ways that will expand the use of
the Station for our benefit.  Much of my focus these days is preparing
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CASIS&lt;/span&gt; to take over research planning for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; National&amp;nbsp;Lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a privilege and a pleasure to help get the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; National Lab on
its feet.  I can’t wait to see what the future holds in store.  I
believe that we will continue to expand our presence in the Solar
System, so long as we take advantage of the special foothold in space
that we have orbiting over our heads and provide real benefit to life on
Earth through our work in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t just take my word for it, though.  Go outside on a clear night
when the Space Station is due to pass by and &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/"&gt;see it for yourself&lt;/a&gt;.
 Know that speedy point of light is the size of a football field,
contains a fully-functional research laboratory, is home to six people,
and represents everything great we can accomplish when we work together.
 If that doesn&amp;#8217;t get you excited and proud of our country and our
species, I don&amp;#8217;t know what will.&amp;nbsp;=)&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="collaboration"></category><category term="Education"></category><category term="engineering"></category><category term="I am NASA"></category><category term="Inspiration"></category><category term="ISS"></category><category term="NASA"></category><category term="Science"></category></entry><entry><title>code.NASA at one month old</title><link href="/code-nasa-at-one-month-old" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2012-02-06T08:33:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2012-02-06:code-nasa-at-one-month-old</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/what_does_nasa_do.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s primary objectives&lt;/a&gt; has always been to share its
research and discoveries with the world. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s success as an agency
depends not only on the outcome of our missions, but more importantly,
on how effectively we can engage the public in our mission and enable
others to leverage the agencies discoveries and scientific advances to
improve the standard of living for the average person and encourage
economic growth. This is why &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/open-source-development.html"&gt;Open Source Development&lt;/a&gt; is a
cornerstone of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government&amp;nbsp;Plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was an early adopter of open source and has been using and
releasing code for years in order to address project and mission needs,
accelerate software development and maximize public awareness and impact
of research. However, there was never a central repository for the code;
someone looking for software needed to visit desperate field
center-specific websites, many of which did not offer version control.
To unify the agencies open source activities under one umbrella, the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government team &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/01/04/the-plan-for-code/"&gt;launched code.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; one month ago. The site
is an easy to use directory of open source software released by the
agency and will serve the purpose of publicly surfacing existing
projects, providing a forum for discussing projects and processes, and
guiding internal and external groups in open development, release, and&amp;nbsp;contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Code.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has generated a lot of media attention since its launch with
over 76,000 visitors and 140,000 page views, dozens of news articles,
top-rated stories on Reddit and Slashdot, tens of thousands of hits to
the site, and great feedback on Twitter, Facebook, and Google+. It’s
clear that people are genuinely excited about the opportunity to
contribute to the space program through software development. Still,
there are incredible challenges in fulfilling our open source goals.
Since 2003, the agency has released more than 60 software projects under
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOSA&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Source Agreement], but many of these packages are
not hosted on a public repository and are virtually inaccessible to the
public. As an agency, we are just now starting to release software under
other (more popular) licenses and truly embrace the potential of open
source software&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve been continually adding new projects to the site since it’s launch
and now feature 29 projects from around the agency, ranging from
frameworks for satellite flight software to solar physics libraries to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSH&lt;/span&gt;-based load balancing. To be listed on the site, the software must
not only be released under an open source license, but also make the
code available on a public repository. We’ve created the &lt;a href="http://github.com/nasa"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; github&lt;/a&gt;
account to host any code that doesn’t have a public home elsewhere. We
are adding new projects daily and encourage you to help us uncover more.
The latest projects were sent to us by &lt;a href="http://us.apachecon.com/c/acna2010/speakers/502"&gt;Chris Mattman&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Jet

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Open Government Plan&lt;/a&gt; lays out an ambitious vision for the
future of open source development at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Code.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is a step in the
right direction and we continue to work to establish the processes,
policies, and culture needed so that non-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; developers will be able to
contribute to on-going &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; projects in real-time. We encourage you to
visit code.nasa.gov and check out our code. &lt;strong&gt;Fork it, clone it, break

TEDGlobal 2011, asking two vital questions: &lt;strong&gt;How can we use this
orbital research facility to improve life on Earth? How can we use the
orbital perspective to inspire people to make a&amp;nbsp;difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/26440850?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;color=ffffff" frameborder="0" width="400" height="225"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/26440850"&gt;The orbital perspective: Ron Garan from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/tedtalks"&gt;TEDTalks&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com"&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron talks about conducting a spacewalk, 30 meters above the
International Space Station, and explains that “&lt;em&gt;we can look down&lt;/em&gt;from
our orbital perspective &lt;em&gt;and realize that each one of us is riding
through the Universe together on this spaceship we call Earth, that we
are all interconnected, that we are all in this together, that we are
all&amp;nbsp;family.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Ron Garan on EVA" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/ron-eva-300x199.jpg" title="Ron Garan on EVA" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He proceeded to share some of the lessons learned from the international
collaboration that created the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; and enable crewmembers to live and
work there on a long-term basis. The audience could also see much of the
incredible &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/index.html"&gt;science research&lt;/a&gt; that is happening on the Station and
what kinds of solutions it could mean on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can land on the Moon, if we can build something like the space
station, &lt;strong&gt;what more could we really make&amp;nbsp;possible?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/i8WTPOYqTzU" frameborder="0" width="560" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TedxVienna-Ron-Garan-The-Orbita"&gt;Ideas continued to spread&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/"&gt;networks continued to grow&lt;/a&gt;.
Powerful ideas can spur world-changing initiatives, and it was quickly
apparent that there are multiple organizations all over the world
looking to develop truly effective collaboration platforms. It is
critical to unify those&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The key challenge is demonstrating how vital and valuable
collaboration truly is&lt;/strong&gt;, despite the real and perceived risks.
Data-based collaborations make solutions &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; through the pooling of
resources and information. Working together multiplies
cost-effectiveness while reducing duplication of effort. It is the only
way to enable economies – and solutions – of scale. Perhaps most
importantly, collaboration encourages greater accountability and fosters
trust. We are all interconnected, and the only way we’ll solve this is&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weekend, from &lt;a href="http://www.tedxsalford.com/"&gt;TEDxSalford&lt;/a&gt;, Ron is announcing the launch of an
international effort to connect humanity’s change makers to the
challenges of our planet – and to each other – through a universal, opn
source platform that will help achieve our common goals. (You can watch
the presentations live &lt;a href="http://www.tedxsalford.com/live"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, January&amp;nbsp;28.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We are calling the mechanism that we will build the Unity Node.&lt;/strong&gt; The
first node of the International Space Station – also known as Unity -
was launched to be the central connector of all the other modules. The
name illustrates how the space program has inspired our vision for
collaboration. The orbital perspective that we have as we look back upon
our Earth from space allows us to intimately experience our
interconnectedness, while the example of international collaboration
that constructed the incredible orbiting research facility demonstrates
that by working together we can accomplish&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unity Node will be a &lt;strong&gt;connector&lt;/strong&gt;. There are two pieces to this
connection: a central data tool and outward facing apps that make that
data useful and accessible. Just as the Unity Node on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; connects
the modules together and contains the lines and cables that provide for
life, this Unity Node will connect the various organizations and efforts
with resource and communication lifelines, creating a platform for
changing the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real Unity Node story, though, is the collaboration – not the tool
or the technology. &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; are the ones who affect change. The standard
of success will be effective collaboration that enables consistent,
sustainable world&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is &lt;strong&gt;what kind of world do you want&lt;/strong&gt;? And what can you do
– big or small - to help it become that&amp;nbsp;way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="what kind of world" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/what-kind-of-world-300x225.jpg" title="what kind of world" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don’t have to be in orbit to have the orbital perspective, and you
don’t have to accept things the way they are&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="http://unitynode.org/"&gt;Unity Node&lt;/a&gt; is
invested in reducing that sobering contradiction that we see when we
look down at our world. Now is the time to improve life on Earth so that

&lt;p&gt;Garan spent 164 days in space during the Expedition 27 and Expedition 28
missions to the International Space Station. He and his crewmates
launched April 4, 2011, and returned to Earth on Sept. 15, 2011. While
aboard the station, the crew continued work on a variety of microgravity
experiments and received provisions from two shuttle missions, including
the last space shuttle visit to the station. Garan participated in the
last space-shuttle-based spacewalk during the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his time in space, Garan shared his experiences and images he

I enter the classroom about ten minutes before my scheduled start time.
 As I go through the motions of signing on to the computer, opening my
presentation and setting out my materials I think through the upcoming
class.  I’ve taught this material many times before, so I’m not worried.
 I finish getting things in place and settle into a chair as I wait for
my student.  Soon, she walks through the door, sets her backpack down,
puts away her phone and looks up.

“Hi!” I say.  “I’m Kristen and I’ll be your instructor today.  I
understand this is one of your last classes before you leave the
country.  How has the training been so far?  Are you feeling ready to
launch?”**  
**

Yes, launch.  You see, my students aren’t your everyday students.  They
are the men and women that will fly on spacecraft and live on the
International Space Station for months at a time.  They come from all
different countries and all different backgrounds.

Today, I will teach about the thermal system on the Station; radiators,
coolant fluid lines that run through the modules, software that keeps
the system running.  My crew-member and I will go step by step through
the system, ensuring they understand terminology and can work through a
procedure.  I expect that when we leave at the end of the day my student
will be able to fix the system on board if they were ever needed to do
so.

Tomorrow, I will be running a mission simulation to train new flight
controllers.  In the simulation I will “break” something and listen and
evaluate how the flight controller responds, but I won’t step in and
actively teach - not then.

The motivations of my students from day to day are incredibly different.
 An astronaut will spend about two years in training prior to launching
to the space station.  They will learn something about every system on
board, every experiment they will be running and different languages
they will need to speak while they are the prime crew.  A flight
controller will spend a year or more learning everything about just one
or maybe two systems on board the Space Station.  They will rely on
others for information about everything else, but they will provide the
on-board crew with support as they are needed.  And yet, I teach them
all.  In the end, everyone needs to understand a lot of the same
material, but for very different reasons.

Though I teach, I also work with these people on a day to day basis.  I
see them in the hallways and I support them in many training scenarios.
 They are not astronauts or flight controllers to me, but they are
friends, family.  Every time a vehicle launches I feel my nerves and I
hope for a smooth mission.  I think about my personal interactions with
these people and I trust in the flight controllers that are keeping the
space station safe in orbit.  I know that we all work in a risky
business, but we do everything possible to keep our crew safe.

When a crew returns I may see them in the hallway.  I will smile, give
them a hug and ask how they’ve been.  “I haven’t seen you since you
returned!  How was it?”  My friend tells me just how small the earth
looks from space and about their new perspective on the world.  I know,
in that moment, that the years of classes and simulations were worth it
for them, and knowing that is fulfilling to me.  The conversation closes
and I head to my next class.  I’m teaching to a student just selected to
the astronaut corps.  Their class with me is such a small part of their
journey, and yet, it is still a part of it; for that, I am proud.

most information-rich technology agencies in the nation?  Deputy Chief
Information Officer Deborah Diaz &lt;a href="http://fedscoop.com/radio/open-government-mobile-and-google-with-nasa-deputy-cio-deborah-diaz/"&gt;talked with FedScoop Radio&lt;/a&gt; about
exactly that, and the future for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; looks as bright as a million
flickering network&amp;nbsp;routers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Diaz is certainly excited about the future of &lt;a href="http://code.nasa.gov"&gt;code.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/01/04/the-plan-for-code/" title="The Plan for Code"&gt;as
are we!&lt;/a&gt;) [at -10:45 on the audio stream], but expands on some of the
other hot topics in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Information Technology community, such as the
&amp;#8220;Bring Your Own Device&amp;#8221; concept [-10:30] and how consumer-driven &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;
[-10:05] is driving practices in government and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in&amp;nbsp;particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/appschallenge/"&gt;International Space Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; [-9:00] is fast approaching,
and &lt;a href="http://fedscoopradio.com"&gt;FedScoop&lt;/a&gt; reporter &lt;a href="http://fedscoop.com/radio/tag/david-stegon/"&gt;David Stegon&lt;/a&gt; discussed this and other
examples of trends [-8:00] that exist in the government space.  Among
these trends is rethinking how we collaborate [-7:00], and extreme
collaboration tools tailored to the end-user [-6:15].  These are things
that employees at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; look to the Office of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt; to enable.  A
timely mention of technologies available at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CES&lt;/span&gt; last year [-5:50] gives
some hope to what may emerge this week, especially in the areas of data
storage and cloud utilization&amp;nbsp;[-5:15].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big on everyone&amp;#8217;s mind lately is the emergence of Google+ into the
social media playing field, and the two discuss [-3:37] some of the
incredible analytics coming out of &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/14/nasa-on-google/" title="+NASA on Google+"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s presence on G+&lt;/a&gt; and the
other top platforms of&amp;nbsp;2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing, Ms. Diaz stresses the human element:  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; wants you to be
involved in our future&lt;/strong&gt;.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OCIO&lt;/span&gt; is committed to investigating ways

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; web family. Through this website, we will continue, unify, and
expand &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open source activities. The site will serve to surface
existing projects, provide a forum for discussing projects and
processes, and guide internal and external groups in open development,
release, and&amp;nbsp;contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our initial release, we are focusing on providing a home for the
current state of open source at the Agency. This includes guidance on
how to engage the open source process, points of contact, and a
directory of existing projects. By elucidating the process, we hope to
lower the barriers to building open technology in partnership with the&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase two will concentrate on providing a robust forum for ongoing
discussion of open source concepts, policies, and projects at the
Agency. In our third phase, we will turn to the tools and mechanisms
development projects generally need to be successful, such as
distributed version control, issue tracking, continuous integration,
documentation, communication, and planning/management. During this
phase, we will create and host a tool, service, and process chain to
further lower the burden to going&amp;nbsp;open.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, our goal is to create a highly visible community hub that
will imbue open concepts into the formulation stages of new hardware and
software projects, and help existing projects transition to open modes
of development and operation. We are going to need your help to get
there! Please use “Share your Ideas,” comment on this post, or email us
at op&lt;span style="display: none;"&gt;No spam, please.&lt;/span&gt;engov@nasa.gov
to let us know how code can help you, where you would like to see the
site go, and how we might best fulfill our&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that tomorrow’s space and science systems will be built in
the open, and that code.nasa.gov will play a big part in getting us
there. Will your code someday &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch6-2.html"&gt;escape our solar system&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html"&gt;land on an

program in very real ways. The collective genius enabled by open source
emboldens us and helps us reach new heights, whether they be in &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/dec/HQ_11-413_SpaceX_ISS_Flight.html"&gt;low

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/09/08/open-source-development-at-nasa/"&gt;As we have mentioned before&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has been working on open source
for some time. To continue, encourage, and highlight open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
projects, the Open Government team today is pleased to announce &lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
presence on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, the web-based social code host and revision
control application. Our &lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa/World-Wind-Java"&gt;first public repository&lt;/a&gt; houses &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
popular World Wind Java project, an open source 3D interactive world
viewer. In addition, we are actively reaching out to other open source
software projects within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and encouraging them to make use of this
and similar resources. We hope that highly visible and coordinated
hosting of projects will stimulate development and&amp;nbsp;awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

exploration. I watched every space movie I could find, and carried
around a well-worn copy of the Space Shuttle Operators Manual in one
hand and my astronaut doll in the other. My elementary school classes
crowded around the television to watch each launch, and those brave
orange-suited astronauts were the first to teach me about hard work,
adventure, and&amp;nbsp;courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I confess that somehow the space station has never quite captured my
heart in the same way. I’ve never watched it launch; I’ve never touched
its tiles or seen it fly. Long minutes on the front lawn, squinting at
the sky, looking for streaks of light across the horizon – it’s hard to
connect that to eleven years of continuous human presence in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing I’m learning: my exploration dreams have to grow
up. The lessons of the International Space Station are different than
those of the shuttle – and vital in a whole new&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The station teaches me that it takes time to build a real future in
space.&lt;/strong&gt; We started talking about a space station in the early 80s, and
launched the first node in the late 90s. More than ten years later, we
still have a few modules to go. We’re in this thing for the long&amp;nbsp;haul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The station teaches me that experience builds capacity.&lt;/strong&gt; The more we
live and work in space, the more skill and expertise we are gaining to
enable us to accomplish our future – whether the Moon, Mars, or
somewhere beyond. Living in space isn’t the same as visiting&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The station teaches me that science is really what changes things.&lt;/strong&gt;
Exploration is awesome and noble and romantic – and our chief goal must
remain to explore the unknown. But the reality is that &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ErLtE3Lf9s"&gt;science enables
us to make sense of what we find there&lt;/a&gt; – and put it to good&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The station teaches me that together, we can do anything.&lt;/strong&gt; If we can
surmount budget crises and bureaucracies and international relations to
do something as amazing as this – in the harsh and unforgiving vacuum of
space – then how could we not do the same thing on&amp;nbsp;earth?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still frequently wear a sterling silver space shuttle around my neck;
somehow I imagine that it will always be my first love. The shuttle
taught me about humans going to space. The station teaches me about
space coming to humans on earth – not just for a handful of crewmembers
- but for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we tell that story? How do we get the public to connect to the
space station the same way that millions flocked to watch shuttle
launches? Most importantly, how do we engage the world in the kind of
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/12/01/the-collaboration-project/"&gt;international collaboration&lt;/a&gt; that built the space station and makes
the future&amp;nbsp;possible?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are creating amazing open source citizen science projects like
the &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/natronics/status/135819832867299328"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; globe&lt;/a&gt;  and the &lt;a href="http://gizmodo.com/5811126/iss-lamp-illuminates-when-the-space-station-is-near"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;light.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can follow live &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html"&gt;station tracking&lt;/a&gt; and find &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html"&gt;sightings&lt;/a&gt; near you
and interact with the station crew both #FromSpace and #FromEarth via
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nasa_astronauts"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/116214152295449083654/posts"&gt;Google+&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8230; or even &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ix7ak/iama_son_of_nasa_astronaut_mike_fossum_who_is/"&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can explore the inside of the station and mission control on &lt;a href="http://spacestationlive.jsc.nasa.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;
Live!&lt;/a&gt; - and in the future you will be able to grab live station
telemetry via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can watch (probably over and over, like I have) this &lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/32430473"&gt;amazing
time-lapse view&lt;/a&gt; of the trip around the globe and back to&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#8217;s what encourages me the most: there are &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/115200104175185451947/posts/TioAfWGBGgf"&gt;so&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/liz-warren-nasa-scientist.html"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; who
are &lt;a href="http://www.opennasa.com/2010/05/26/tell-me-a-story/#more-1799"&gt;telling this story&lt;/a&gt;. Our flight doctors - with incredible
expertise in telemedicine to long-term remote, closed environments -
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/news/chile_assistance.html"&gt;took that experience to Chile&lt;/a&gt; to help rescue the trapped miners. We
are using the lessons of long-duration spaceflight to make &lt;a href="http://www.henryford.com/body.cfm?id=56625"&gt;ultrasound
technology&lt;/a&gt; available in places that need it most. The &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2011/07/14/the-orbital-perspective-ron-garan-from-the-iss/"&gt;orbital
perspective&lt;/a&gt; is inspiring &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/projects/"&gt;humanitarian projects&lt;/a&gt; all over the world
to help preserve our fragile oasis. Even kids are &lt;a href="http://youtu.be/_bVHSrDBZEU"&gt;getting inspired&lt;/a&gt;
to &lt;a href="http://trainlikeanastronaut.org/"&gt;train like an astronaut&lt;/a&gt;- working together to get stronger and

media and with concrete ideas of how social media tools can improve
space operations, space exploration, space science, and Earth
observations from space &amp;#8212; your ideas could shape the future of the
global space program! As such, it is time to socialize your experience
and ideas with space leaders in government, industry and academia at the
International Astronautical Congress in Naples, Italy, 1-5 October&amp;nbsp;2012!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting opportunity for students and young professionals to
participate in a plenary at the International Astronautical Congress in
Naples, Italy next October! The Next Generations Plenary Event will
focus on the Uses of Social Media for the Advancement of Earth and Space
Science, Technology and Operations. This is the third year in which the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt; will have a plenary with students and young professionals as&amp;nbsp;panelists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are proposing to organize a plenary event to hear concrete ideas from
21-35 year olds on how social media and citizen science can be used
presently and in the future to enhance space missions and technology. If
approved, this event would take place the week of 1-5 October 2012 in
Naples, Italy, at the International Astronautical Congress (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt;).
Plenary event participants will engage in a panel discussion and
interact with the audience while sharing their ideas on the myriad of
benefits that social networking tools offer space endeavors. The plenary
will be moderated in a talk show fashion interweaving clips from the
panelists’ audition videos with questions and comments from the
moderator, other panelists, and the audience. The video clips will be
used to enhance the audience’s understanding of the ideas of the plenary
participants. This is an exciting opportunity that you do not want to&amp;nbsp;miss!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested, the deadline is approaching fast, so here is what
you have to&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ROUND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt;: 15 Seconds of&amp;nbsp;Fame!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 21 December 2011, create a 15 second video telling us why you should
be chosen to address the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt; and post it on [ http://www.youtube.com][].
 We will only watch/listen for 15 seconds, so be sure to watch the time
of your video! Then complete the application at 
&lt;a href="http://surveyor3.org/survey.php?id=X3MEUE94"&gt;http://surveyor3.org/survey.php?id=&lt;span class="caps"&gt;X3MEUE94&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAF&lt;/span&gt; will select the Round Two subset of candidates from the above
and notify all entrants by 9 January 2012. Specific details of Round Two
requirements will be sent to the candidates in the notification.
Selected candidates will be asked to create and post a three minute
video on YouTube by 31 January&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FINAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SELECTION&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAF&lt;/span&gt; will select the finalists from these entries based on their
creativity, efficacy of messages and relevance to the plenary topics. We
will be looking for concrete ideas on how social media and citizen
science can advance space operations, space exploration, space science,
and Earth observations from space. All entrants will be notified of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAF&lt;/span&gt;’s decision on their applications by 15 February 2012.&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAF&lt;/span&gt; will make the final selection of Plenaries for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt; in
Naples the week of 12 March 2012 and will notify the finalists of its
decision by 31 March&amp;nbsp;2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who Will Sponsor Me to Travel to&amp;nbsp;Naples?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plenary participants will be responsible for finding a sponsor or
sponsors for their travel to and accommodations at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt;. In addition
to the obvious sources of sponsorship – your employer or school, and
industry contacts - we want to share some great programs with you that
occur in conjunction with the 2012 Naples &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IAC&lt;/span&gt; for students and young

Microsoft, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, Yahoo and Worldbank. With this weekend’s events, RHoK has
now reached a total 99 hackathons worldwide and has engaged nearly 6,000
technologists, designers and citizens in its events! Cities joining RHoK
for the first time included Banjul in the Gambia; Pretoria, South
Africa; Antwerp, Belgium; Rosario, Argentina; Warsaw, Poland; London and
Oxford in the U.K., Montreal and Hamilton in Canada and Austin,
Milwaukee, Manchester, Princeton and Portland in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government team was active a number of locations and
blogged throughout the weekend about the many solutions developed. We
also teamed up with Astronaut Ron Garan and others to to host a
challenge called the &amp;#8220;Collaboration Project&amp;#8221; which challenged the
community to build a robust, user-friendly database and visualization of
collaboration projects worldwide that is easily accessed with all
metadata. There are an estimated 20 million governments, NGOs and aid
organizations aimed at making the world a better&amp;nbsp;place.&lt;/p&gt;

together subject matter experts with volunteer technologists to develop
open technology solutions to the global challenges. Collaborative teams
came together at more than 30 sites around the world to “hack for
humanity.” More than anything, RHoK is a glorious experiment in focus
and fast collaboration. What can you do with a roomful of
highly-skilled, highly-focused developers committed to make the world a
better&amp;nbsp;place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pretty much&amp;nbsp;anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, though, that while I love RHoK – I’m not a
developer, not able to code, have no technical skills when it comes to
software (other than the user experience!) I invite all my (also
non-coder) friends and colleagues to come and work with us at RHoK and
their answer is pretty inevitably &amp;#8220;but I&amp;#8217;m not a&amp;nbsp;hacker&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tell them that we&amp;#8217;re all hackers - all it means is to take a unique
and unconventional approach to a problem, using what you have to make it
work. Usually I start talking about the Apollo 13 movie, which almost of
all them have seen.&lt;em&gt;Do you remember when we had problems on the
spacecraft? And the flight controllers brought in a pile of random stuff
that we had available in the capsule, and said &amp;#8220;you have to figure out
how to make&lt;/em&gt;this&lt;em&gt;fit into&lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt;using just&lt;/em&gt;this&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s hacking. And &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is amazing at it - which is part of why we
believe that the work that happens at RHoK is so&amp;nbsp;valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how does RHoK engage a larger community than just developers? Here&amp;#8217;s
how to hack if you aren&amp;#8217;t a&amp;nbsp;hacker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Meet people!&lt;/strong&gt; The conversations and ideas that happen at RHoK are
every bit as important as the products produced. Go around and ask
people their stories. Find out what they do and why. You will come out
with new ideas and new&amp;nbsp;potentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Be a good listener, and think about what experiences you have that
could apply to the approach to the problem.&lt;/strong&gt; Our center director at the
Johnson Space Center, a former astronaut, often talks about how valuable
it was when engineers, scientists, educators, and others joined the
fighter pilots in the astronaut corps. Different backgrounds and
approaches allowed them to solve problems more quickly and more
effectively. The same is true at&amp;nbsp;RHoK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Help organize, connect, and keep the team together.&lt;/strong&gt; RHoK is short,
and there is a lot to be done. Projects need names, partners, plans.
Help chunk out tasks and get them organized somewhere. Tell the story of
the problem – and the solution. Help document the process – it’s vital
to giving the project a&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;• &lt;strong&gt;Do research.&lt;/strong&gt; Every project needs a ton of research, constant
searching of what is out there, what the needs are, how the data is
structured. Look around. Read, learn, get more info. I guarantee you
that your project will come out better for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; at RHoK. Developers come and build products – but
project managers and engineers and ideas people and marketing types and
technologists, they give the products a&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Education Stakeholder’s Summit in Chantilly, Virginia to talk about
future education initiatives and workforce development.  I was invited
by the organizers to share a few thoughts on how to effectively
communicate with the next generation. I’ve included the presentation
below but also provided a summary with more context.  Not everything in
the presentation is covered because otherwise this post would be even
longer then it already is, so if you have questions please feel free to
contact&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;script src="http://speakerdeck.com/embed/4edb06faaabc6c004d003a67.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On&amp;nbsp;Generations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historians &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strauss_and_Howe"&gt;Neil Howe and William Strauss&lt;/a&gt; have constructed a great
way of looking at generations.  In their book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generations_(book)"&gt;Generations: The
History of America&amp;#8217;s Future, 1584 to 2069&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;published in 1991, they
describe a four generational archetypes that repeat throughout
Anglo-American history over the past 500 years with only one exception.
The theory is very useful tool for anyone who is looking to better
understand the younger generations and their&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Strauss and Howe explain, “&lt;em&gt;your generation isn’t like the generation
that shaped you, but it has much in common with the generation that
shaped the generation that shaped you&lt;/em&gt;.” For example, Boomers (whose
strength is individualism, culture and values) raised Millennial (Gen Y)
children (whose strength is in collective civic action).  The theory
helps us understand the interaction between generations.  As Boomers
replace the Silent as elder leaders, they reject caution and compromise
and act on moral absolutes. As Gen X replaces Boomers in midlife, they
will apply a new pragmatic survivalism to management decisions. As
Millennials replaces Gen X in young adulthood, they will revitalize
community, social discipline, and public&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what about the generation after the Millennials? Who are&amp;nbsp;they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss and Howe originally called this next generation the “&lt;em&gt;Silent
Echo&lt;/em&gt;” generation because history suggests that they will most resemble
the Silent Generation that came before the Boomers (they now refer to
them as the Homeland Generation).  Personally, I like to refer to them
as “true digital natives” given they are the first generation to come of
age fully immersed in digital technology. Strauss and Howe define the
next generation as people who were born at the turn of the century, but
the dates are not certain when it comes to this work, and I’d argue that
this generation really started in 1996.  Why this is so important is
that the first wave of true digital natives – people who were born after
the invention of the internet and have been immersed in digital
technology their entire lives – are now 16 years old.  They may already
be applying to your High School internship programs and will be entering
college and the workforce in the next couple of&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the theory, true digital natives are people who were born
during a time when great danger and crisis cut down social and political
complexity in favor of public consensus, aggressive, institutions, and
an ethic of personal sacrifice.  That sure sounds a lot like the world
students are experiencing today.  If history is any indicator of the
future, this will be a generation that grows up overprotected by adults
preoccupied with the crisis, come of age as the socialized and
conformist young adults of a post-crisis world, break out as
process-oriented midlife leaders during an awakening, age into
thoughtful post-awakening elders, and be remembered for their quite
years of rising adulthood and midlife years of flexible,
consensus-building&amp;nbsp;leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main message of the talk at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Education Stakeholder’s Summit
was to raise awareness of the true digital native generation &lt;em&gt;– the one
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFTER&lt;/span&gt; Generation Y&lt;/em&gt;.  Of course, the whole idea of a “generation” is
really an over simplification.  Although useful to describe a group of
people who share a common place in time and who have experienced similar
formative events, it doesn’t describe everybody.  Generational boundary
lines are hard to define and often blur into each other. I know many
“Digital Natives” who acknowledge they are simply stuck in a “Baby
Boomer” body and can run circles around their younger counterparts.  
However, the simplification is a useful place to start when talking
about how to communicate effectively to a broad audience and is
particularly relevant in terms of educational initiatives focused at
engaging a younger&amp;nbsp;generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Reach Digital&amp;nbsp;Natives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk highlighted 7 tips, based on some fundamental truths, that will
help you engage the true digital native generation in your
organization’s&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7.  &lt;strong&gt;Understand the audience&lt;/strong&gt;– Even though they have a lot in common,
the next generation is not Generation Y.  This is a generation that is
growing up in a time when the individualism, risk-taking, and
conspicuous consumption of the previous generations is winding down. 
The environment they know is one of a new sobriety fueled by unpaid
debts and unmet challenges, both home and abroad.  Unfairly or not, this
generation will deal head on with a crisis they inherited from others
before them.  What will their formative events during their childhood
be?  How will it shape them?  What role does technology play in it&amp;nbsp;all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6.  &lt;strong&gt;Listen to the conversation –&lt;/strong&gt; If “forty-five percent of time
spent communicating is listening” and “seventy-five percent of
communication is non-verbal,&amp;#8221; the next step may simply be to pause and
listen to the conversation.  What communities are they a part of? How do
they use the channels? When do they use the channels?  You can’t
communicate if you are not part of the conversation, and you won’t be
invited back to the conversation if you never take time to listen to
what is being&amp;nbsp;discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5.  &lt;strong&gt;Challenge the norms&lt;/strong&gt; - While the web is all about authentic,
transparent, and participatory conversations that enables the viral
spread of your content, industrial age organizations such as government
are often driven by a hierarchical culture of fear that leads to tight
control of messages and public image.  We often respond to request to
participate in a conversation with a statement like “no comment goes
online without our explicit approval.”  That approach won’t make you
many friends in the digital age.  Real engagement is when people do
things for you that you didn‘t ask them to. Learn to lose control – in
return for greater&amp;nbsp;reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4.  &lt;strong&gt;Embrace technology&lt;/strong&gt; - Government agencies tend to use a «pull»
mentality – building destination sites in the belief that people will
find them and stay if they‘re interested.  We think that the best use of
our resources would be to duplicate an already existing online platform
in the name of security, protection, or efficiency.  Why compete with
someone else who is doing what you are trying to do a million times
better?  Instead, unleash the community that is already out there by
becoming a hub, that incentivizes anyone to share relevant information,
and then aggregates and pushes out the best channel on all available
channels to the broadest audience&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;strong&gt;.  Be interesting and unique&lt;/strong&gt;.  Once you make the plunge and join
the conversation, strive to be interesting and unique.  With so many
conversations going on at once, and so many different communication
channels connecting diverse communities, a good way to fail quickly is
to offer boring, static content with no personality.  Simply feeding an
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSS&lt;/span&gt; feed into a Twitter account isn’t good enough.  Instead of trying to
influence your audience, inspire them.  Share a personal, compelling
story about your organization and create an opportunity to include the
audience in the&amp;nbsp;adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2.  &lt;strong&gt;Create real opportunities to participate&lt;/strong&gt;– People want to
participate.  They want to fly in space themselves, they want to drive
the Mars Rover, they want to be part of the design process.  Technology
enables this more then ever before so create opportunities to engage
citizens in your organizations mission.  People get behind something
they helped&amp;nbsp;build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;strong&gt;.  Think 10 years ahead&lt;/strong&gt; - The way we do business, the way we
communicate and the way we work, will all change dramatically in the
next 10 years (maybe sooner).  Think ahead.  Envision the future. 
Create environments for your employees that they will flock to.  If you
are serious about focusing on engaging the next generation, stop
thinking about how we do things today. How do people use technology when
computers are simply cheap, portable browsers and connectivity is not
longer an issue? How do people communicate when email is no longer used?
How do people collaborate when everything is stored online and
organizations no longer &amp;#8220;own&amp;#8221; their&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is changing fast and you simply can’t afford not to. As an
organization, as a leader, and as a mentor to the next generation, be
intentional about creating opportunities for them to participate. 
Effectively communicating is an essential first step.  Be a government
in beta. One that takes appropriate risks, that challenges the status
quo, and that is excited about creating a future we can’t even imagine
is possible.  That’s the type of organization people are attracted&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>RHoK-ing it out with NASA Data</title><link href="/rhok-ing-it-out-with-nasa-data" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-12-02T02:54:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Sean Herron</name></author><id>tag:,2011-12-02:rhok-ing-it-out-with-nasa-data</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This weekend, 34 cities across the globe will play host to [Random Hacks
of Kindness #4][]. Random Hacks of Kindness is a community of
innovation that brings together subject matter experts with volunteer
technologists to develop open technology solutions to the global
challenges. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a long history with RHoK - we were one of the
founding core team members and have been involved ever&amp;nbsp;since!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the projects worked on at RHoK rely on critical data about earth
in order to accomplish their goals (such as rainfall analysis,
temperature readings, imagery, etc). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s earth science missions
collect terabytes upon terabytes per day of information about our
planet, and we&amp;#8217;ve made it our goal to help RHoK-ers as much as possible
with accessing our data and using it in amazing ways to create apps that
save lives. Here are just a few ways we&amp;#8217;re working with RHoK this year
to make our data&amp;nbsp;accessible:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) data.nasa.gov&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;http://data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We launched data.nasa.gov earlier this year to act as &amp;#8220;yellow pages&amp;#8221; of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; datasets. Since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s data is so distributed across the internet,
it&amp;#8217;s traditionally been incredibly difficult to find the data you needed
unless you knew what you were looking for. data.nasa.gov aims to make
the process of discovering data easier by offering a simple, tagged
index of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data resources. If you&amp;#8217;re really ambitious, you can even
use our &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to query the&amp;nbsp;site!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Meet us in person!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All five members of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Open Government Team will be on call and
present at different RHoK locations around the country. We&amp;#8217;ll work to
make ourselves known at the events - feel free to come up to ask
questions, get ideas, or just chat about space! If we can&amp;#8217;t answer
something, we&amp;#8217;ll work to find a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; expert who&amp;nbsp;can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Tag up with us online&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll all also be available online to help out those RHoK locations
without a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-rep, or to help facilitate cross-RHoK event
collaborations. See below for a list of where we&amp;#8217;ll be and how to
contact&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) Join &amp;#8220;The Collaboration Project&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/12/01/the-collaboration-project/"&gt;http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/12/01/the-collaboration-project/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The goal of this collaboration is to bring together different
perspectives to create one, simple, user-friendly mechanism to
communicate and collaborate to tackle the challenges facing our world.
By doing that we can all learn from each others’ successes and mistakes.
&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/astro_ron"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Astronaut Ron Garan&lt;/a&gt; is spearheading this effort, and will be
presenting on it at RHoK Austin Saturday morning. We&amp;#8217;ll update this post
with a recording as soon as his talk takes&amp;nbsp;place!&lt;/p&gt;

amazing way &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is partnering with innovators and world-changers to
take the perspective, insight, and technology we have from space and
make the world a better, safer, more beautiful&amp;nbsp;place. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TgoxQDVKRIY" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years of human history, the vast majority of people in
the world believed that it was impossible to fly to the Moon - simply
because it had never been done before. Up until about 50 years ago
people would have thought you were crazy to suggest we could go to the
Moon, but human ingenuity and the determination of the human spirit
proved that it was possible. Today, many people believe that it is
impossible to solve the problems of the world. It is widely believed
that is impossible to lift the poor out of poverty. ‘There have always
been poor in the world and there always will be,’ they say. If we can
land on the Moon and return to Earth safely, if nations can join
together and build an enormous research facility in orbit, we can, by
working together, solve many of the challenges facing our planet
including the alleviation of poverty. &lt;strong&gt;Nothing is&amp;nbsp;impossible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we look at the Earth from space we are faced with a sobering
contradiction. On one hand, we can clearly see the indescribable beauty
of the planet we have been given; on the other hand, is the unfortunate
reality of life for a significant number of our beautiful planet’s&amp;nbsp;inhabitants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When astronauts reflect on how peaceful, beautiful, and fragile the
Earth looks from space, these reflections are not clichés that
astronauts say because they feel good. &lt;em&gt;It is truly moving to look at
the Earth from space.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;We can look down at a particular part of the
Earth and feel empathy for the struggles that all people face. We can
look down with an orbital perspective and realize that we are all riding
through the Universe together on this spaceship we call Earth, that we
are all interconnected, that we are all in this together, that we are
all family. This is what we call the “Orbital&amp;nbsp;Perspective.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It saddens us and compels us to action when we realize that we have the
resources and technology to overcome almost all of the challenges facing
our planet, yet nearly a billion people do not have access to clean
water, countless go to bed hungry every night, and many die from
preventable and curable&amp;nbsp;diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe that we live in a world where the possibilities are limited
only by our imagination and our will to act. It is within our power to
eliminate the suffering and poverty that exist on our&amp;nbsp;planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is quite simple - &lt;strong&gt;just do something.&lt;/strong&gt; The challenges of
the world are really about how each of us individually responds to them.
In other words, to what extent does humanity, on a person-to-person
basis, commit to making a positive difference, no matter how small or
how&amp;nbsp;big?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is there are over 20 million organizations around the
world working to improve life on our planet where people can lend a&amp;nbsp;hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad news is, for the most part, these organization are not engaged
in a unified coordinated effort. There is a great deal of duplication of
effort and loss of&amp;nbsp;efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are we trying to&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the problem, let’s take a look at Felipe. Felipe has a
calling to make a difference in the world. Let’s say he wants to help
provide clean water to those who need it. Maybe Felipe wants to work
with an organization providing clean water or maybe he wants to donate
money to one of these many efforts. Felipe will find that there are
thousands of organizations dedicated to solving the global water crisis.
There is also a myriad of different technologies and different opinions
on how to best solve the problem. Felipe will spend countless hours
trying to find and sort through all the information on the subject.
After all that work he will not find a definitive, impartial, logical,
user-friendly listing of all his&amp;nbsp;options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let’s consider Celine. Celine founded an organization dedicated to
providing clean water. Celine’s organization is presently working in
country X and has run into problem Y. Celine does not realize that
another organization has already solved the problem she faces and the
current path that her organization is traveling down will lead to a dead
end. She doesn’t realize that there are other organizations out there
that have the pieces of the puzzle that she&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, let’s see about Maria. Maria lives in a village where people are
frequently ill due to the poor quality of the water in her village and
many die every year. Maria wants to help her village. Maria doesn’t
realize that there is an organization that is presently looking for
water projects to accomplish in her area and this organization is
presently unaware of the situation in her&amp;nbsp;village.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although these are hypothetical situations they accurately represent the
extremely disorganized state of humanitarian&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Ron’s personal objectives on his recent mission was to use the
orbital perspective to inspire people to go out and make a difference to
go out and make the world a better place. To that end, we created a
project called &lt;a href="http://fragileoasis.org/"&gt;Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. The vision for Fragile Oasis is to be
a vehicle to affect real change. Our idea was to pair systems on a
spacecraft designed to support life (provide clean water, air, energy,
health, etc.) to systems (or projects) on our spaceship Earth designed
to provide the same thing. By providing a means for people and
organizations in each of these categories to collaborate and develop
synergy toward overcoming our planet’s challenges, we help these
organizations that are striving to make the world a better place and
reach their&amp;nbsp;goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since there are multiple organizations looking for effective ways to
collaborate and synergize, it is critical to unify efforts to establish
an effective collaboration mechanism for people and organizations to
solve the challenges facing our world. By first bringing together those
organizations that are striving to pair challenges with solutions we
will be bringing together different unique pieces of the&amp;nbsp;puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this collaboration is to bring together different
perspectives to create one, simple, user-friendly mechanism to
communicate and collaborate to tackle the challenges facing our world.
By doing that we can all learn from each others’ successes and&amp;nbsp;mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Challenge for&amp;nbsp;RHoK:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What better way to hack for humanity than to create an effective
collaboration mechanism for people and organizations to solve the
challenges facing the world. We need help to launch a collaboration
platform, using data visualization and social networking resources to
represent challenges facing our planet and progress towards their
solutions, including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; Millennial Development&amp;nbsp;Goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ultimate goal is to reduce that sobering contradiction that we see
when we look at the Earth: that it is not only visibly beautiful, but a
place where life is beautiful for&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we challenge the RHoK community&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a robust, user-friendly database of projects worldwide that is
    easily accessed with all&amp;nbsp;metadata&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add map visualization and organization&amp;nbsp;functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add creative communication and chat capabilities that will allow
    everyone to connect and change the world&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See our problem statements at &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/18701"&gt;http://www.rhok.org/node/18701&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/catalyst-map"&gt;http://www.rhok.org/problems/catalyst-map&lt;/a&gt; for more&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a number of partners who have already contributed pieces to the
puzzle, including:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://fragileoasis.org/"&gt;Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwSzDZnNjUk"&gt;Coalition of the Willing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.usaid.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We envision that the overall solution&amp;nbsp;would:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be single&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not take a “one site to rule them all”&amp;nbsp;paradigm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not compete with existing collaboration/networking systems. We want
    to create a system that all humanitarian organizations can use to
    enhance their matching service on their own&amp;nbsp;sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow people to scan data visualizations of the problems and
    challenges these different organizations are addressing, and also of
    the real or potential impact (determined using standardized&amp;nbsp;metrics)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be helpful to people using individual organization’s sites. It
    wouldn&amp;#8217;t replace the individual sites – it would complement&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer for people and orgs to install widgets on their sites and
    access the data through the widget on their own&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be Open&amp;nbsp;Source.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be&amp;nbsp;user-friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be standardized and universally&amp;nbsp;accepted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be&amp;nbsp;apolitical.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be able to feed data to any&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The end product should be transparent to end&amp;nbsp;users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have robust social networking&amp;nbsp;features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have enhanced search&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow users to participate in Facebook style&amp;nbsp;chat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be self sufficient and financially&amp;nbsp;sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Research&lt;/a&gt; to work with Apple&amp;#8217;s iOS on iPhone^®^ 4 in order to perform
experiments onboard the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; National Laboratory on the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news.html"&gt;International
Space Station (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;SpaceLab for iOS&lt;/em&gt; app was transported to
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; on two, space certified iPhone 4&amp;#8217;s on the historic final mission
of the Space Shuttle program, &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts135/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135&lt;/a&gt;, on the orbiter Atlantis.  The
purpose of &lt;em&gt;SpaceLab for iOS&lt;/em&gt; is to demonstrate that an inexpensive
consumer electronics device can perform tasks previously reserved for
expensive single purpose devices.  Modern smart phones contain hardware
once only found in expensive avionics.  Where an avionics box may have
had a limited production run of 100&amp;#8217;s or 1000&amp;#8217;s of devices, a smart
phone may have a similar engineer investment but a longer production run
of millions, which significantly lowers the cost for users of the
device.  &lt;strong&gt;The goal of this project is to significantly lower the cost
of space flight and lower the barrier to access in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone^®^ 4 was chosen because it was the first widely accessible
hand held consumer electronics device with a high resolution display,
tactile interface, high density storage, 3-axis accelerometer, and
3-axis gyro.  A series of 4 experiments were selected that, when
combined, could prove that such a device could be used to locate a space
vehicle relative to Earth.  Space flight software is often created
with expensive specialized software, so &lt;em&gt;SpaceLab for iOS&lt;/em&gt; was
purposefully created using open source or free software when available. 
All the software is written with XCode, which is free from the Apple
website.  Most graphics were created with Gimp, which is a popular open
source graphics tool.  Even some of the mathematical algorithms were
designed and tested using Octave, an open source math utility, before
being converted to code.  During development, bug tracking was performed
by Trac and version control by Git, both open source utilities.  The
idea is that this is an avionics platform that many college students
already have, and they can write software for it using open source&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two smartphones are currently onboard the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  We are finalizing approval of the procedure and crew
training, and plan to have the smartphones unpacked and being used&amp;nbsp;shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four experiments are planned. The experiments contain step-by-step
procedures to allow a crew member to conduct the experiments without the
need for supplementary paper&amp;nbsp;procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limb Tracker&lt;/strong&gt; This navigation experiment will involve taking
photographs of the Earth and matching an arc to the horizon through
manipulation of an overlay. This performs the function roughly
equivalent to a “manual” horizon sensor. It will yield an estimate of
altitude (height above the surface) and “off axis” angle, a measurement
of the angle of the image with respect to the Earth&amp;#8217;s center.  When
returned to the ground, this data will be used to calibrate the camera
lens, which may have shifted during&amp;nbsp;launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensor Cal&lt;/strong&gt; This sensor calibration experiment uses a series of
photos of a reference image, combined with propagated information using
three-axis gyro and accelerometer measurements to calibrate the gyros
and the accelerometers (i.e. bias and scale coefficients). This will
improve the knowledge and accuracy of subsequent measurements.  The
calibrated optics will be used to calibrate the motion sensors by
providing a second means to determine&amp;nbsp;movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State Acq &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;State Acquisition&lt;/em&gt; - This navigation experiment uses a
series of photos of a reference image and of the Earth, combined with
information from the three-axis gyro and accelerometer, to estimate the
position of the spacecraft (latitude and longitude). The position
estimation is generated by manipulating and matching a wireframe overlay
of the Earth&amp;#8217;s coastlines to the acquired Earth image(s). Performing
multiple sequences, separated by a known amount of time, can permit
estimation of the spacecraft&amp;#8217;s orbit&amp;nbsp;parameters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LFI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lifecycle Flight Instrumentation&lt;/em&gt; - This experiment will
characterize the effects of radiation on the device by monitoring
certain areas of memory for Single Bit Upsets - an unintended change in
value of a memory location caused by exposure to&amp;nbsp;radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iPhone 4 was certified for spaceflight and was transported to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; on
the Space Shuttle via &lt;a href="http://nanoracks.com/"&gt;NanoRacks, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LLC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of Houston, Texas. NanoRacks
provides low-cost hardware and integration services for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.
&lt;/span&gt;National Laboratory onboard the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;. Both iPhone 4&amp;#8217;s will remain on the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; for several months where the experiments will be conducted by the
crew and data acquired and stored on the&amp;nbsp;devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app is available for download on the &lt;a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spacelab-for-ios/id441829040?mt=8&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;^℠^ so that ground
based users can get a sense of experience and tasks to be performed by
crew members on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;. Some features are simulated to account for the
presence of&amp;nbsp;gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the experiments are completed, both iPhones will be returned to
Earth. The first opportunity for return will be on a Russian Soyuz
vehicle in the spring of 2012. Flight data from the experiments are
expected to be collected, analyzed, and then shared via this app on the
App&amp;nbsp;Store.&lt;/p&gt;

the President&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt; Award. The &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award/about"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt; Award&lt;/a&gt;, which stands
for Securing Americans Value and Efficiency, was launched in 2009 by
President Obama. The award seeks ideas from federal employees to make
government more effective and efficient and ensure taxpayer dollars are
spent wisely. Matt is a Financial Manager on the &lt;a href="http://gems.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;Gravity Extreme
Magnetism &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMEX&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEMS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; Flight Project at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Goddard Space Flight
Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a &lt;a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/multi/explorer.html"&gt;long heritage&lt;/a&gt; of launching &lt;a href="http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/smex.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMEX&lt;/span&gt; or Small
Explorer&lt;/a&gt; missions. There have been over &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_program"&gt;92 Explorer class
missions&lt;/a&gt; launched by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, including &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/explorer1.html"&gt;Explorer 1&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;
satellite, and &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/cobe/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;COBE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whose science won the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/nobel_prize_mather.html"&gt;Nobel Prize for
Science&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Explorer class missions have the lowest cost of all
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; flight missions, which means that the cost and schedule are
typically very aggressive. So a large emphasis is put on creative ways
of saving cost. Join us as we catch up with Matt to hear the background
on his &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Award.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Welcome Matt, tell us about what its like on a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMEX&lt;/span&gt;
mission and the lead up to submitting your idea to the President&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Ritsko&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the challenges I have on a daily basis is to
look for ways of being as efficient with the resources we have available
to us in terms of staff, materials and time. We are on a very short
schedule and quick turn around to build &lt;a href="http://gems.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so we are always looking around Goddard for the right mix
of resources to accomplish the mission. I am very interested in finding
ways of being more&amp;nbsp;efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few flight projects at Goddard which had improved tracking
of parts that they had left over after they launched their mission,
including the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/iss_carriers.html"&gt;Express Logistics Carrier&lt;/a&gt; launched in 2009, which is
an un-pressurized attached payload for the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html"&gt;International Space
Station&lt;/a&gt;. As part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GEMS&lt;/span&gt;, I wanted to see what parts and tools we
could leverage off these other projects. After seeing what they did with
their internal tracking system, it seemed to make sense to enhance our
tracking of tools, such as benches, lifting slings, and shipping
containers. These items can add up to be pretty significant in cost over
the life-cycle of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; flight project. And when you have as many
&lt;a href="http://fpd.gsfc.nasa.gov/programs.html"&gt;in-house projects as you have here at Goddard&lt;/a&gt; at one point in time,
those cost savings can become pretty significant. At that point you can
start tying in both parts and tools and get at some great cost savings.
With some support, we can raise the bar for both parts and&amp;nbsp;tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: And when you talk about parts, do you mean parts that could fly
in space as&amp;nbsp;well?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, spaceflight parts, which are very expensive. There are
sometimes left over parts because in the space world, the time to test
and manufacture parts that can tolerate space is very time consuming and
expensive, so you always need spares on hand if parts fail. We put parts
through harsh testing, so that if its going to fail, it fails on the
ground. If a part fails after we launch it, we are sometimes limited on
ways to fix it. Projects are efficient now with parts; we look for ways
to trade and share parts between projects, but it can be a difficult&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: What are some factors which make that&amp;nbsp;difficult?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Once a project ends, most of the staff are moving on to the next
job. They do not necessarily have the time to find the homes for extra
spare parts and materials. In the process of these transitions, we often
times have a challenge of keeping track of the paper work associated
with it, which is critical for flight parts. You need to have very
detailed documentation to ensure the proper tests were done and that it
only contains certain materials. Without the paper work, you are
spending extra time and man hours to check these space parts and&amp;nbsp;materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: So how did you hear about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Award?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: I heard about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt; Award program though a Goddard-wide
email. I figured, it will only take a few minutes to submit, so sent it
in. It was a very innocent idea at the time and seemed like a good fit
for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt; and could be potentially beneficial for Goddard. I submitted
the idea July 14th. I did not hear anything back until about two months
ago, in September, when I got a call from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMB&lt;/span&gt; that the idea had made the
top ten. What I submitted was pretty simple and generic, so they were
looking for more details and the current state of things. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OMB&lt;/span&gt; then down
selected to the top 4, and invited us to a teleconference with the
President (which you can see on the top of the &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award"&gt;main &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt; Award website
here&lt;/a&gt;). That opened up the voting period on these top 4 ideas and on
Friday, November 18th, I received a call from Charlie Bolden, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Administrator, on my cell phone informing me that we&amp;nbsp;won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: So that call from Charlie was the first you heard of winning the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAVE&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Award?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Yes, that&amp;#8217;s the first I heard of it. Charlie was great to talk&amp;nbsp;to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: What are your initial plans to implement the&amp;nbsp;system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: We anticipate that there will be two pieces of this when we go
to implement it, one part is the tool crypt itself and the other part is
the software to manage the trace-ability. With the tools, you simply
check it in and check it out from the tool crypt. If we are talking
about a specific part to fly on a spacecraft, then you need that flight
hardware paperwork that is attached to it which shows all the tests, the
part source and its materials. We have some subject matter experts
examining some of the details for possible&amp;nbsp;implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Great, congratulations on your award and thanks for taking the
time to chat with&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;

Challenges Through Random Hacks of&amp;nbsp;Kindness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;December, 2011 - - On December 3rd and 4th, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt; and the World Bank, through their initiative &lt;a href="www.rhok.org"&gt;Random Hacks of
Kindness&lt;/a&gt; (RHoK), will bring together thousands of people in over 25
locations around the globe to “hack for humanity.” Random Hacks of
Kindness is a community of innovation that brings together subject
matter experts with volunteer technologists to develop open technology
solutions to the global&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During past RHoK events around the world, volunteers have worked on
applications that are already making an impact. &lt;a href="http://bushfireconnect.org/"&gt;Bushfire Connect&lt;/a&gt;, a
crowd-sourced mapping tool to report bushfires, is being used by local
communities across Australia. The Philadelphia Food Trust is promoting
&lt;a href="http://phillysnap.com/"&gt;PhillySNAP&lt;/a&gt;, a mobile application connecting recipients of food
stamps to sources of fresh produce. The World Bank is piloting
&lt;a href="http://www.chasm.info/structure/landslide_runout.htm"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHASM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, software for visualizing landslide risk, in the Caribbean.
The Government of Colombia has adopted &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/solutions/ataoli-v0-shelter-information-system-formulario-unico-de-albuergue-para-la-ola-invernal"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ATAOLI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a shelter management
system built at RHoK Bogota, to manage millions of people displaced
annually by winter storms. Other apps have received support and interest
from governments, NGOs and international organizations around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batman, eat your heart out.&lt;/strong&gt; From zero to 1,050 miles per hour, the
team behind the Bloodhound SuperSonic Car is taking the everyone along
for the ride on their engineering adventure to break the world land
speed record in 2013. The project is a huge challenge that will produce
untold technology spin-offs and aims to inspire the next generation of
engineers around the world through openness and&amp;nbsp;engagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Project Director Richard Noble and his team are building a car that will
go zero to 1,050 miles per hour (mph) in 40 seconds. Named after
Britain’s 1950s Bloodhound Missile Project, the Bloodhound Supersonic
Car (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt;) car is 12.8 meters long, weighs 6.4 tons, and cruises on high
grade aluminum wheels, which will experience radial stresses of up to
50,000 times the force of gravity at full&amp;nbsp;speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is risky, dangerous, and unprecedented. Focused on building
the safest car possible, Noble’s Bloodhound team intends to overthrow
the current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIA&lt;/span&gt; World Land Speed Record by 30 percent. “It’s such a huge
leap, of course we’re going to get into trouble,” said Noble. “We’re
going to learn an awful lot as we develop&amp;nbsp;it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World records aside, the team wants to capture the attention of students
and inspire a new generation of&amp;nbsp;engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Genesis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1898, French driver Gaston de Chasseloup-Laubat set the world land
speed record at 39 miles per hour (mph). Fast-forward to 1970, when
after decades of battle between the Americans and British, an
American-built car called &lt;em&gt;Blue Flame&lt;/em&gt; set a new record of 630 mph. “We
in Britain were very keen to get it back again,” said Noble. “Or, at
least, I was,” he&amp;nbsp;laughed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble assembled a team to build a new car, Thrust2. With Noble literally
in the driver’s seat, Thrust2 set a new record of 634 mph in 1983,
sparking a race for the sound&amp;nbsp;barrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building and modeling cars intended to travel upwards of 600 mph was
difficult, dangerous, and nearly impossible. Noble had pushed the limits
with Thrust2. “The [aerodynamic] data was varied and not reliable,” said
Noble. What designers needed was a transonic wind tunnel with a sort of
car treadmill capable of speeds up to 900 mph, he explained. This didn’t&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With competitors already at work, Noble decided to throw his hat into
the Mach 1 race with Thrust &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt;. This time around, Chief Aerodynamicist
Ron Ayers insisted on modeling the car. Software programs in the early
1990s facilitated new ways of using computational fluid aerodynamics
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt;) to model Thrust &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt;, but Ayers wanted to qualify their results.
The team went to a long rocket test track, normally used for
accelerating warheads up to Mach 3 and slamming them into slabs of
concrete, and used a modified rocket sled to confirm their results. They
ran 13 tests of their car and compared it to their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CFD&lt;/span&gt; data. “Amazingly,
we found there was just a 4 percent variation in the data,” said Noble.
This proved that the car was safe and&amp;nbsp;viable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1997, Thrust &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt; went supersonic five times in the Black Rock Desert
of Nevada. Fifteen miles away in the town of Gerlach, the sonic boom
knocked the covers off the classroom sprinkler system. “We all said that
we would never, ever do this again,” said Noble. Little did they know
they weren’t done—with building supersonic cars or rattling educational&amp;nbsp;establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meeting with the&amp;nbsp;Minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Thrust &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt;’s run, the late Steve Fossett, a world-renowned aviator
and sailor, expressed an interest in overtaking the new speed record. If
they waited, Noble and his team would spend five years studying how
Fossett bested them, and then another six years building a defender. 
“We all looked at each other, got slightly grey-haired, and decided
eleven years was too long,” said Noble. “We’d better do it&amp;nbsp;now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new car, the Bloodhound &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt;, would shoot for 1,000 mph. Two jet
engines on the car brought about too many design difficulties. A
combination of one jet engine and one rocket motor was more feasible.
Lightweight, small, and fuel-efficient, the Eurofighter-Typhoon &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EJ200&lt;/span&gt;
jet engine would be a perfect fit. However, there was only one place to
get the engine: Britain’s Ministry of&amp;nbsp;Defence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Driver Andy Green arranged a meeting with then-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.K.&lt;/span&gt; Science Minister
Lord Paul Drayson, who formerly held a post in the Ministry of Defence.
Drayson also happened to race cars. “The meeting remained very friendly
until I asked him for the jet engine,” Noble chuckled. Sensing they had
failed dismally, they started to retreat from the&amp;nbsp;room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Then Drayson said something that changed all of our lives,” said Noble.
“He said, ‘Look, there’s something you could do for us.’ I said, ‘Of
course, Minister, what can we do for you?’” Drayson explained that the
Ministry of Defense was having a problem with recruiting engineers.
There didn’t seem to be any in Britain anymore. During the 1960s, there
had been a new airplane every year, which got kids excited and motivated
them to become engineers. Drayson told Noble and Green that was the
goal: they could have their engine if they agreed to start an education
program with their&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble agreed and shook Drayson’s hand. “We walked out of his office
intent on setting up an enormous education program, which we knew
nothing&amp;nbsp;about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Engineering: A Dead&amp;nbsp;Subject?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble’s team went to work researching the state of education in Britain.
“We found all sorts of terrible things were happening,” he said.
Britain’s skilled workforce was on the decline, its students were
sliding in international rankings, and the country’s information
technology sector was dismal. They needed to create an Apollo-effect—to
inspire people to change their lives because of this&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their posters and a model of the car, the Bloodhound team attended
education exhibitions across the country, talking to as many &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;
(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) teachers as they
could. Their conversations went something like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s it like teaching &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Absolutely awful. It’s an absolute nightmare. The kids aren’t
interested. They are very arrogant. All they think they need to know how
to do is add, subtract, and work&amp;nbsp;percentages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sounds pretty&amp;nbsp;bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like teaching ancient Latin or Greek. You know, dead&amp;nbsp;subjects.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their conversations proved enlightening. “We needed to do something
exciting,” said Noble, “but above all, we had to be able to share the
information.” If they were going to educate Britain, teachers needed to
be able to understand the charts, models, and drawings so they could
make new lesson plans and explain it to their students. Every aspect of
the project had to be entirely&amp;nbsp;accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lack of secrecy initially worried the Bloodhound team. Then they
realized that their fears were unnecessary. The only rules for the land
speed record are that the car must have at least four wheels and be
controlled by the driver. “All of the cars and all of the challengers
are completely different,” said Noble. “The technology simply won’t
transfer from one competitor to another. We realized that we could make
all of the data available. Absolutely&amp;nbsp;everything.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nitrous: Not Quite So&amp;nbsp;Funny.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloodhound team is blazing a new trail. They still have many
challenges to overcome, but have learned a great deal so far. One
particular lesson came from choosing the oxidizer for their hybrid
rocket motor. The team thought it had an easy answer: nitrous oxide
(N~2~O). Safe, reliable, and easily accessible, N~2~O seemed a sensible
choice. Not so, warned one of Noble’s peers—N~2~O is not to be trifled&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noble investigated the claim. After scouring the Web, his team found a
paper from 1936 that explained how pressurizing N~2~O beyond 13 bar
could cause an explosion. “Whole plants had been taken out by nitrous
oxide explosions,” explained Noble. Nitrous was also the culprit in a
2007 Scaled Composites explosion that killed three people. The
Bloodhound team was&amp;nbsp;shocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They selected high-test peroxide (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTP&lt;/span&gt;) as an alternative that is less
likely to set off an N~2~O -like explosion. Testing with smaller rockets
has been successful, with the rocket motor running at 98 percent
catalyst efficiency. The team is currently doing testing on the
full-scale&amp;nbsp;motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Team: Grey to&amp;nbsp;Green &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Rocket Engineer Daniel Jubb worked the N~2~O problem. He joined
the Bloodhound team in 2005 when he got a call from Noble for a meeting.
Highly recommended by several seasoned rocket engineers, Noble drove out
to Manchester to meet Jubb. “I discovered that I was face to face with a
guy who was twenty-three,” said&amp;nbsp;Noble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Jubb to Ayers (who is in his eighties), Noble respects the
importance of having a generationally diverse team. Typically, young
engineers only see one part of a project. Rarely do they see the whole
lifecycle. “Getting the overview perspective is very, very important,”
said Noble. The project is demanding, but offers young engineers (the
youngest is 18) the opportunity for gaining tremendous experience and
acts as a stepping stone to a future&amp;nbsp;career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s very important from our point of view to use as many young people
as we possibly can,” said Noble. He finds the younger generation’s
rapport with technology enormously useful. “But, of course, they’ve got
to be able to contribute to the project.” The flat structure of the
Bloodhound organization facilitates this. Everyone has their own set of
responsibilities and the authorizations, and everyone in the
organization is empowered. “Anyone can go fail the project if they
wanted to,” said Noble. “One would think this is some sort of
undisciplined rabble, but it’s certainly&amp;nbsp;not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You end up with a very, very fast moving, highly motivated organization
and therefore can do [great things] on very small sums of money,” said
Noble. (Thrust &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt; was completed for £2.4 million, 12 percent of what
their competitors&amp;nbsp;budgeted.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something Incredibly Wonderful Will&amp;nbsp;Happen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partway through the project, Noble and his team realized there was a
flaw in their openness plan. “If we were going to put up all of the
operational data after each run on the web, we’d have to be very clever
about the way we actually presented it,” said Noble. “Unless people were
given the appropriate education, they wouldn’t understand the data. It
would just be numbers to them and they wouldn’t really be able to take
part in the&amp;nbsp;program.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the lead from the highly successful Khan Academy, Noble partnered
with Southampton University to develop educational tools the public will
need to engage with the Bloodhound &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt; data flow. Today there are 4,600
schools in Britain and 207 countries worldwide participating in the
Bloodhound engineering adventure, as the team preps for their 2013 run
in South Africa. Via the Bloodhound &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SSC&lt;/span&gt; website, anyone can be a part of
the project through &lt;a href="http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/goodies/video_game.cfm"&gt;games&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/goodies/videos.cfm"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/media/car_images.cfm"&gt;pictures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/car.cfm"&gt;explanations of the car elements&lt;/a&gt;, drawings, or &lt;a href="http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/news/richard_nobles_diary/august_2011.cfm"&gt;blog posts
from Noble&lt;/a&gt;. Just months ago, the team posted a suite of &lt;a href="http://www.bloodhoundssc.com/search.cfm?faArea1=customWidgets.contentItem_show_1&amp;amp;cit_id=5018"&gt;40
computer-aided design (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CAD&lt;/span&gt;) drawings&lt;/a&gt; online to help people understand
how the car was designed and built. There have been approximately 2,500
downloads of the&amp;nbsp;drawings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It might well be that someone makes a [copy], which would be
brilliant,” chuckled Noble. “We could&amp;nbsp;race!”&lt;/p&gt;

techniques in social media can be utilized effectively to collaborate …
and in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s case, push the frontier of space exploration? It&amp;#8217;s now
been one week since we launched the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Google+ account and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has
seen an overwhelming positive response. Over the last few years, we have
been impressed with the rapid growth of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s social media presence, so
we pulled the data for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ at the 20,000
mark. It took #&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; 469 days to reach 20,000 followers on Twitter, 276
days on Facebook, and only 4 days on Google+. As of this morning,
between the three platforms, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a combined reach of 2,264,854
(1,605,159 on twitter, 625,459 on Facebook, 34,236 on Google+). With
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s almost 35,000 followers on Google+, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;a href="http://socialstatistics.com/top/pages"&gt;the third most
popular non-Google page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more interesting than the number of followers on the Google+
platform, is how active the community has been. In the first week of
use, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; posted 53 times to Google+. These posts generated 18,854 +1&amp;#8217;s,
7,969 shares and 1996 comments. The most popular post was the time lapse
video from&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of possibilities for innovation through social media at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and this level of activity on this new media platform confirms
there is still space to experiment and grow. In the next few weeks, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
will continue to share our amazing and iconic imagery, but we are also
planning on hosting hangouts with our scientists, engineers, and maybe
even Astronauts! Our first hangout will be on Monday November 21st at
3pm &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt; with our Open Government Initiative. We&amp;#8217;ll be discussing Open
Source, Open Data and Social&amp;nbsp;Media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#8217;d love to hear what ideas you have on how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; uses social media
and invite you to share your thoughts here or on any of our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; social
media&amp;nbsp;platforms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

*&amp;#8221;I challenge &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; leaders at all levels to create an environment*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

*that embraces and supports telework*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

*for employees who are eligible and interested.&amp;#8221;*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Administrator Charles Bolden

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

**I love teleworking.**With members across four time zones, the freedom
and resources to work from wherever (and whenever) we are has been vital
to the success of our small, distributed team. Instead of a cubicle, a
workstation, and a desk phone, members of our team have a laptop, a cell
phone, and permission to go and create the work environment that best
suits them. **Work becomes what we do – not a place where we go.**We all
started as ‘digital natives,’ bringing hardware and technological
experience to the work before us. Familiar with what works and how it
works, the challenge became finding the best ways to apply that
experience to our professional assignments. There were all kinds of
great software and hardware out there, and we wanted to take full
advantage of&amp;nbsp;them.
&lt;/p&gt;
Here are a few of the tools we use to make effective teleworking
possible. Some of them we use on our team; some of them we are working
to use in the future. Every app has ‘competitors’ that serve similar
functions.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

-   **Skype**: a web application that allows chat as well as voice and
    video calls. Skype allows distributed teams instant access to each
    other to ask questions and share updates.
-   **Adobe Connect**: a web application that creates an integrated
    virtual environment where participants can share audio, video, chat,
    references, and screens. The platform provides workers everything
    needed to host or support a regular meeting from anywhere that you
    are.
-   **Asana**: a web task-management application that supports
    efficiency among distributed teams. Tools like Asana allow teams to
    keep track of who is doing what and where they are investing our
    time and efforts.
-   **Google Docs**: a web application that allows for real-time
    collaboration to write, edit and store documents online. Workers can
    use Google Docs on a daily basis to write and edit together, saving
    multiple emails with updates and version control. (We&amp;#8217;ve recently
    joined one of the agency&amp;#8217;s pilot efforts with Google Apps and are
    enjoying trying out many of its capabilities!)
-   **Dropbox**: a web-based file-hosting service that syncs across
    machines and operating systems. Dropbox and other similar products
    allow distributed teams to host a library of documents and
    presentations in the cloud so that they can all have real-time
    access to the latest versions of anything they might need.

&lt;div&gt;

Teleworking adds value and efficiency to our work as well as quality to
our lives.Teleworking allows me to **choose the environment most
suitable to my work** that day. I will often head to our collaborative
space for meetings, a comfortable option where a group can diagram out
ideas on white boards. If I need to write, I will often stay home and
sit on the porch where it’s quiet, and I have easy access to my own
kitchen. On days where I have numerous tasks and administrative work, I
tend to engage the best at a coffee shop with a little music and other
people.While my teammates and I are rarely located in the same city, I
think I **engage better** with them - more frequently and more
efficiently - than I did with coworkers who were co-located in a
traditional office. The tools make it easy to access them and their
expertise while making the best use of their time and resources as&amp;nbsp;well.
&lt;/p&gt;
Teleworking flexibility is a huge investment in **work-life balance**,
allowing employees the opportunity to work around their unique needs and
situations, whether it means avoiding the worst commute times, being
available for their children as needed, or collaborating across
timezones.

The opportunity to work remotely also **brings &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; out into the
community**, making us visible and available to many more people in the
neighborhood. People frequently see my computer (covered with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
stickers), see my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; fleece or overhear my obviously &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-related
conversation and come up and talk to me about space. This is an
opportunity to be accessible and be an ambassador.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

![Telecommuting][]  
**Tips for new teleworkers:**

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be available. You can’t disappear; the trade-off for being remote is
    being &lt;em&gt;responsive&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overcommunicate what you are doing to your team, at least at the
    beginning. Relationships shift when you don’t see each other; be
    sure that you are providing the connection and the content everyone
    needs to keep working together, as well as being accountable to your&amp;nbsp;manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out what you need to stay focused and stay organized. If you
    tend to slack off and sleep late, find a coffee shop or coworking
    space. If you are easily distracted, define a home office space.
    It’s different for everyone. Let your colleagues find their space
    and routine, and you find&amp;nbsp;yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn what technology can do! Become an educated user. Get familiar
    with the capabilities of your laptop, smartphone, tablet. Explore
    your options. There is very little that can’t be accomplished&amp;nbsp;remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be sure that you have whatever tools you need to access your data
    and your systems, whether it&amp;#8217;s an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RSA&lt;/span&gt; token or something&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Appear in the office regularly, and if your team is distributed,
    schedule times to work together in person. Our team tries to cowork
    together at least once a quarter, and it becomes incredibly fruitful
    time for us professionally and&amp;nbsp;relationally.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enjoy it! Teleworking is a privilege that allows you to do your job
    better. Your management is telling you that they trust you and
    believe in the work you do. Take advantage, and let that show in
    your passion, your commitment and your&amp;nbsp;productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

We had three
billion in 1959, four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987 and six
billion in 1998. A little over one week ago, the human population on
planet Earth reached seven billion. This marks an important milestone
for our species. Fifty years ago, shortly before John F. Kennedy issued
his challenge to reach the moon, we had just crossed the three billion
mark. This expansion is a testament to our ability to produce, grow, and
connect. Perhaps the most important innovation tying us together since
then has been the advent of the public Internet. As we’ve grown and
become more dispersed over the planet, the Internet has allowed us to
instantaneously connect and communicate in new and exciting&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we may still see the Internet largely as a productivity tool,
or as a way to access information, it’s become so much more than that.
It’s a collaboration platform that is bringing us together. With the
acceleration of digital convergence and increasingly pervasive use of
digital devices to access all manner of information, the Internet has
become a platform for participation. Each second, the world’s
information is increasingly sorted, sifted, and combined in various
useful and creative ways by communities of people from all corners of
the world. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and now Google+ are
reshaping human interactions and helping us connect to one&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an agency trusted with charting the universe and expanding human
knowledge, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has long been at the forefront of using the Internet to
communicate with and involve citizens in our mission of space
exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; had
one of the first websites on the Internet in the 90s, obtained one of
the first accounts on Twitter in 2007, and began Tweeting in late 2008.
We have now launched our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; presence on Google+ as the first
government agency on the&amp;nbsp;platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an exciting step for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and we have already seen enormous
interest from the Google+ community - we had over a thousand new
followers in the first hour! We look forward to exploring this new
engagement platform and innovating how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; shares&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

I go out and talk about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; quite often, and tell many parts of the
agency&amp;#8217;s long and amazing story. I frequently get to work with
fascinating people who are doing cool work, and indulge our mutual
passions about space exploration. Nevertheless, I have never been so
proud to work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, so confident about the technology in our future,
so inspired to invest time, energy and passion - as I was this past
weekend at [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;][]. Technology collaborations are vital for us to
accomplish our mission - but it&amp;#8217;s the vision for transformation and the
commitment of the community that truly sets this partnership apart.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

The [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;][1] program identifies innovations poised to create
transformational change in critical sustainability issues, connects
innovators to thought leaders and advisors, and then provides resources
and guidance in order to accelerate the implementation of the
technologies and projects. Founded in a unique partnership between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, the Department of State, and Nike, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Energy focuses on
challenges that face us on Earth and beyond the Earth. The focus of this
year&amp;#8217;s challenge is energy, and the ten finalists were chosen for their
groundbreaking ideas for the provision of more sustainable energy
sources and improved access to energy for both developed and developing
world populations.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Energy Forum, which [brings together][] the innovators and
council members, took place at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on
November 11-13. The forum sessions are designed to identify key
challenges and opportunities for the entrepreneurs&amp;#8217; innovations in an
effort to accelerate these transformative efforts into the world with
impact and scale.

**Why was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; started, and what is unique about it?**  
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s [Beth Beck][] writes [here][] about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHY&lt;/span&gt; behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;. She
explains that innovators and early adopters are comfortable making gut
decisions driven by what they believe about the world, rather than just
by what product is available for their use, while the early majority
doesn’t like to try something until someone else tries it first. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
is about creating a fellowship of innovators who then create a space
that actually accelerates innovation&amp;#8230; and changing the world. The
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; Council knows [what kind of world they want][] - now they are
helping make it possible one issue at a time.

**This year&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Energy featured innovations:**  
*Gram Power*: A micro/mini-grid solution for underserved communities
that utilizes modular battery storage technology, energy management
intelligence, and a pre-payment model. “Reliable power is a critical
ingredient for development. Gram Power creates access to this basic
resource, enabling 40% of the world population to get connected to the
global marketplace and become a part of the modern information economy,”
said founder and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; Yashraj Khaitan.

[Hydrovolts][]: An affordable &amp;#8220;Switchblade&amp;#8221; turbine and &amp;#8220;Flipwing&amp;#8221;
turbine rotor that enables reliable hydroelectricity generation from
canals and other managed-flow water courses. “We’re changing the
paradigm of how water can answer our energy challenges,” founder and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt;
Burt Hamner notes.

*Turbococina*: A revolutionary clean and efficient wood combustion
cookstove. “This is a revolutionary wood combustion technology, which
manages to transform the kitchen from a smoke laden hazardous
environment into a clean and habitable place,” explained &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CTO&lt;/span&gt; and
President Rene Nuñez Suarez.

[Point Source Power][]: An economical fuel cell for emerging markets
that allows battery charging in cooking pits or fires. Co-founder and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; Craig Jacobson is committed to making power innovation culturally
relevant, easy to use, and financially accessible for 1.5 billion people
without electricity.

[The Solanterns Initiative][]: An initiative dedicated to replacing 1
million of Kenya&amp;#8217;s kerosene lanterns with solar powered lights and to
creating micro-entrepreneur jobs. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COO&lt;/span&gt; Nina Marsalek emphasized how
microfinance collaborations can make solar lanterns accessible to
everyone.

[Powerzoa][]: A smart system that allows enterprise-level energy
managers to automate control of energy down to the appliance level,
stopping power waste. Powerzoa’s Sandra Kwak and Jamie Simon are
committed to enabling behavior change in the energy efficiency,

[Promethean Power Systems][]: A rural refrigeration system for
commercial cold-storage applications in off-grid and partially
electrified areas of developing countries. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; Sorin Grama’s system
enables food suppliers to reliably store and preserve perishable food
items—such as milk, fruits and vegetables—without the need for expensive
diesel-powered generators.

[Thermofluidics][]: A pumping device that uses low-temperature heat to
generate fluid motion with very few moving parts. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; Mark Bryant
explained the function of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIFTE&lt;/span&gt; pump, where gravity, suction and
heat provide a better way to pump water&amp;#8230; and just about anything else,
too.

[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ITN&lt;/span&gt; Energy Systems][]: A revolutionary flexible electrochromic film for
windows that allows active control of the sun&amp;#8217;s transmitted light and
heat. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; Ashutosh Misra said that “with flexible electrochromics, any
window can be modified so that flipping a switch changes its opacity to
let heat in when the building is too cold, or block that heat from
entering when it’s not needed.”

[NanoTune Technologies][]: A new generation ultracapacitor with five to
seven times greater energy storage capacity as conventional capacitors.
Creator and founder Frank Wang reminded the council of Elon Musk’s
statement that ultracapacitors will eventually replace batteries - and
how vital it is for us to be able to power our future innovations.

**What happened at the forum?**  
During the three day forum, innovators discussed their proposed
solutions to energy issues with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; Council members, who represent
the business, investment, international development, policy,
engineering, science, communications and sustainability sectors. The
sessions are designed to identify key challenges and opportunities for
the entrepreneurs&amp;#8217; innovations in an effort to accelerate these
transformative innovations into the world with impact and scale.

Innovators? Check out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s [MindMapr][] to follow the conversations.

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is seriously committed to help propel promising innovations forward
that will address some of the world’s most pressing challenges. Along
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, the Department of State, and Nike, we are creating a forum
that truly convenes genius that substantively changes the world. In the
closing ceremony, Point Source Power&amp;#8217;s Craig Jacobson pointed out that
&amp;#8220;innovation is a person-to-person endeavor, and that&amp;#8217;s what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;
does.&amp;#8221; Solid [public-private partnerships][] enable entrepreneurs and
innovators to share what they were doing, find a path forward and build
a new network of collaborators. Every person in attendance
was [inspired][] about how to take ideas and make them reality. We saw
amazing technology - the fastest ultracapacitor, revolutionary pumps
that use free heat, the cleanest cook stove in the world - but it was
really about the **people**, and about the power of what we can
do **together**.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

We walked through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Apollo/Saturn V Center on the last night of the
event, and the film presentation noted that this was *&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230;one of those
rare moments where history is not just made, but destiny is embraced.&amp;#8221;*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

**So say we all. **

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The History of Lorem&amp;nbsp;Ipsum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum"&gt;Lorem ipsum&lt;/a&gt; is slightly jumbled latin, the remnants of a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum"&gt;sections
1.10.32–3&lt;/a&gt; from Cicero’s ”&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_finibus_bonorum_et_malorum"&gt;&lt;em&gt;de Finibus Bonorum et
Malorum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” (The Extremes of Good and Evil), which begins with the
words &amp;#8216;Neque porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,
consectetur, adipisci velit&amp;#8230;&amp;#8217; which means “&lt;em&gt;there is no one who loves
pain itself, who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it
is pain&lt;/em&gt;”. &lt;a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/114222/en-us"&gt;Written in 45 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, this treatise on the theory of ethics
was very popular in the Renaisance, and the jumpled version of the text
started to be used in the 1500’s as filler text for designers and has
been the industry standard since&amp;nbsp;then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use Lorem&amp;nbsp;Ipsum?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem Ipsum text is used because readable text is often a distraction
during the design process. For example, when designing a website, a
designer will insert lorem ipsum text if the place of real text. Instead
of looking at the layout to find the problems or weak spots, people will
unconsciously focus on the words. For years, designers have depended on
this latin gibberish to help them to focus on the positioning, spacing,
color, and other stylistic&amp;nbsp;elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space&amp;nbsp;Ipsum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a number of online tools and Lorem Ipsum generators, the most
popular being &lt;a href="http://www.lipsum.com/"&gt;Lipsum&lt;/a&gt;, that help designers generate the exact amount
of filler text they require, but they often lack personality. There are
&lt;a href="http://getbraizen.com/2011/10/lorem-ipsum-do-huh/"&gt;a few out there that innovate on the concept&lt;/a&gt;. For example, &lt;a href="http://hipsteripsum.me/"&gt;Hipster
Ipsum&lt;/a&gt;, mashes up hipster culture with latin text, and &lt;a href="http://cupcakeipsum.com/"&gt;Cup Cake
Ipsum&lt;/a&gt;, adds a bits of text like &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;chocolate bar danish&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; to the
filler text - and that got us thinking - wouldn’t it be great to have a
generator that uses historic space&amp;nbsp;quotes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;space ipsum&amp;#8221; generator produces random filler content that you can
use for a number of purposes ranging from website design to school
essays. We do not recommend using text generated from a random content
generator for your school&amp;nbsp;essays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use the generator, visit &lt;a href="http://spaceipsum.com/"&gt;Space Ipsum&lt;/a&gt;, and simply enter a number
and then click &amp;#8220;engage&amp;#8221;. The output will be a selection of content
generated from a database of famous quotes from the history of
spaceflight. Additionally, you can choose to output the content in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;
format by checking the appropriate&amp;nbsp;button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsive&amp;nbsp;Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Space Ipsum site also perhaps &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s first experiment in responsive
design - the idea the content should not dictate the look and feel of
the site.  No matter what type of platform you view the website on,
you&amp;#8217;ll always be able to access it&amp;#8217;s core features due to the use of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS3&lt;/span&gt; media queries. This is an evolution in web design and represents
the future of how web design should act.  The site also features some of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s historic space images that load as the background randomly when a
user visits the site.  We&amp;#8217;ve put the code on github and encourage others
to use it for their&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s&amp;nbsp;Next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side-project actually lays the foundation for a bigger project we
are working on that mashes up historic &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; content in a new and useful
way, but we’ll save the details on that project for another blog post in
the near&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="django"></category><category term="lorem ipsum"></category><category term="sciencehackday"></category><category term="spaceipsum"></category><category term="webapp"></category></entry><entry><title>Time Lapse View from Space</title><link href="/time-lapse-view-from-space" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-11-13T04:14:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2011-11-13:time-lapse-view-from-space</id><summary type="html">&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32001208?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" width="580" height="326"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

notably, the successful &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with
&lt;a href="http://www.google.com/"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.yahoo.com/"&gt;Yahoo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.worldbank.org/"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.hp.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This
weekend, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is participating in the sold-out &lt;a href="http://sf.sciencehackday.com/"&gt;2011 San Francisco
Science Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; and we&amp;#8217;re bringing all the action to you as it&amp;nbsp;happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/32023250?title=0&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;portrait=0" frameborder="0" width="575" height="323"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://sciencehackday.com/"&gt;Science Hack Day&lt;/a&gt; is part of a larger movement of “&lt;em&gt;hacking&lt;/em&gt;” as a
new collaborative approach to problem solving. &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hack_Day"&gt;Hack days&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; offer a
unique opportunity to collaborate on focused tasks for a short period of
time by a small groups of developers and are capable of producing
remarkable results. The original concept of a hack day was
popularized by &lt;a href="http://blog.chaddickerson.com/2006/06/14/yahoo-hack-day-tomorrow-and-some-of-my-inspirations/"&gt;Yahoo! in 2005&lt;/a&gt; and soon after became a worldwide
trend. Science Hack Days started in &lt;a href="http://london2010.sciencehackday.com/"&gt;London in 2010&lt;/a&gt; by a developer
named &lt;a href="http://adactio.com/"&gt;Jeremy Keith&lt;/a&gt; who wanted to apply the concept to the field of
science. Since then events had been planned in numerous cities around
the world, [bridging the gap between the science, technology and design
industries and encouraging future collaboration, community building and
general social awareness of one&amp;nbsp;another.][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly can you expect from a Science Hack Day? Well, imagine a
Venn diagram where the intersection is a mix of web developers and
science geeks. A world where scientists, developers, designers,
technologists, and visionaries, from all walks of life, come together
for an intense weekend to build, create and make things in the name of
science. That&amp;#8217;s Science Hack Day.  &amp;#8230; and the goal? &lt;em&gt;Take something
from idea to prototype in 48&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve never experienced a hack day, it&amp;#8217;s an exciting all-night
marathon experience, that amplifies your creativity and challenges you
to collaborate with others on projects that you&amp;#8217;d normally not have a
chance to&amp;nbsp;tackle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue for the San Francisco event is &lt;a href="http://sfbrightworks.org/"&gt;Bright Works&lt;/a&gt;- a school for
students in K - 12 that reimagines education by providing hands-on,
project-based experiential learning. There tagline says it all:
&amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;everything is interesting, we can create anything&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;#8221; What&amp;#8217;s so
exciting about this particular event is that we are not only guests in
their inspirational space, but that a number of students from the Bright
Works school are actually participating.  Sitting right next to
developers from top Silicon Valley tech companies are eager students,
who are not only here to learn, but in some cases are actually the ones
teaching others how to use technology like laser cutters and 3d&amp;nbsp;printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So how does it work?&lt;/em&gt;  The first day kicked off with a series of
lightening talks - short presentations (less then 10 minutes each) on
subjects ranging from &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;hacking cognitive science with crowdsourced
experiments&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;developing open source underwater rovers&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;. &lt;a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/sherron/"&gt;Sean
Herron&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; OpenGov team gave a standing-room only talk
discussing &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;the great universe of data&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;and challenged the participants
to utilize the massive amounts of data &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; collects each day during
it&amp;#8217;s space exploration missions. &lt;a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/cgerty/"&gt;Chris Gerty&lt;/a&gt; from the OpenGov team,
who also doubles as our local video-editing genius, captured all the
action and we shared his work at the top of this&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a short break for lunch, the 200+ attendees self-organized around
a massively diverse set of topics and plunged head first into projects
that kept many of them up through the evening. The &lt;a href="http://sciencehackday.pbworks.com/w/page/32557641/SF-hacks"&gt;Science Hack Day
wiki&lt;/a&gt; captures a short description of the 21 proposed projects, but
given the close proximity of amazingly talented hackers, it&amp;#8217;s no
surprise that a number of new projects formed based on the unique
collaborations that would have never have happened&amp;nbsp;otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few other noteable aspects of the event included the participation of
10 Scienc Hack Day Ambassadors from Brazil, Canada, Germany, Iceland,
Ireland, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa and the United States. &lt;a href="http://sciencehackday.com/news/"&gt;The
ambassadors,&lt;/a&gt; who were funded thanks to the generous support of the
&lt;a href="http://www.sloan.org/"&gt;Alfred P. Sloan Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, included a European astrophysist turned
scientist for development, Mathematical physist, an artificial
intelligence researcher, an author, and a number of other equally
interesting entrepreneurs. Not to be shown up, a group of impressive 5th
graders developed working prototypes of video games using the
&lt;a href="http://unity3d.com/"&gt;Unity&lt;/a&gt; platform and &lt;a href="http://sketchup.google.com/"&gt;Google Sketchup&lt;/a&gt; in less then 4 hours. We were
all appropriately&amp;nbsp;humbled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much we can learn from events like Science Hack Day and it&amp;#8217;s
hard to capture it all in a short blog post, but we&amp;#8217;ve shared some
photos from the event below and tomorrow we&amp;#8217;ll be updating this post
with a list of some of our favorite hacks. We&amp;#8217;ll also reveal a project
we worked on that mashes up &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data in a new&amp;nbsp;way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Day 2&amp;nbsp;Update&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science Hack Day San Francisco 2011 was overwhelming successful.  27
projects were presented on Sunday afternoon and we think the results
speak for themselves.  We&amp;#8217;ve captured a brief synopsis and short
presentation highlighting the &lt;a href="http://sciencehackday.pbworks.com/w/page/47743279/sfhacks2011"&gt;projects&lt;/a&gt; below and have also provided

&lt;p&gt;Type faces should be very well balanced, but does that mean jsut
visually balanced? What about aerodynamically balanced? Took helevitica
type face and built a mini-wind tunnel to test the drag coefficient for
all the letters of the alphabet. Ideally, all the letters should have
the same drag coefficient. Took the letters and changed the weights so
they all balance out aerodynamically. &lt;a href="http://twitpic.com/7dpbrd"&gt;http://twitpic.com/7dpbrd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Umasking reality. Reality is far too complex because of the massive
amounts of information, so we set out to hack our senses by sending
sensory input to the wrong sense with the goal of purposely confusing
our brain (and it’s associated data filtering algorithms). Essentially,
the mask takes in a visual input and outputs a signal to influence our
sense of touch. Implemented using a web cam (visual input) that goes
into an ardunio that drives sixty 60-cent mini speakers that affect your
sense of&amp;nbsp;touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Large Hadron Collider Data&amp;nbsp;Hack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the experiments from the Large Hadron Collider, the Compact Muon
Solenoid (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CMS&lt;/span&gt;) experiment), has released a small amount of the data for
educational purposes. A partical physicist brought the data to see what
they could hack with the data. The data is hard to access and even more
difficult to understand (both from the formats and physics), so it
turned into a hack that tried to explain the data through data
visualization that will be ultimately useful for physicists at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CERN&lt;/span&gt; and
Fermi Lab. For more information:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AIDS&lt;/span&gt; spread follows complex human network dynamics, the details of
which are very difficult to measure. The team explored a proof of
concept hack using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WEKA&lt;/span&gt;, a data mining software in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JAVA&lt;/span&gt;, that explores
the data sets to analyze various indicators in a meaningful way to
determine risk of being &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt; positive, without asking any personal
questions. This could inform prevention and intervention&amp;nbsp;policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Buckets of&amp;nbsp;Tears&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;bucketsoftears.com is a data visualization and crowdsourcing project to
provide a web interface to bring comfort to people who are experiencing
sadness. The visualization presents tweets from all over the world that
contain the word “crying” in multiple languages. While they are being
streamed in real time, tear droplets show up on a world map to indicate
their location. The team continues to work on adding a &amp;#8220;Comfort&amp;#8221; button
which which visitors can interact with the sad tweeters to cheer them
up. Screenshots, photos and videos are available at

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Space&amp;nbsp;Ipsum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed filler text, but wished you had more exciting
options then the generic “lorem ipsum” variations? If so, you are in
luck! The team created a space themed random content generator, that
uses phrases from historic moments in spaceflight available at
htp://spaceipsum.com. More information available at:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EpiCell&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disease is prevalent but healthcare is not universal. Fortunately, much
of the world now has access to a cell phone. Technologies are being
developed that can turn cell phones into diagnostic devices. These
devices can be used at the point of care and the information can be
transmitted in real-time to experts and databases. If properly deployed
and used, mobile diagnostic devices could facilitate addressing the
needs of individuals in impoverished areas and tracking the emergence of
disease outbreaks. To determine where such devices should be deployed,

&lt;p&gt;Using a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; extraction protocol, the team created a product of which
also happens to be a tasty cocktail. Fruit cells (strawberry and others)
are lysed by freeze/thaw and heat cycles to eliminate the use of
surfactants. Salt is minimized and sugar added in order to mask any
salty flavor. Bacardi 151 is layered over fruit purée to extract &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;
into the ethanol phase. A tiny umbrella completes the tropical vibe.

&lt;p&gt;Using the Thalamoid platform, the team connected an Android mobile
device to analog ultrasonic scientific sensors to demonstrate the &amp;#8216;s
ability to serve as a data collection system. The system logs
environmental data to an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SD&lt;/span&gt; card in addition to displaying it on the
screen for immediate feedback. The team attached ultrasonic sensors to
record real data using a mobile device and then pass the data to the

&lt;p&gt;This project is designed to visualize some of the environmental data on
threatened species published by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt;, an international organisation
helping governments tackle the economic, social and governance
challenges of a globalised economy. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OECD&lt;/span&gt; produces reports on the
state of the environment based on data from participating countries. The
aim of this project is to compile and visualize the information on
threatened (endangered, vulnerable, and critically endangered) species
by country so that it is easily accessible. The current hack only
includes the mammals data, but new pages for fish, birds, amphibians,
invertebrates, plants, and reptiles will be added soon. The project is
built with the Google Chart apis for visualizing data. Currently in use
are the geo chart and bar chart. The hack &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; is

&lt;p&gt;The inspiration for this project came out of frustration of what’s
available to analyize your own genome data. Many people have their own
23andMe genotype (&lt;a href="https://www.23andme.com/"&gt;https://www.23andme.com/&lt;/a&gt;), but there is not gene
broswer to understand the variants. The team developed a basic genome
browser to display &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SNP&lt;/span&gt; data from 23andMe, showing the rarity of each
genotype, overlaid on the gene structure. The hack &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; is

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Titled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In scientific publications, credibility is judged by the number of
citations which is ultimately a poor metric. With the rise of electronic
publishing and the social web, there are exciting new opportunities to
look at a broader dimension of how a researcher influences his peers and
is in turn influenced. The team decided to adapt a technique often used
by corporations to get a feel for what people are saying about them
online to look at one dimension of academic impact which has until now
gotten little attention. Using the Open APIs provided by the open access
publisher the Public Library of Science, the team analyzed research
papers and gave them a score corresponding to how much confidence an
author of a paper expressed in his work. This allows us to tune into the
signals expressed by the researcher about his own work, which gives us a
much earlier signal of potential importance than we get by waiting for a
paper to get citations. It&amp;#8217;s a good thing in some respects that science
moves slow, but nothing’s fast enough for researchers pushing the
leading edge of research in areas like cancer research, stem cell
biology, and other critical rersearch areas. Screenshots, photos and

&lt;p&gt;Physical objects have a sensory richness of meaning that screen-based
elements do not. When we see, hear and feel real-world objects we are
enabled to train both cognitive and perceptual skills in combination.
Therefore, the team developed code that associates everyday 3-d objects
as computing tools, by associates photos of objects taken from a mobile
device with a database representing other&amp;nbsp;objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using an accelerometer data from arduinos and mobile devices (iphones

seismic data and publishes it to a online map using openheatmap.com. The
data is then compared with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USGS&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt; Berkeley Northern California

written by Joel E. Cohen][], a mathematical biologist who heads the
Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University and Columbia
University, titled, “Seven Billion.”  Sandy Leeds, a finance professor
at the University of Texas, summarized some key facts, &lt;a href="http://leedsonfinance.com/2011/11/01/seven-billion/"&gt;in his blog post
on November 6th&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; estimates that our world population reached seven billion
    at the end of&amp;nbsp;October.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our world population has doubled in the past 50 years. We had
    three billion in 1959, four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987
    and six billion in&amp;nbsp;1998.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UN&lt;/span&gt; anticipates 8 billion people by 2025, 9 billion by 2043 and
    10 billion by 2083. India will have more people than China shortly
    after 2020. Before 2040, sub-Saharan Africa will have more people
    than&amp;nbsp;India.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1950, there were nearly three times as many Europeans as
    sub-Saharan Africans. By 2010, there were 16% more sub-Saharan
    Africans than Europeans. By 2100, there will be nearly five
    sub-Saharan Africans for every&amp;nbsp;European.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life expectancy is now 70. The average number of children per
    woman fell worldwide to 2.5. It was five in 1950. The world’s
    population is growing at 1.1% per year, half the peak rate in the&amp;nbsp;1960s.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 1950, for each person 65 and older, there were more than six
    children under 15. By 2070, elderly people will outnumber children
    under 15 and there will be only three people of working age (15 to
    64) for every two people under 15 or 65 and older. We will have
    intense pressure to extend the working age beyond&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Nearly half the world lives on \$2 per day or less. In China, the
    figure is 36%; in India it’s&amp;nbsp;76%.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Approximately 850 million to 925 million people experience food
    insecurity or chronic undernourishment. In much of Africa and
    South Asia, more than half the children are stunted (low height
    for their age) as a result of chronic&amp;nbsp;hunger.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The world produced 2.3 billion metric tons of cereal grains in
    2009-10. This is enough calories to sustain nine to eleven billion
    people. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUT&lt;/span&gt;…only 46% of the grain went into human mouths. Domestic
    animals got 34% of the crop and 19% went to industrial uses like
    biofuels, starches and&amp;nbsp;plastics.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human demands on the earth have grown enormously. (Unfortunately,
    the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents have stayed the same
    size.) Already, more than a billion people live without an
    adequate, renewable supply of fresh&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;About two-thirds of fresh water is used for&amp;nbsp;agriculture.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We’re going to see huge shifts in the geopolitical balance of
    numbers, further declines in the number of children per woman,
    smaller but more numerous households, an increasingly elderly
    population, and growing and more numerous&amp;nbsp;cities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Growth in households can be even more important than pure
    population growth. Each household has energy&amp;nbsp;demands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stats are thought-provoking and really help provide the context for
the future of our world. But, sometimes reading the numbers isn’t
enough. That’s why I wanted to share this great youtube video
infographic created by &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that helps visualize the numbers in a
really creative&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/VcSX4ytEfcE" frameborder="0" width="586" height="320"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was just over two centuries ago that the global population was 1
billion — in 1804. But better medicine and improved agriculture resulted
in higher life expectancy for children, dramatically increasing the
world population, especially in the&amp;nbsp;West.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As higher standards of living and better health care are reaching more
parts of the world, the rates of fertility — and population growth —
have started to slow down, though the population will continue to grow
for the foreseeable&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.N.&lt;/span&gt; forecasts suggest the world population could hit a peak of 10.1
billion by 2100 before beginning to decline. But exact numbers are hard
to come by — just small variations in fertility rates could mean a
population of 15 billion by the end of the&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government team recently partnered with members of the
International Space Exploration Coordination Group (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISECG&lt;/span&gt;) to produce an
infographic for their Global Exploration&amp;nbsp;Roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISECG&lt;/span&gt; describes their effort this&amp;nbsp;way:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;The Global Exploration Roadmap reflects the international effort to
define feasible and sustainable exploration pathways to the Moon,
near-Earth asteroids, and&amp;nbsp;Mars.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Exploration Roadmap discusses in detail a framework for
interagency discussion, mission scenarios, and strategies for long-range
human exploration, we felt it important to represent this information in
an accessible style. Our goal has been to distill the essence of the
Global Exploration Roadmap into a graphic document that contributes to a
conversation that can be had between a 5 and 95 year old. How did we
think we could do this? Quite simply we tried answering &amp;#8220;where are we
going&amp;#8221; with a&amp;nbsp;map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influenced by 1950&amp;#8217;s Disneyland designs, video game visuals, and Peter
Pan Neverland maps, we hoped to describe the complexity of international
space projects with simple highlights. We began development of the
Global Exploration Roadmap infographic by describing it as a treasure
map of&amp;nbsp;sorts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The initial GER sketch." src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/GER_Resources/post/ger01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial mockup included destinations as stylized islands in a
star-filled&amp;nbsp;ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="GER visuals represented as islands in space." src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/GER_Resources/post/ger02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We intended to show dotted paths with X-marks the spot graphics
throughout locations in the solar system. Unfortunately, this style
didn&amp;#8217;t facilitate the amount of information we&amp;#8217;d have to show. In a
later revision we decided to take a similar approach, scaling back the
visual perspective, but chose a more traditional representation of the
solar system. We decided to keep the dotted paths and used them as a
timeline representation of&amp;nbsp;missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;![The Solar System begins to appear as the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GER&lt;/span&gt; infographic is&amp;nbsp;developed.][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After development of the top level design was completed we developed
clickable components, descriptions of missions and locations, and
animated&amp;nbsp;transitions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="A layer of data is added to the interactive GER." src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/GER_Resources/post/ger04.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ve worked hard to develop an information-rich graphic that you can
learn from and share. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISECG&lt;/span&gt; plans to enhance the product in the coming
year, with more information on the global effort.  So here it is. &lt;strong&gt;Just
click the image&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;img alt="View the interactive Global Exploration Roadmap." src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/GER_Resources/post/ger05.jpg" /&gt;][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is committed to developing solutions that strengthen our
international partnerships and contribute to a better world. Like the
Global Exploration Roadmap, this infographic will evolve. We look
forward to your feedback. We think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISECG&lt;/span&gt; says it&amp;nbsp;best:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;By sharing early results of this work with the broader community,
space agencies hope to generate innovative ideas and solutions for
meeting the challenges&amp;nbsp;ahead.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to give an update on both the mission and the
classification tasks.  As you may have heard, &lt;a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1977"&gt;Hurricane Rina&lt;/a&gt; was
threatening the Florida Keys last week, before it was broken apart by a
significant weather system from the north.  During that time, the crew
of Aquarius had just settled in and &amp;#8220;saturated&amp;#8221; with Nitrogen - meaning
they require an oxygen prebreathe protocol before returning to a sea
level pressure.  Since it takes time to prepare for this oxygen
protocol, and hurricane preparations take even more time after that, it
was decided to cut the mission down from 13 days to only seven.  The
crewed portion of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 &lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=290686337617457"&gt;ended last Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, but the citizen
science continued&amp;nbsp;on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In just over a week, over 300 citizen scientists discovered over 12,000
features, and confirmed (or disputed) each others observations over
22,000 times. Crowdsourcing techniques such as these are being
considered in the overall exploration approach, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; plans missions
to distant worlds, including asteroids.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15&amp;#8217;s prime focus was to
practice tools and techniques needed to explore an asteroid, so this was
the perfect venue for this experiment!  During our own beta testing, I
couldn&amp;#8217;t help imagining looking at pictures of an asteroid and planning
a human mission to one, as I examined an endangered coral reef for signs
of delicate&amp;nbsp;life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_5230&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignright&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;300&amp;#8221;

classifications, overlaid on Google Earth image of the ocean.&amp;#8221;][![Small
colored circles associated with classifications, in diagonal&amp;nbsp;rows.][]][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant findings in my opinion (probably since I&amp;#8217;m not a
marine biologist) were the improvements on our exploration technique. 
Almost immediately, the emerging community of virtual aquanauts began
bringing ideas forward to better the interface, improve data flow, and
even take better images of the reef.  Our extremely responsive team at
Vizzuality incorporated many of the suggestions on the spot, while
others are planned for future&amp;nbsp;instances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the community around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-Zooniverse was building, we began
showing the resultant data to the traverse planners and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; engineers. 
Their response was equally as positive and constructive, with the
engineers/geologists who took the images having a great exchange on
photography techniques, and how to resolve exact locations under the
ocean.  Exchanging many of the location-based data sets in Google
Earth-compatible .kml files made visualization easy and straightforward
on multiple platforms.  Since many of the components used in this
project were developed under an open source license, future versions of
this tool will benefit from the contributions of a vibrant developer
community as well.  All in all we&amp;#8217;re extremely pleased with the project
as a whole, and are beginning to discuss the next steps in&amp;nbsp;earnest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To our community of &amp;#8220;virtual aquanauts&amp;#8221;:  &lt;strong&gt;Thanks so much for exploring
with us!&lt;/strong&gt;  Your work here is shaping the path of our future!  Stay
tuned as we wrap up the project in the coming days.  We&amp;#8217;ll continue to
leave the site active and take your classifications, comments and
feedback, and we&amp;#8217;ll report back soon with another update here at
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov"&gt;open.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;. Billed as a conference &amp;#8220;For People Who Make Websites&amp;#8221;,
An Event Apart is unlike pretty much any conference I’ve attended
before. The gist is that you sit in a giant room for 12 hours over two
days listening to the best and brightest from the design, development,
and user experience worlds tell you how to, for lack of a better term,
make your projects incredible. I’ve been a web geek for a long time and
pretty much organize my life in terms of semantic structure, so this
sort of stuff is right up my&amp;nbsp;alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_5195&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;500&amp;#8221;

&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming message throughout the entire event was that the
long-predicted shift in the ways people access the web has happened.
Smartphone and tablet usage has skyrocketed over the past few years and
users are accessing online resources more and more while they are on the
move. However, a website tailored to consumption on a desktop of laptop
doesn’t necessarily translate well to an iPhone. While I’m proud to say
that the entire family of openNASA websites are accessible from pretty
much any modern (or, as we learned, legacy) platforms out there, they
aren’t really optimized to any specific mobile usage. Moving forward,
I’d like to start implementing more elements of &lt;a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/"&gt;responsive design&lt;/a&gt;
into our projects, tailoring the content we present depending on things
like browser&amp;nbsp;width.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_5201&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;aligncenter&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;500&amp;#8221;

Principles" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/jeremykeith.jpeg" title="Jeremy Keith on Design Principles" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, there was a huge emphasis on the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web"&gt;semantic web&lt;/a&gt;. For
those unfamiliar, semantic web is the concept of a “globally-linked
database” – enabling computers to learn what is on a webpage rather than
just the syntax. The video below provides a good summary of the semantic&amp;nbsp;web:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/OGg8A2zfWKg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re just beginning our foray into the semantic web with the recent
launch of our &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/10/12/announcing-the-data-nasa-gov-api/"&gt;data.nasa.gov &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows machine readable
access to metadata about thousands of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; datasets. As we move forward,
we’re looking to use standards such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help describe our data
in more detail so that it is even more accessible and simple to use than
it is&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next few weeks, you’ll see some iteration on the openNASA
family of sites as I integrate some of the lessons I learned from An
Event Apart. Have an idea for how we can improve any of our projects?

&lt;p&gt;There has been a lot of talk about the need for developing social media
policies within government, but little talk about how best to
effectively &lt;span class="caps"&gt;COMMUNICATE&lt;/span&gt; the policy once all the work has been done.
Organizations spend month – even years – discussing, debating, writing,
editing, and reviewing their social media policy before it’s published
for all to see. The end result is usually a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; document or static
webpage that is rarely viewed by the intended audience. Logically, this
makes sense to us – it’s the way we’ve always done things in government.
Why would we do things any&amp;nbsp;differently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, imagine if you could do things differently! Why does your social
media policy (or any policy you develop for that matter) have to be a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt; document on a website? What if you didn’t expect your audience to
download and read a 2000-word document and actually used social media to
communicate your message? What if the way you communicated your policy
was actually&amp;nbsp;engaging?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice in Victoria, Australia is an organization that
really gets what social media is all about. After countless hours
developing their own &lt;a href="http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/socialmedia"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt;, they modeled what it looks like to be a
cutting edge Gov2.0 agency and used social media to communicate their
social media policy! Instead of expecting their staff to read a black
and white document, they produced an amazingly engaging (and colorful)
short video that explains the key elements of their social media&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s truly&amp;nbsp;inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a chance to listen to &lt;a href="http://www.gov2.com.au/2011/speakers/patrick-mccormick"&gt;Patrick McCormick&lt;/a&gt;, who is the General
Manager of Online Collaboration and Digital Engagement in the Strategic
Communication Branch of the Department of Justice in Victoria, talk
about this video and what else they are working on. They are really
innovating on the way business is done in government. I encourage you to
check it out for yourself and listen to this &lt;a href="http://www.gov2.com.au/2011/podcasts"&gt;Podcast&lt;/a&gt; with Patrick
McCormick where he discusses his views on how the Department of Justice
Victoria transformed an internal training video into a YouTube success
with over 32,000 views and what he has to say about Gov 2.0&amp;nbsp;Strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Beyond 140 Characters</title><link href="/beyond-140-characters" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-26T00:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2011-10-26:beyond-140-characters</id><summary type="html">&lt;div id="__ss_9879483" style="width:425px"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an opportunity to talk about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Initiative and
the use of Social Media to engage citizen’s at the &lt;a href="http://www.gov2.com.au/"&gt;Gov 2.0
Conference&lt;/a&gt; early today at the National Convention Center in Canberra,
Australia. The presentation builds on a number of previous presentations
about Open Government and social media at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and continues to explore
how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; can engage citizens in your mission by better understanding on
how to harness the opportunities Open Government presents.   We talked a
lot about how to engaging citizens through the use of Web 2.0 technology
and how government agencies move towards an open and transparent
government.  The presentation covers a lot of best practices from recent
work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/cgerty/"&gt;Chris Gerty&lt;/a&gt; and I have also been experimenting with some video
animation techniques and I used the Q&amp;amp;A portion of today’s talk to recap
the talk with the following video.  It’s still rough, and we’re still
experimenting with the technique, but I think it really turned out&amp;nbsp;well!&lt;/p&gt;

behind-the-scenes access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; hardware and facilities. Participants
are generally chosen by lottery via an open web process and invited to a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; center to watch a launch, share an experience, or get an inside
look at what happens at a center. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; tweetups are anywhere from
several hours to a few days and have included space shuttle launches,
science missions, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; downlinks, mission control - just about every
aspect of spaceflight you can&amp;nbsp;imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of August 2011, over 2,000 participants have been part of official
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetups since the first event at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt; in January 2009. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, in an
attempt to measure the impact of one tweetup, tracked 10,665 tweets
originating from 150 participants in the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/tweetup_jpl_08-04-2011.html"&gt;Juno Tweetup&lt;/a&gt; as well as the
subsequent retweets and found 29.9 million potential&amp;nbsp;impressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That&amp;#8217;s a lot of outreach. &lt;/strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve participated in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetups as a
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; ambassador for events at my own center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-130, first &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; tweetup)
as well as a regular participant at another center. (&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/events/2011/SOFIA_tweetup.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames
Research Center&lt;/a&gt;) Every time I have seen some of the best &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has to&amp;nbsp;offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s exciting about&amp;nbsp;tweetups:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is social media as it is meant to function. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; gets to tell
    their own story without a filter, listen and engage the public
    response, and interact directly with it. Tweetups also create
    community among often isolated followers, connecting them to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
    and to each other - and inspiring projects that aren&amp;#8217;t sustained by
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; but by the community&amp;nbsp;itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An extremely motivated, space-enthusiastic community who are ready
    to engage with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s mission at a whole new level. It&amp;#8217;s amazing to
    be in the company of people who sometimes have a wider knowledge of
    space history and trivia than many of us at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;! I thought I was a
    space geek&amp;#8230; but tweetups give a whole new definition to space&amp;nbsp;geek!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetup community (led by our friend &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonverve"&gt;Jon Verville&lt;/a&gt;) has
    set up their own &lt;a href="http://nasatweet.com/wiki/Main_Page"&gt;community wiki&lt;/a&gt; to share their experiences and
    multiply their impact. They track each tweetup&amp;#8217;s participants,
    schedule, media mentions, and mission references. The wiki also
    includes guides for first time attendeees as well as ways to [stay&amp;nbsp;involved][].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

Because here&amp;#8217;s the reality: [citizen engagement][] means that we are
developing active evangelists and advocates for the space program - not
just passive spectators. When we encourage &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s scientists and
engineers to engage in real conversation with the public, it&amp;#8217;s effective
*communication*. When they understand what and why &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is doing, they
tend to share it with others - and this is creating *relevancy*. As &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
becomes more relevant to people, it builds trust and finds more and more
advocates in the community who care about and want to contribute to the
exploration vision, and this is *inspiration*. And it just keeps going
from there&amp;#8230;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; does.  The agency would like to send a crew to visit an asteroid,
and we&amp;#8217;re not going alone.  In addition to being open to partnerships
that will leverage the skills of space agencies and corporations across
the planet, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is looking at new ways to collectively leverage
expertise of individuals: the science buff, the student, the
oceanographer, the rocket scientist, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; - all working together to
explore our&amp;nbsp;universe!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What techniques can we use to do this?  Today we&amp;#8217;re only scratching the
surface of &amp;#8220;connective&amp;#8221; technologies will be available in the 2020&amp;#8217;s.
 Only 15 years ago, the internet was &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WIntHosts1981-July2011.jpg"&gt;limited&lt;/a&gt; to corporations,
universities and dial-up connections for an elite few.  Now look at your
smartphone, and your television, then the car in the driveway.  Quite a
shift so far.  But what about another 15&amp;nbsp;years&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is looking at technologies that will let the power of our
interconnectedness drive discovery.  Already we have seen how
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing" title="Crowdsourcing on Wikipedia"&gt;crowd-sourcing&lt;/a&gt; open space data can discover new &lt;a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/22apr_zooniverse/"&gt;galaxies&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1782062/citizen-planet-hunters-find-two-planets"&gt;planets&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-05/24/crowdsourcing-a-map-of-the-moon"&gt;make a detailed map of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.  But what if
the power of the crowd could tell an astronaut where to look for
precious metals on an asteroid, or where to find a hidden aquifer on
Mars?  &lt;em&gt;Hold that thought for a&amp;nbsp;moment&amp;#8230;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Thursday, October 20th, after waiting out a tropical depression
which brought serious high winds and rain to the Florida Keys, the 15th
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Extreme Environment Mission Operations (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;) crew is ready to&amp;nbsp;splashdown.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan for &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15&lt;/a&gt; is to send six astronauts, researchers and
habitat technicians to an underwater habitat to live and work for ten
days, just as they would at an asteroid.  But instead of in deep space,
the mission will take place 43 feet underwater at Aquarius, an asset of
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (&lt;a href="http://www.noaa.gov"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), three
miles off the coast of Key Largo.  The goal of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 mission is
to begin to understand how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; may one day explore and operate on
asteroids, using techniques that are orders of magnitude more capable
and efficient than methods we use today. To achieve this goal, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;
mission team is performing a simulated asteroid exploration mission in
the weightless underwater environment using a combination of divers
simulating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVA&lt;/span&gt; astronauts to test the efficiency of different operations
and to collect scientific data. The knowledge generated from this
simulation will help inform cost-effective designs of future space
exploration assets.  Simply put, practicing spaceflight early and often
now, can save huge amounts of money and risk&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s all about the&amp;nbsp;science!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 will leverage the field of marine science to test out new
operational methods with future applicability to space
exploration.  Marine biology science data will be collected from the
coral reefs near Aquarius – a process that&amp;#8217;s comparable to collecting
data at an asteroid. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; science teams will learn from the sampling
techniques and will use this information to develop future concepts
during an asteroid mission.  But the more data that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; collects, the
more time you need to have specialists working on it, right?  Well,
maybe not.  And that&amp;#8217;s why we need your&amp;nbsp;help!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using the power of many to&amp;nbsp;explore&amp;#8230;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the vast amount of data that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; brings back from its
missions is an enormous task.  In order to improve collaboration
internally, as well as engage citizens in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s mission, the Open
Government team is experimenting with different ways to process mission
data quickly.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; OpenGov team has enlisted the help of
established &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; partners &lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/"&gt;Zooniverse&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://vizzuality.com/"&gt;Vizzuality&lt;/a&gt;, who have
pioneered the analysis of large datasets through crowdsourcing, using
the power of elegant interfaces, to engage citizen scientists in the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt; mission.  Using a new platform which takes a square kilometer of
ocean-bottom imagery and parses it out into an easily navigable,
compelling user interface, we humbly ask you to help find scientifically
relevant items, in order to allow us to outline them for a broad
representation of the reef.  Then, traverse planning scientists can then
use this aggegated data to target, or confirm the interest items for
further&amp;nbsp;study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#8217;t do this kind of science on our own.  We need your help
today and again when we send humans beyond the surly bonds of&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spashdown of the crew on Thursday will also mark the official launch
of our beta site at &lt;a href="http://neemo.zooniverse.org" title="NEEMO-Zooniverse Project"&gt;neemo.zooniverse.org&lt;/a&gt;, part of the new
&lt;a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/lab"&gt;Zooniverse Labs&lt;/a&gt; arena.  Please keep in mind that we are still in
beta for the site, and the site may be down periodically.  If you find
this to be the case, check out the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/neemo"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt; mission page&lt;/a&gt; for a while
and come back&amp;nbsp;soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, please tell us your thoughts in the comments, and good&amp;nbsp;hunting!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="asteroids"></category><category term="crowdsourcing"></category><category term="NEEMO"></category><category term="Opengov"></category></entry><entry><title>“Redward of the rainbow”— SOFIA at Ames Research Center</title><link href="/redward-of-the-rainbow-sofia-at-ames-research-center" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-10-14T21:04:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2011-10-14:redward-of-the-rainbow-sofia-at-ames-research-center</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was privileged this week to visit the Stratospheric Observatory for
Infrared Astronomy - or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; - while it was at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames Research
Center&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; is a Boeing 747 built in 1977 that has been modified to
accomodate a 2.5 meter infrared reflecting telescope. This world-class
airborne observatory that will complement the Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel
and James Webb space telescopes and major Earth-based&amp;nbsp;telescopes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying at altitudes up to 45,000‐feet, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; observes from above more
than 99 percent of Earth’s atmospheric water vapor, thereby opening
windows to the universe not available from the ground. The
Cassegrain-telescope with Nasmyth focus, with a 2.7 meter
aluminum-coated primary mirror, weighs approximately 20,000 kg. (Its
operating temperature is 240 Kelvin, or -33 degrees Celsius!) The near-,
mid- and far- infrared cameras and comprehensive set of
spectrometers allow us to see further through the dust into the sky with
access to more of the&amp;nbsp;wavelength.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="SOFIA telescope" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/telescope-e1318640260385-991x1024.jpg" title="SOFIA telescope" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; is a joint program by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DLR&lt;/span&gt; Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und
Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center). Completion of systems installation,
integration and flight test operations are being conducted at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., from
2007 through 2010. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s science operations are being planned jointly
by the Universities Space Research Association (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;USRA&lt;/span&gt;) and the Deutsches
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; Institut (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DSI&lt;/span&gt;) under leadership of the &lt;a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; Science project&lt;/a&gt;
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field near San Jose,&amp;nbsp;Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s cool about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We get unique &lt;strong&gt;science data &lt;/strong&gt;from the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; project. Its unique
    capabilities illustrate how massive stars form in different
    environments by distinguishing physical, chemical, and dynamical
    differences between high and low mass star formation regions. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt;
    data will be used to refine accretion and cooling models of
    circumstellar disks, and to study the kinematics, composition, and
    evolution of disks around low‐mass young stellar objects. It also
    extends our study of exoplanets and their formation. (Go &lt;a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/docs/SofiaScienceVision051809-1.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
    for the science vision statement and &lt;a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/science_cases/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to see some of the
    science cases from the&amp;nbsp;project.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; offers unique &lt;strong&gt;flexibility &lt;/strong&gt;for deployability, resupply, and
    repair. Its scientific instruments can be exchanged regularly for
    repairs, to accommodate changing science requirements, and to
    incorporate new technologies. These instruments do not need to be
    space qualified. Its &amp;#8220;close to home&amp;#8221; status enables &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; to meet
    dynamic needs more quickly and less&amp;nbsp;expensively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOFIA&lt;/span&gt; redefines &lt;strong&gt;collaboration&lt;/strong&gt;. From the beginning, the project
    was designed physically and administratively to foster partnerships
    between educators and scientists in a research environment - across
    international&amp;nbsp;lines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt;, the collaborative online database of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; datasets we
&lt;a href="https://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/30/introducing-data-nasa-gov/"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in August. The data.nasa.gov &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; allows a machine-readable

&lt;p&gt;Are you a college student looking to make a difference in your world…and
beyond? Do you love the idea of using technology make government more
collaborative, participatory, and transparent? Does your childhood dream
of someday working for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; still live&amp;nbsp;on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve answered yes to the above questions, and you&amp;#8217;ll be spending
your 2012 spring semester in either Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, or Houston, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt;, then
read on! The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Initiative is looking for innovative
minds to join our team for one-semester internships at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Headquarters
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Johnson Space&amp;nbsp;Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government&amp;nbsp;Initiative?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Government Initiative is an innovative strategy for changing
how government works. The aim of open government is to take advantage of
the know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of those outside government
institutions to work together with those inside government to solve
problems. Open Government is all about embracing the concept of “open
innovation” – the idea that working in a transparent, participatory, and
collaborative fashion helps improve performance, inform decision-making,
encourage entrepreneurship, and solve problems more&amp;nbsp;effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s OpenGov team, you’ll be working on a number of
projects throughout the agency related to open government activities.
Some examples of projects we’ll have you working on&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborating with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; scientists and engineers across the country
    to help make data from their missions publicly&amp;nbsp;available&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with graphic designers, web developers, and creative artists
    to find ways to showcase &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; initiatives to members of the&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helping guide &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s policy and strategy on Open Source Software&amp;nbsp;development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with partners from Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, and the
    World Bank on &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;Random Hacks Of&amp;nbsp;Kindness&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Writing white papers and briefing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; management on the progress of
    OpenGov activities in the&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blogging about your experience on &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/"&gt;open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.gov&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A huge part of this internship will be self-guidance. Much like Google’s
20% time, we’ll want you to take part of your time here to start your
own OpenGov project. We’ll work with you to find a project you are
interested in and passionate about, then allow you to take the reins and
manage it. In the past, OpenGov interns have created Android Apps using
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data, the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/statusdashboard.html"&gt;OpenGov Progress Dashboard&lt;/a&gt;, and worked on projects
like &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/"&gt;Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetups&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although we have no requirement for a specific major or program for
applicants, &lt;strong&gt;this position will be primarily policy-focused&lt;/strong&gt;. Thus, a
background in public policy, political science, business, or a related
field will be extremely useful. A love for space exploration and an
inquisitive nature are essential, as are self-motivation, strong writing
chops and experience in using web technologies. Additionally, knowledge
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTML&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CSS&lt;/span&gt; and WordPress are desired but not&amp;nbsp;required.&lt;/p&gt;

Commitment to Open Government, showing progress, addressing critiques
and anticipating the next steps in opening the&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some highlights from the Status&amp;nbsp;Report:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is no “Open” button that can be pushed to render the federal
government more open overnight. Creating a more open government instead
requires, as the President has instructed, sustained commitment—by
public officials and employees at all levels of&amp;nbsp;government. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open government is a long-term thing. Our singular goal is to infuse
transparency, collaboration, and participation into every part of
government. It will require every person, every organization, every
agency. Some carry a misperception that OpenGov is a report we&amp;#8217;ve
submitted or a group we&amp;#8217;ve designated for a particular&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Open governmentis a means, not an end. As President Obama has made
clear, greater openness “will strengthen our democracy and promote
efficiency and effectiveness in Government.” These twin goals—a stronger
democracy, a more effective government—have motivated the
Administration’s efforts in this&amp;nbsp;area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aren’t doing this to check another box, or because someone else
thinks it&amp;#8217;s a good idea. We&amp;#8217;re doing this because it&amp;#8217;s a means to do our
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/whats_next.html"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; (and the whole country&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt;, actually) better and
more&amp;nbsp;effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where citizens can observe the workings of government, they become more
invested in what government does. Government openness empowers citizens
as well, as they are more able to express their views about policy
decisions that affect them. Openness makes democracy stronger also by
encouraging government officials to perform better, for where government
is more open, they are more likely to be held accountable for their
decisions, both good and bad. Similarly, a more open government makes it
easier for the media and watchdog groups to expose, and therefore deter,
improper or otherwise undesirable influences on policymakers. In short,
openness enhances democracy by giving citizens a greater voice in what
government does, and promoting government action that advances the
interests of all, not just a privileged&amp;nbsp;few.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is exactly why I am committed to OpenGov at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;: these principles
encourage us to be our best, hold us accountable for what we do, and
give all citizens another pathway into the real work of the government.
These principles create a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; that is the best for every American&amp;nbsp;citizen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

**Why a hackathon dedicated to water?** Water is essential to sustain
life and economic development, yet the number of people without access
to clean water and sanitation remains daunting.

-   2.6 billion without sanitation (of whom 1.1 billion are still
    defecating in the open).
-   Nearly one billion without access to safe drinking water.

Diseases related to unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation are the
biggest single challenges in global public health today.

-   Health studies have shown that 80% of all diseases in the world are
    water-related.
-   Children are especially vulnerable to health risks; the majority of
    the 42,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and
    unhygienic living conditions are to children under five.
-   More children die of diarrhea than of AIDs, malaria and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TB&lt;/span&gt; combined.

The sustainable management of water resources has also acquired a new
urgency in the face a global population expected to reach 9 billion by
2050, increased food demands, and increased hydrological variability
caused by climate change.

-   Irrigation produces around half of the world&amp;#8217;s food and accounts for
    about three quarters of water withdrawals worldwide.
-   Water scarcity will affect at least 30% of the world&amp;#8217;s population in
    2050.
-   Climate change exacerbates flood and drought challenges as it makes
    water resources harder to manage, and increases risk and
    uncertainty.

New ideas, better, open data and innovative tools are needed to respond
to this global water crisis. In search of just that, the World Bank and
partners are joining forces in order to seed a new community of software
developers, designers and water experts to (1) identify critical global
challenges and project specific problems in order to (2) develop
technological tools to help respond to them.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When and where is the WaterHackathon?&lt;/strong&gt; The two-day marathon hacking
event will take place &lt;strong&gt;October 21 – 23, 2011&lt;/strong&gt;, with multiple global
locations bringing together software developers to hack on real-world
water problems.  Confirmed sites include: Bangalore, Cairo, Kampala,
London, Nairobi, Tel Aviv, and Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;. See
&lt;a href="http://www.waterhackathon.org"&gt;waterhackathon.org&lt;/a&gt; for more information on individual&amp;nbsp;sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Twitter, organizers and participants will be sharing real-time
updates using the hashtag &lt;strong&gt;#waterhack&lt;/strong&gt;. Follow &lt;strong&gt;@randomhacks&lt;/strong&gt; and
&lt;strong&gt;@WSPWorldBank&lt;/strong&gt; — join in the&amp;nbsp;conversation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is behind the WaterHackathon?&lt;/strong&gt; WaterHackathon is organized by
the &lt;a href="http://www.worldbank.org/water"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.wsp.org"&gt;Water and Sanitation Program&lt;/a&gt;, along with
technology partners from &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/"&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness&lt;/a&gt; and
dedicated local partner organizations in each event site. Random Hacks
of Kindness is a partnership between Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
and the World Bank.  WaterHackathon is supported by the &lt;a href="http://water.worldbank.org/water/wpp"&gt;Water
Partnership Program&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who can participate in the hacking?&lt;/strong&gt;We invite programmers, software
designers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GIS&lt;/span&gt; specialists, social media experts, graphic designers,
translators, along with experts in water-related issues and water users
to &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/events"&gt;register at rhok.org/events&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can non-hackers get involved?  &lt;/strong&gt;Do you have a water-related
problem that needs solving? &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems"&gt;Share it&lt;/a&gt; with us. We need water experts
and water users from around the world to submit their problems. While
not all these problems will lend themselves to technology solutions, we
believe documenting pressing local water problems is the first step to
breaking down barriers for non-traditional partners. For those problems
that do get solved, we will share the solutions and support teams in
getting their applications deployed. See &lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/problem-definition-category/water"&gt;examples of water problems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few months back, Open.Gov Team Lead, Nick Skytland approached me with
an idea to implement &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/" title="Google - Liquid Galaxy"&gt;Google&amp;#8217;s Liquid Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; project at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.  I was
immediately intrigued by the idea, and set forth researching what would
be involved.  Nick and I collaborated with others at Johnson Space
Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;) to come up with a way to implement our own Liquid Galaxy.
 We also collaborated with people from other &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; centers to come up
with ideas to extend the project&amp;#8217;s functionality, and to apply the same
hardware to other activities.  In the end, we came up with an exciting
eight-display Liquid Galaxy &amp;#8220;immersive cave&amp;#8221; and a number of ideas to
consider for the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, we sought to participate with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; Innovation Team, and
were successful in being selected as one of 20 innovation projects they
wanted to see implemented.  This gave us access to other innovators in
the center, to collaborate with, and better utilize available resources.
 Thankfully, we were able to get an early start on hardware acquisition,
which proved to be the most critical scheduling component for almost all
of the 20 innovation projects.  Over the course of six months or so, we
were able to participate in a variety of innovation activities around
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;, including a Maker Camp, and several innovation project progress
presentations - which gave us great insight into the brilliant minds and
ideas others brought to the 2011 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; innovation&amp;nbsp;effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our project&amp;#8217;s implementation, we collaborated with a variety of
people on different aspects of the task.  During the two day &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/13/nasa-forward-maker-camp-2/" title="NASA Forward - Maker Camp"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Forward - Maker Camp&lt;/a&gt; in August, people from &lt;a href="http://spacelifesciences.nasa.gov" title="Space Life Sciences Directorate"&gt;Space Life Sciences&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/engineering/" title="Engineering Directorate"&gt;Engineering Directorates&lt;/a&gt; joined in with designing an 80/20-based
rack system to mount the hardware vertically.  This particular solution
gave us a configuration that will work for either a &lt;a href="http://www.nas.nasa.gov/Groups/VisTech/hyperwall/"&gt;HyperWall&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_Automatic_Virtual_Environment" title="Immersive Cave Technology"&gt;Immersive Cave&lt;/a&gt; configuration of the Liquid Galaxy.  We also worked
with people from &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/about/people/orgs/" title="JSC People"&gt;Mission Operations Directorate&lt;/a&gt; and the new
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/c3po/home/" title="Commercial Crew and Cargo Program Office"&gt;Commercial Crew &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Cargo Program Office&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;C3PO&lt;/span&gt;) to overcome hurdles we
encountered with system configuration and&amp;nbsp;optimization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get an idea of what we could do beyond Liquid Galaxy, we talked with
a variety of teams involved in graphical simulation projects at
different &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; centers around the country.  Our first conversation was
with the group responsible for &lt;a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/" title="NASA WorldWind"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s World Wind&lt;/a&gt; project at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/" title="Ames Research Center - ARC"&gt;Ames
Research Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=NASA+Ames+Research+Center,+Moffett+Field,+CA+94035&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sll=37.409846,-122.063427&amp;amp;sspn=0.156805,0.139217&amp;amp;vpsrc=0&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" title="Google Map of NASA ARC"&gt;Moffett Field, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who we had met earlier this
year at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/source/" title="Open Source Summit (OSS)"&gt;Open Source Summit&lt;/a&gt;.  We also talked with the &lt;a href="http://vrlab.jsc.nasa.gov" title="Virtual Reality Lab"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;VR&lt;/span&gt;
Lab Team&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/" title="Johnson Space Center"&gt;Johnson Space Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=johnson+space+center&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ll=29.561662,-95.093708&amp;amp;spn=0.042032,0.034804&amp;amp;sll=37.415228,-122.06265&amp;amp;sspn=0.039198,0.034804&amp;amp;vpsrc=0&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" title="Google Map of JSC"&gt;Houston, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who created
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOUG&lt;/span&gt; - a 3D viewing tool used in training for space walks as well as
shuttle and station robotic arm operations.  Finally, we have spent the
most time discussing opportunities with the team responsible for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;,
the &lt;a href="http://gmat.gsfc.nasa.gov/" title="GMAT"&gt;General Mission Analysis Tool&lt;/a&gt;, from &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/" title="GSFC"&gt;Goddard Space Flight
Center&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Goddard+Space+Flight+Center,+Goddard,+Maryland&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ll=38.997308,-76.850824&amp;amp;spn=0.038356,0.034804&amp;amp;sll=38.997308,-76.85149&amp;amp;sspn=0.018778,0.017402&amp;amp;vpsrc=6&amp;amp;t=h&amp;amp;z=15" title="Google Map of GSFC"&gt;Greenbelt, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions with these groups looked at two different possibilities for
machine clustered HyperWall and Immersive Cave implementations.  The
first is similar to Google Earth&amp;#8217;s implementation, where you run the
application on every machine, and have one configured as a controller
that sends data to the rest, and the others receive the controller&amp;#8217;s
state data (position and attitude) and then draw their locations based
on offset values applied to the camera / screen position.  This requires
the software on every machine, and in the case of Google Earth, each
machine is requesting all of its own data from Google over the network -
in our case, eight times the bandwidth&amp;nbsp;usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second option is an innovative solution recently mentioned on
Google&amp;#8217;s Liquid Galaxy page, by one of their three GSoC (Google Summer
of Code) Interns: &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/liquid-galaxy/wiki/GSoC2011_ClusterGL" title="ClusterGL on GSoC 2011"&gt;ClusterGL&lt;/a&gt;.  ClusterGL is basically taking OpenGL,
an open source graphic library alternative to DirectX, and providing its
graphics &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; calls over the network so that other machines can draw the
graphics themselves, without needing application on their machine.  You
can run one copy of the program on one machine, and setup all the rest
to just draw additional screens of data to make the field of view
larger.  So far this technique shows the most promise, because you don&amp;#8217;t
need to adapt an application to talk between multiple copies of itself
on the&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far our project has been met with great interest and enthusiasm on
site at Johnson Space Center.  People just can&amp;#8217;t stop playing with the
Liquid Galaxy, flying around the Earth, Moon, and Mars, looking at all
of the graphic visualizations of the world in an Immersive Cave
environment.  If you are ever at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;, come over to Building 29 and try
it out.  We look forward to working with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and external parties
interested in collaborating on clustered graphical simulation solutions
in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time &lt;strong&gt;you get to participate&lt;/strong&gt;. Not &amp;#8216;you get to read about it,&amp;#8217; or
&amp;#8216;you can carry the briefcase of the real heroes.&amp;#8217; Not &amp;#8216;you get to sit on
the sidelines and clap for other people.&amp;#8217; &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt; can do something
that matters, that contributes to the mission. Participation is one of
the core tenets of Open Government, and one we take very seriously. When
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; creates opportunities for inspired citizens to participate by
contributing their time, talents and resources in meaningful ways, we
improve the flow of ideas and solutions into and out of the space&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I want to share about a great example of real participatory
exploration&amp;#8230; in some of the coolest work that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/"&gt;Analog missions&lt;/a&gt; are a vital part of what we do for exploration. We
have &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/05/11/neemo-an-analog-for-asteroids/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Extreme Environment Mission Operations (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; on the
Florida Coast, the Inflatable Lunar Habitat in Antarctica, the Short
Distance Mobility Exploration Engineering Evaluation Field Tests in
Washington and Arizona, the In-Situ Resource Utilization Demonstrations
in Hawaii, and the Haughton Mars Project in Canada. Each of these sites
enables us to &amp;#8220;make an analogy&amp;#8221; about spaceflight, creating a test
environment that helps us understand how people, equipment, and
experiments might (or might not) work in the extreme environment of a
mission. (Go &lt;a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/newui/blog/viewpostlist.jsp?blogname=analogsfieldtesting"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to read blogs by the Analogs Field Testing team -
most recently the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desertrats/"&gt;Desert &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RATS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we have other analogs too - and one of the best examples is
the &lt;a href="https://bedreststudy.jsc.nasa.gov/cft.aspx"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Bed Rest Study&lt;/a&gt;, hosted in Galveston, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TX&lt;/span&gt;. Head down bed rest
is a good way to mimic a person traveling in space without gravity. This
amazing project demonstrates how much your body, tilted down slightly
with head down and feet up, for 70 days, 24-hours a day, without getting
out of bed, except for limited times for specific tests, is like an
astronaut’s body during the weightlessness of space flight. (Cool,&amp;nbsp;huh?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heather Archuletta&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as Pillownaut, is just a &amp;#8220;regular
joe&amp;#8221; (in her own words) who realized that everyone could contribute to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s exploration mission in a substantive way and decided to go for it
and join the bed rest study. She continues to tell the story of her
experience and increase the awesome all over the country, getting people
excited about space and&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

![bicycling to exhaustion!][]
:   Bicycling to exhaustion&amp;#8230; one of the many tests involved in the
    study!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What originally motivated you to volunteer for the bedrest&amp;nbsp;study?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather:&lt;/em&gt; A co-worker emailed me a link to an article about bedrest
analogs.  The headline was “Go To Bed For Science” or something similar
to that, so I initially thought it was a joke.  I sought more articles
about it, and learned all the physiological changes that occur, and I
was fascinated at how these studies have evolved since the 1960s. 
Really, you can simulate spaceflight in bed?  I loved that idea, of how
we play with gravity. I enjoyed the career I had at the time, but it was
just another &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; job for average tech clients.  When I changed my focus
and went to Johnson Space Center, I was intrigued that just a normal joe
like myself could do something like this for my space agency, even for
all of humanity.  I am a lifelong &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; geek, and I love that their motto
is, “For The Benefit of All.”  It was something higher, something
meaningful, and I felt I had to go for&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did your work there affect/support/engage the space&amp;nbsp;program?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather:&lt;/em&gt; This question makes me laugh inwardly, because I did so
little!  The doctors and scientists who work for the spaceflight
simulations programs are the ones who truly make a difference, and I saw
some of the most dedicated and earnest people I’ve ever met in my life.
It is inspiring to see folks who are absolutely passionate about what
they do for a living, and they never lose sight of their&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than going through their screening process, and &lt;a href="https://bedreststudy.jsc.nasa.gov/apply.aspx"&gt;qualifying as a
healthy non-smoker with naturally strong bones&lt;/a&gt;, my tasks were pretty
minimal.  However, no one before me had ever described the process in
detail as it was happening to them, so that was why I decided
to &lt;a href="http://pillownaut.blogspot.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; along the way.  I was happy to share the medical reality of
space flight with many readers who were very supportive.  I just tried
to be cooperative and positive for the researchers, and now I try to
encourage others to get involved in the program if they are healthy
enough to qualify.  When the first human sets foot on Mars, we will be
able to say, “I did my small part in making that happen.”  I desperately
hope a red planet landing occurs in my&amp;nbsp;lifetime!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many days exactly did you spend in bed for&amp;nbsp;space?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather:&lt;/em&gt; I’ve done three studies for the &lt;strong&gt;Human Test Subject
Facility&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HTSF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;), two of which required tilted bed rest.  In the
first, I was at a -6 degree head-down tilt for 50 days, simulating the
micro-gravity of the space station.  In the second, I was at an 8-degree
tilted-up angle for 14 days to simulate lunar gravity. Hopefully this
data will be used in the Moon and Mars programs, when we further explore
these&amp;nbsp;bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the best part? A favorite&amp;nbsp;story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather:&lt;/em&gt; The best part is definitely the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TIME&lt;/span&gt; you have, and the break
you get from outside life.  You aren’t in your normal routine generating
bills or paying for gasoline!  Someone brings you three meals a day,
does your laundry for you, and you get a massage every other day – it’s
quite surreal.  The&lt;a href="http://pillownaut.com/tests/tests.html"&gt;testing schedule&lt;/a&gt; comes first, of course, but on
days when there are no tests, you have an incredible amount of time on
your hands, which is a rare and precious commodity in&amp;nbsp;adulthood!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SO&lt;/span&gt; much work done, it was incredible; I actually found the bottom
of my email inbox for about the first time in ten years.  In terms of
leisure, I blazed through thirty books that I previously hadn’t had time
to read.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; tends to recruit people who are industrious and able to
keep busy without getting bored.  Some of us were learning languages,
others took classes, and still others brought their art supplies or
instruments.  Many of the participants at the time would all get
together in the common rooms for movie nights, or shared crafts
projects.  I was lucky to be with a fantastic group who were very
friendly and caring; we all still keep in touch through Myspace and&amp;nbsp;Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What there a time you wanted to quit and go home? What kept you&amp;nbsp;going?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather:&lt;/em&gt; Yes, of course. That is human nature when we undertake odd
challenges or out-of-the-ordinary activities.  The very first time I did
a &lt;a href="http://pillownaut.com/tests/tilt.html"&gt;Tilt Test&lt;/a&gt;, I remember thinking, “Oh for heaven’s sake, what have I
gotten myself into?”  It is stunning to lie in a centrifuge or be
strapped into posturography machines, and think “I get to play fake
astronaut!”  There were days when I had some discomfort, but I never
wanted to go home.  I would have stayed at the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; facility longer if I
could&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have some side effects, such as watery eyes and occasional back
aches, and when I got up after my longest stint in bed, my feet were
quite tender.  What kept me going was thinking, wow, astronauts go
through these same steps.  They are the kind of people who don’t give
up, and I won’t either.  I wanted to see if I could make it through
whatever they threw at me, but of course I don’t kid myself that I ever
worked as hard as real astronauts do.  They train for years just to
spend a few days in space.  I learned a lot about what they endure, and
did a great deal of my own research into the space science to which I
was contributing. So it’s a participatory learning&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How else (other than being a test subject) have you gotten involved
with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s mission for&amp;nbsp;exploration? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Heather:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/index.html"&gt;Tweetups&lt;/a&gt;! Honestly, I think they are the single greatest
outreach idea to come along in years.  I’ve been to five &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetups
now, I’ve been a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mascot handler, and helped with media events at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; centers.  Anyone who finds me online can see I am constantly
passing on space news about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; missions.  It was sad to see the
shuttle program end, and it’s difficult to see manned spaceflight face
such an uncertain future due to budget problems or naysayers.  I’ll keep
trying to generate interest in all things space, especially in
children.  My favorite part of continuing my blog all these years has
been when little kids send me questions.  I always think, people their
age are the ones who may walk on Mars, and it’s crucial that we heighten
their awareness of the importance of space&amp;nbsp;travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for sharing your adventures, Heather &amp;#8212; and for helping everyone
get inspired about what we do at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everyone can spend this many days in bed for science, but there is
something that everyone can do. If you are a dreamer, an excite-r, an
explorer, a hard worker, a thinker, we need you to come be a part of
what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;

Transparency and Open Government&lt;/a&gt;, launching the Open Government
Initiative and making openness a high priority for the Administration.
Over the past two years, federal agencies have worked hard to make
information about how government works more accessible to the public, to
solicit citizens’ participation in government decision-making, and to
collaborate with all sectors of the economy on new and innovative
solutions to difficult issues of national&amp;nbsp;importance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In support of the Open Government Initiative, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; released its &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan"&gt;Open
Government Plan&lt;/a&gt; on April 7, 2010, announcing more than 150 milestones
related to integrating Open Government into the agency’s programs and
projects. In April 2011 we released a new &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/infographic.html"&gt;infographic&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/statusdashboard.html"&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; to communicate the progress in becoming more transparent,
participatory, and collaborative. In August, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; created the new
&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov"&gt;http://open.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt; blog to highlight the agency’s Open Government
success stories. The site is a collaborative blog for the open
government community to highlight the ways that transparency,
participation, and collaboration are being embraced throughout the
agency. Earlier this month, in order to improve access to the
ever-increasing number of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; tools and datasets, we created
&lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;http://data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt; – a directory of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; datasets that includes
direct links to more the 1,000 datasets grouped in to &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/30/introducing-data-nasa-gov/"&gt;nine broad
categories&lt;/a&gt;. A stated goal of Open Government at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is to create new
opportunities to directly engage developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and interested citizens in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; space
exploration&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, President Obama signed the &lt;a href="http://www.opengovpartnership.org/"&gt;Open Government Partnership&lt;/a&gt;
declaration - a new, multilateral initiative that aims to secure
concrete commitments from governments to promote transparency, empower
citizens, fight corruption, and harness new technologies to strengthen
governance. An open and good government is much more than releasing
information. It is about harnessing the skills and talents of the
American people, establishing greater collaboration among Federal
agencies, and ensuring that the taxpayers’ money is wisely&amp;nbsp;spent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Government Partnership will strengthen the momentum towards
more open and accountable government that we see emerging around the
globe. By participating in the Partnership, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; will build on the
foundation that we have established through the Open Government
Initiative, and identify next steps toward promoting the President’s
commitment to transparency, participation, and accountability in&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In celebration of the declaration, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is recommitting itself to the
principles that the President announced on his first day in office and
exemplified in our work since then. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will play a key role in the
&lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/us_national_action_plan_final_2.pdf"&gt;United States Domestic Plan&lt;/a&gt; by launching the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/appschallenge"&gt;International Space
Apps Challenge&lt;/a&gt; to help improve public services and promote innovation
through collaboration. The International Space Apps Challenge is an
innovative international collaboration that accelerates the development
of solutions focused on making government better and addressing critical
issues on our planet, including (but not limited to) weather impacts on
the global economy and depletion of ocean resources. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s strategic
plan calls for international collaboration and challenges &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to
explore together by engaging citizens, harnessing the spirit of
innovation, and developing crucial research and technology capabilities
that will be required for us to move beyond low Earth orbit. The
International Space Apps Challenge provides an opportunity for
government to leverage the expertise and entrepreneurial spirit of
citizen explorers to help address challenges of global importance. The
event embraces the concept of &amp;#8216;open innovation&amp;#8217; to improve performance,
inform decision-making, encourage entrepreneurship, and solve problems
more&amp;nbsp;effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently collecting ideas for potential problem statements
related to the International Space Apps Challenge and encourage you to
share your ideas. We look forward to working together to help solve some
of the world’s toughest challenges using space data and&amp;nbsp;technology!&lt;/p&gt;

(on this mission, at least!)
After more than 5 months on orbit, he will join Russian crewmates
Alexander Samokutyaev and Andrey Borisenko as they undock from the
station&amp;#8217;s Poisk module to &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/videogallery/index.html?media_id=96666621"&gt;return to Earth in their Soyuz &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TMA&lt;/span&gt;-21
spacecraft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are set to land in southern Kazakhstan very late tonight, after
their return was delayed a week. (If you saw &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/09/02/i’m-the-highest-person-feelin’-low/"&gt;Ron’s video from last
week&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll remember how he felt about that&amp;nbsp;delay…)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw another of Ron’s videos this week, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMAZING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://blog.ted.com/2011/07/14/the-orbital-perspective-ron-garan-from-the-iss/"&gt;guided tour of the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He recorded a talk for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TED&lt;/span&gt; Global 2011 event sharing the
perspective he had on the earth from space and describing the wide range
of scientific experiments that are run on the station during&amp;nbsp;missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of his personal objectives is to use the unique orbital perspective
to put a focus on the challenges facing our planet. Ron has a strong
belief in the ability of social entrepreneurship and appropriately
targeted philanthropy to solve many of the problems we face here on&amp;nbsp;earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That means you and me – and that means &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of this conviction, Ron started &lt;a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/"&gt;Fragile Oasis&lt;/a&gt;, an
interactive blog that grew into a larger community of shared projects…
and shared vision. The corps of bloggernauts shares their experience on
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; and invites the public to share in their mission to improve and
protect life on earth. Community members can nominate, follow the
progress of, and vote for real projects making a difference in the areas
of communication, community, education, energy, environment, food,
health, peace, research, and&amp;nbsp;water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space exploration has taught us this: &lt;strong&gt;we have one Earth, and we need
to take care of it. &lt;/strong&gt;We face the same issues around the world and 240
miles up — we need clean water, nutritious food, purified air, and
healthy bodies, as well as means to generate and store power to sustain
where we live and work. We need to work together peacefully across
language and culture barriers with fair governance structures, and a
means to promote knowledge through education and scientific inquiry. We
have to make this work on the International Space Station - just like in
diverse communities all around the&amp;nbsp;globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll close with Ron’s own words about why he started the&amp;nbsp;community:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In June 2008, I had the privilege of flying on board the Space Shuttle
Discovery to the International Space Station, the most complex structure
ever built. I was also privileged to conduct three spacewalks during the
fourteen-day&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;During the last one, with my feet anchored in clamps on the end of the
space station’s robotic arm, I was swept in a big arc over the top of
the space station and&amp;nbsp;back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the top of the arc, I was 100 feet above the space station with the
Earth 250 miles&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was absolutely incredible to see this enormous orbiting space
station &amp;#8212;  the tremendous achievement of sixteen diverse nations
working together on Earth to accomplish a goal in&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seeing humanity’s magnificent accomplishment against the backdrop of
our indescribably beautiful Earth 250 miles below took my breath away. I
wasn’t just looking down at the Earth.  I was looking at a planet
hanging in the blackness of&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was very moving to see the beauty of the planet we’ve been given.
But as I looked down at this indescribably beautiful fragile oasis, this
island that has been given to us and has protected all life from the
harshness of space, I couldn’t help thinking of the inequity that&amp;nbsp;exists.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t help but think of the people who don’t have clean water to
drink, enough food to eat, of the social injustice, conflict, and
poverty that&amp;nbsp;exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stark contrast between the beauty of our planet and the unfortunate
realities of life for many of its inhabitants reaffirmed the belief I
share with so many. Each and every one of us on this planet has the
responsibility to leave it a little better than we found&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come learn, act, and make a&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Declared by the United Nations General Assembly in 1999, and celebrated
by hundreds of space agencies, aerospace companies, schools, planetaria,
and museums, World Space Week is the largest annual space event in the
world. World Space Week builds the workforce of tomorrow by inspiring
students, demonstrates visible public support for the space program,
educates the public about space activities, and fosters international
cooperation into space outreach and education. Since 2007, more than 94
nations have participated in more than 2,250 events with more than 1.3
million&amp;nbsp;attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why October 4-10 every year? These dates were chosen to commemorate two
significant events in space history. On October 4, 1957 [Sputnik
I ][]became the first human-made satellite to be launched into outer
space. On October 10, 1967 the United Nations &lt;em&gt;[Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Peaceful Uses
of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies][]&lt;/em&gt; went
into&amp;nbsp;effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 theme for World Space Week is &lt;a href="http://www.worldspaceweek.org/theme.html"&gt;50 Years of Human
Spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;. The first human spaceflight took place on April 12,
1961, when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made one orbit around the Earth aboard
the Vostok 1 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet space program and
designed by the rocket scientist Sergey Korolyov. Since then, 3
sovereign nations have launched humans into space, with many more
partnering and participating. Talk about space history! What&amp;#8217;s going to
happen next? How are you going to be a part of&amp;nbsp;it?&lt;/p&gt;

*This post complements a presentation given at the [2011 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;
Summit][] entitled* [A Case for Bi-lateral Open Source Development: The
Nebula Story and Key Findings from the Open Source Summit][].  *Although
written by an attorney, this post is not legal advice or analysis and
should not be taken as such.*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-top: 1em;"&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a special association with the principles of openness and
transparency characteristic of the open source software movement.
 Signed into law on July 29, 1958 by President Eisenhower, the [National
Aeronautics and Space Act][] created &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and charged it with, among
other things, providing for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof.  Manifestations of this duty can be observed across all of the
Agency’s mission and business functions, from [high resolution
photography][] and reports on [planetary discovery][] to [financial
transparency][] and [independent oversight][].

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-top: 1em;"&gt;

A particularly direct form of this transparency can be seen in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
efforts to release open source software.  In 2003, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; published [a
report][] assessing the formal barriers to distributing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; software as
open source and reviewing the state of open source licenses.
 Subsequently, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; developed an [open source license][] and changed
[relevant policies][] to permit the release of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; software under this
license.  [Several projects][] have since taken advantage of this work
by releasing their code as open source.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-top: 1em;"&gt;

[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; World Wind][], a 3D interactive world viewer and winner of the
[2009 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Software of the Year award][], stands out as a shining
example of the potential impact of open source &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; software.  Used by
citizens, scientists, and organizations such as the European Space
Agency, the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEMEX&lt;/span&gt; (Mexico Petroleum
Company), General Dynamics, World Bank, Sun Microsystems, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, Northrop
Grumman, and the Government of Australia, World Wind has made a
significant impact on increasing public access to geologic data.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-top: 1em;"&gt;

These efforts have validated the benefits inherent to releasing open
source software.  In furtherance of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open source efforts, we are
currently working toward expanding our flexibility to engage in
[bazaar-style][], bi-lateral open development where code is developed
over the Internet in full view of the public from the outset.  This
approach holds the promise of increased software quality, reduced
development costs, accelerated software development cycles, reduced
barriers for public-private collaboration, commercialization of Agency
technology, and a higher rate of technology transfer both to and from
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-top: 1em;"&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s first foray into this area was through the [Nebula Cloud
Computing project][].  Nebula started as a software development effort
in 2008 to create a private cloud computing platform utilizing free and
open source software.  As a corollary of this architectural direction,
the team set about releasing its software under free and open source
licenses to engage a community in expeditiously advancing the state and
capabilities of open cloud computing.  Towards this end, the [Nebula
project worked with policy makers and stake holders across the Agency][]
to enable a construct wherein the team would be able to engage in
ongoing public development of the Nebula software under the Apache 2.0
license.  In this way, the project was able to work with other
interested developers at an early stage, building the software alongside
a diverse array of individuals and organizations.  After taking notice
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s work in this area, [Rackspace open sourced their Cloud Files
platform][].  This act provided the impetus for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and Rackspace to
join their respective efforts under a common banner: [OpenStack][].  The
ensuing public interest in OpenStack has been staggering, with nearly
[1500 individuals][] and [110 organizations][] currently participating
in some way to advance the project.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-top: 1em;"&gt;

Given Nebula and OpenStack’s success, it became apparent that
bazaar-style development held the potential for bringing significant
value to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; projects.  However, the Nebula experience illustrated that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open source policies favor the [cathedral model][bazaar-style] of
development where an isolated group of developers work on a project and
release infrequent iterations at the conclusion of development cycles.
To better understand &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open source posture and to advance open
development as a formal option for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; developers, we held an [Open
Source Summit][] in March at [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames Research Center][].  This event
brought together engineers, policy makers, and members of the open
source community to discuss our existing open source policy framework
and to chart a course toward bi-lateral open source development.  There
were a number of [key recommendations from the summit][], among them:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-left: 1em;"&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Imbue an Open Source-First
Culture.&lt;/span&gt;  Work to promote open source development and release in
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; software projects through project, budgetary, and organizational&amp;nbsp;incentives.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Knock Down Barriers to
Community.&lt;/span&gt; Clarify and reduce barriers to direct &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
participation in open source communities, governing boards, and related
structures.  Clarify contributor license agreement requirements to
facilitate code contributions to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; projects.  Further, clearly
describe restrictions and regulations which are peculiar to the
government, such as the [International Traffic in Arms&amp;nbsp;Regulations][].
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Communicate.&lt;/span&gt; Highly visible
communication about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open source process and projects along with
community management and ongoing fora for discussion will increase
awareness and help more projects explore open source options.
 Activities like the summit, coding contests, hackathons, and similar
events will highlight open source opportunities for internal and
external&amp;nbsp;parties.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;span style="font-weight: bold;"&gt;Deprecate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s License.&lt;/span&gt; The
[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Source Software Agreement][open source license] was developed
in 2003 as a means to enable public release of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; source code.  This
license received Open Source Initiative [approval][], but [has been
criticized][] for potentially hindering code reuse. In 2006, the Open
Source Initiative issued a [report][] on the problem of license
proliferation identifying three&amp;nbsp;consequences:
&lt;/li&gt;
1.  the perception that there are too many licenses,
2.  difficulty arising from license incompatibility,
3.  and the expense of having to read and understand so many varied
    licenses.

&lt;li style="list-style-type: none;"&gt;
Although the report excepts &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s license as necessary due to unique
government constraints, Summit participants suggested that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; should
deprecate this license and re-license previously released software under
a mainstream open source license.  Further, they suggested that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
should approve a subset of mainstream licenses for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; use and
centralize guidance for license selection for new&amp;nbsp;projects.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 2em;"&gt;

In the coming months, the Open Government team along with others
throughout the Agency will work toward implementing these and other
suggestions to expand the open source options available to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
developers.  The benefits of bi-lateral open source development are
undeniable, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is uniquely positioned to inspire the public to
directly participate in building the systems that will enable us to
expand human knowledge of the Earth and propel us deeper into the
recesses of space.

that face human spaceflight. Recently, the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hefd/index.html"&gt;Water and Food Analytical
laboratory&lt;/a&gt; used [&amp;#8220;teamwork, innovative thought, and old-fashioned
scientific detective work&amp;#8221;][] to solve the issue of an increase in total
organic carbon (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TOC&lt;/span&gt;) in the water screened on-orbit. We understand about
using new methods and new processes to figure out the&amp;nbsp;answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we are also taking those answers and applying them to some
innovative &lt;em&gt;problems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://launch.org/forum/1/water"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt;: Water&lt;/a&gt; was held at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Kennedy Space Center in March 2010. 
There the select 10 Water Innovators presented their innovations which
included transformative ideas, technology and research which addressed
water sustainability challenges in areas that included water efficient
vertical farming systems, low cost bacterial water testing, water
contaminant floating sensor network, carbon credit financed water
purification system, electro-chemical arsenic removal system and
evaporation-based underground irrigation technology among&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAUNCH&lt;/span&gt; is a vital example of &lt;a href="http://launch.org/story/30/why-talking-about-and-practicing-innovation-really-does-matter"&gt;why talking about and practicing
innovation really does matter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.waterhackathon.org/"&gt;Waterhackathon&lt;/a&gt; is committed to challenging water experts and
software developers from around the world to co-create the innovative
solutions needed to help solve today&amp;#8217;s water problems. Waterhackathon
will provide open source solutions to resource management, point
monitoring and access mapping, real-time climate comparisons, and more.
This global event will be held in October 2011, offering experts,
software developers, and even entrepreneurs to use open data to address
real problems and make them freely available. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will use the
newly-developed &lt;a href="data.nasa.gov"&gt;data.nasa.gov&lt;/a&gt; to help provide an easily-accessible
repository for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s climate and hydrology&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;

remains an essential resource for the water sector and anyone looking at
the data behind climate change and resource issues. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is providing
technical expertise to world challenges every single&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;[W]e are talking a whole-of-government approach to this issue. Beyond
the State Department, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;, and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MCC&lt;/span&gt;, we are harnessing the
expertise of our technical agencies, the knowledge of the intelligence
community, and the best practices from those who have been working on
these challenges right here in the United&amp;nbsp;States.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One example is a joint &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; initiative to create an earth
observation monitoring and visualization system in the Himalayas. The
glaciers in that mountain range serve as the water tower of Asia,
providing the water supply for more than 1.3 billion people. In
cooperation with nearby countries, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USAID&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; are developing a
system that will provide a clearer picture of water supply and demand
for the region and facilitate efforts to adapt to climate change.”&lt;/em&gt; -
Hillary Clinton in a speech for World Water Day, Washington, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DC&lt;/span&gt;, March&amp;nbsp;2010&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many parts of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; are currently in a &lt;a href="http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/nldas/drought/"&gt;serious drought&lt;/a&gt;. Wildfires
burn through Texas while parts of the Northeast are  still severely
flooded. These events and tools are vital routes for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to collaborate
with unconventional partners, develop new software and hardware, and
apply the results of our research and exploration to some of the most
vital problems facing our fragile&amp;nbsp;oasis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What other issues do you think &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is well-positioned to help&amp;nbsp;address?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

excited to invite &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="mailto:david.j.miranda@nasa.gov"&gt;David Miranda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="mailto:ariel.d.pavlick@nasa.gov"&gt;Ariel Pavlick&lt;/a&gt; to share
about how they are increasing the awesome at their center with
transparency, participation, and&amp;nbsp;collaboration. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Some would say that those struggles are all over, that all the
horizons have been explored, that all the battles have been won, that
there is no longer an American frontier. But I trust that no one in this
assemblage would agree with that sentiment; for the problems are not all
solved and the battles are not all won; and we stand today on the edge
of a New Frontier, the frontier of unfilled hopes and unfilled&amp;nbsp;threats&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;…The New Frontier is here whether we seek it or&amp;nbsp;not.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John F. Kennedy spoke these words at the 1960 Democratic National
Convention in Los Angeles nearly a year before he challenged &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to
send an American to the moon. Over fifty years later these words are
still relevant as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; enters a new era of its history in which we are
being challenged to in many ways start anew, to do things differently,
and to work with new and old partners to achieve our goals. In order to
meet these challenges we need to evolve, embrace change, and most
importantly&amp;nbsp;innovate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Kennedy Space Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;) we have started a group called the
Spaceport Innovators; membership is open to everyone on center and
includes both civil servants and contractors from nearly every
directorate. Our backgrounds are diverse; our drive to innovate and
improve how we do business is&amp;nbsp;common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spaceport Innovators started as a cryptic and, yet, enticing email sent
to a couple dozen &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt; civil servants. In the email, we were challenged
to brainstorm a new and different way to think about our Center.  From
the facilities, organizations, partnerships, geography, launch vehicles,
and market competition: everything was on the table. How could we make
the best space center today, for the next program and for the next 50
years, as our budget and programs&amp;nbsp;fluctuated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We agreed we need to maintain the unity, technical skills and
perseverance that the workforce embodied at the end of the Shuttle
program, but we additionally need to retool our skills and make them
relevant not just for the technical challenges ahead but for the
organizational and cultural whiplash we anticipate as we move to a new
era in Space Exploration. Quickly, our focus moved from what the
facilities need to look like, to what our organization and culture need
to&amp;nbsp;embrace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also realized that to truly innovate we will need to have a greater
diversity of thought. Innovators are not just a select group of people
chosen by management. The entire Center needs to be included, and so we
became more open. Our meetings are now advertised in the Center Daily
News and our website is open to all of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. And so from these
beginnings an informal organization has been formed around disseminating
information, rethinking how we work, and dreaming about the future of&amp;nbsp;spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Vision and Mission are&amp;nbsp;simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Vision:&lt;/span&gt; To think beyond
the norm and improve the way we do things at Kennedy Space&amp;nbsp;Center&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Mission&lt;/span&gt;: To foster
innovation and lead change through collaboration, communication, and
knowledge sharing. Spaceport Innovators will serve as an incubator for
innovative ideas and help launch them towards&amp;nbsp;success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We meet about twice a month and discuss a variety of topics that can be
of interest to our community. Topics such&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;innovation success stories like Project Morpheus and the Max Launch
    Abort&amp;nbsp;System,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;technology demonstrations like the Harris Corp. Force Feedback
    Robotic&amp;nbsp;System,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;introductions to resources that innovators can use such as Space Act
    Agreements and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KSC&lt;/span&gt;’s Technology Integration&amp;nbsp;Office,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;sources of funding and partnership opportunities like the Center
    Innovation Fund and the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; EPSCoR (Experimental Project to
    Stimulate Competitive Research) program,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;even long term far reaching and future looking topics like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DARPA&lt;/span&gt;
    100 Year Starship Study and a proposal for a Network of Ground and
    Space-based&amp;nbsp;Spaceports.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future we hope to find and push forward the innovative ideas that
exist at all corners of our Center. We want to help accelerate the
successful development of intrapreneurial and innovative teams by
providing them an array of support resources through our network of
contacts. We also want to better connect with other groups like ours
across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, share our ideas, and learn more from the many other
innovative thinkers across the&amp;nbsp;Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kennedy ended his famous 1960 speech with words that still echo&amp;nbsp;today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“That is the choice our nation must make &amp;#8212; a choice that lies between
the public interest and private comfort, between national greatness and
national decline, between the fresh air of progress and the stale, dank
atmosphere of &amp;#8220;normalcy,&amp;#8221; between dedication or&amp;nbsp;mediocrity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;All mankind waits upon our decision. A whole world looks to see what we
shall do. And we cannot fail that trust. And we cannot fail to&amp;nbsp;try&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Station heard that their return home will be postponed from September
8th to an anticipated landing on September 16th due to the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition28/p44_launch.html"&gt;failure&lt;/a&gt;
of a Russian Progress cargo vehicle on August 24th. Although I don’t
think anyone would disagree with the fact that space travel is pretty
much the most incredible opportunity anyone on this planet can have, I
can imagine that, after six months onboard the Station, one must get a
little&amp;nbsp;homesick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronaut &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/astro_ron"&gt;Ron Garan&lt;/a&gt; is no exception - his departure delay has given
him a stroke of orbital blues. The most fascinating thing to me about
his latest video from space is not his musical talents (sorry, Ron) but
rather the incredible view it gives of the International Space Station,
courtesy Astronaut &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/astro_aggie"&gt;Mike Fossum&lt;/a&gt;. The massive size of the interior of
the station never ceases to shock me.  Take a&amp;nbsp;look:&lt;/p&gt;

compiled vast amounts of digitized data that has helped us better
understand Earth, other planets in our solar system, and the depths of
space through the eyes of satellites, telescopes, robots, and through
the cameras of astronauts. With each passing decade, advances in
technology made images clearer, the information coming back from space
richer, and the world&amp;nbsp;smaller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a long history of placing large amounts of data online for
members of the public to use. Since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s inception, the agency has
publicly archived all of its data received from spacecraft projects,
including over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4TB&lt;/span&gt; of new Earth Science data each day, and continues to
make a large amount of this raw data open for public&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s commitment to open data expands the audience for the vast body of
knowledge captured in nearly 100 years of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;U.S.&lt;/span&gt; aeronautics and space
data. Developers, technologists, entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and
many others can contribute directly to the exploration of space and
Earth by helping to create new ways of looking at this data.
Additionally, by releasing information about administrative and
procedural information within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, researchers and analysts can
understand more about the inner-workings of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as well as allow our
own employees to better understand other functions of our&amp;nbsp;Agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a lot of data.&lt;/em&gt; For example, just one mission – the &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov/earth-observing-system-data-and-information-system-eosdis/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s
Earth Observing System Data and Information System (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EOSDIS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; – has
stored more then 3 petabytes of data since 2005 in a geographically
distributed mass storage system. This is the same amount as the
estimated total data size of the &lt;a href="http://www.loc.gov/index.html"&gt;Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EOSDIS&lt;/span&gt; is now
downloading more than 7,000 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; a&amp;nbsp;week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open"&gt;Open Government Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, the agency is working to
improve accessibility to this data and incentivizing the use of
government data by citizens. In 2010, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; provided three new datasets
and 18 other tools, widgets and catalogs to &lt;a href="http://www.data.gov"&gt;Data.gov&lt;/a&gt; – but that was
just a&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To address the ever-increasing amount of tools and data catalogs that
are publicly available on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s many websites, we have created this
directory of publicly available datasets. &lt;/strong&gt;The Open Data project, which
is part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Initiative, is intended to improve
access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data. This &lt;a href="http://data.nasa.gov"&gt;open data catalog&lt;/a&gt; is a continually-growing
listing of publicly available &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; datasets and includes information and
direct links to more the 500 datasets, and this is just a small
beginning. We&amp;#8217;ve initially grouped the data into 9 broad categories and
have generously used tags to make the directory&amp;nbsp;searchable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #00ccff;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aeronautics:&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;span style="color: #000000;"&gt;Data related to the study, design, and
manufacturing of flying&amp;nbsp;machines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #808000;"&gt;Earth Science:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Earth science

everyone to help us identify additional high-value datasets to add to
the directory.  Most importantly, by providing access to government data
archives, we hope that citizens will be able to add value to raw data
through the development of new mobile and web applications that re-use
public data in innovative ways. We encourage you to explore and leverage
the &lt;em&gt;zettabytes&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; raw open data and share with us what you
discover and&amp;nbsp;create!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Citizen Engagement</title><link href="/citizen-engagement" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-26T11:52:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2011-08-26:citizen-engagement</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A core premise of the Open Government Initiative is &lt;em&gt;citizen
engagement&lt;/em&gt;. But what does this really mean and why is this so&amp;nbsp;important?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A great definition of &lt;em&gt;citizen engagement&lt;/em&gt; is simply &lt;strong&gt;allowing all
individuals to contribute and participate&lt;/strong&gt;in our mission. At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we
have a term for this – “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Participatory Exploration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.” It is
fundamentally about making the whole enterprise of space exploration -
research and development, science, discovery, and human exploration -
&lt;em&gt;participatory&lt;/em&gt; and unleashing the human spirit of innovation. 
Importantly, participatory exploration does not just commit us to
connect with the public, but also charges us to engage our workforce &amp;#8212;
people who work for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; are citizens too, and have a vital role to&amp;nbsp;play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Charlie Bolden recently stated: “&lt;em&gt;The President is asking us to
harness that American spirit of innovation, the drive to solve problems
and create capabilities that is so embedded in our story and has led us
to the moon, to great observatories, and to humans living and working in
space, possibly indefinitely. That American ingenuity is alive and well,
and it will fire up our economy and help us create and win the future&amp;nbsp;now.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This all starts with a conversation. Let me&amp;nbsp;explain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; opens its doors and encourages its own scientists and
engineers to engage in a &lt;strong&gt;two-way conversation&lt;/strong&gt; with citizens, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
exploration mission is shared on a very personal level.  This is
effective &lt;strong&gt;communication&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s message is effectively shared with citizens, they are more
inclined to share the message with others.  This is building
&lt;strong&gt;relevancy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; becomes more relevant to citizens, we build trust and gain
advocates who are personally invested in space exploration and desire to
contribute to the space program. This is &lt;strong&gt;inspiration&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; creates opportunities for inspired citizens to participate by
contributing their time, talents and resources in meaningful ways, we
improve the flow of ideas and solutions into and out of the space
program.  This is &lt;strong&gt;innovation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; acts on these innovations, and collaborates with citizens to
solve our toughest challenges, new strategic partnerships are formed,
which accelerates innovation, preserves resources and saves money.  This
exponentially multiplies &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;strong&gt;impact&lt;/strong&gt; on the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; intentionally communicates, inspires, and innovates in
a relevant way, students notice and strive to participate so that they
can join in the exploration of new and unexplored frontiers.  Their
spirit of innovation is ignited and results in a renewed drive to pursue
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; education &lt;em&gt;– which is vital for our country’s &lt;strong&gt;future&lt;/strong&gt; success&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participatory Exploration is vital to building a community of connected,
educated citizens ready to invest in and advocate for exploration. It is
a strategic investment our nation must make if we truly desire to
out-innovate, out-educate, and out-build our competitors and create new
capabilities that will take us farther into the solar system and teach
us more about our place in it.  Through the Open Government Initiative,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is committed to engaging citizens in our space exploration&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;

Virginia, hurricanes headed to New York, a month of 100+ degree days
across Texas. What&amp;#8217;s going on with the world&amp;#8217;s weather? Do you want to
know more than what you get from the evening news weather&amp;nbsp;report?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a whole page of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/main/index.html"&gt;hurricane resources&lt;/a&gt; to track developing

presented her most recent work at &lt;a href="http://tedxnasa.com/"&gt;TEDxNASA&lt;/a&gt; in San Francisco.  In the
coming months, her new documentary film “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/16/we-want-your-thoughts-on-connected-an-autoblogography/"&gt;Connected: An Autobloggraphy
about Love, Death and Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;” will start to rollout nationwide. 
The OpenGov team had the fortunate opportunity to talk to Tiffany about
what it means to live in an interdependent world and she really got us
thinking about the interdependence of technology, culture, and the world
as we know&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Tiffany pointed out, &lt;strong&gt;the single most important thing about
technology is that you can turn it off&lt;/strong&gt;.  Think about that for a
minute.  When is the last time you unplugged?  Have you ever unplugged? 
Do you &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEED&lt;/span&gt; to&amp;nbsp;unplug?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unplugging is a noble goal. But here’s the challenge: &lt;em&gt;it seems almost
impossible to do&lt;/em&gt;.  It’s clear that we are rapidly being overcome by the
realities of living in the information age and for many, being
hyper-connected is a fundamental survival technique. To prove her point,
Tiffany asked the TEDxNASA for a show of hands of how many people
regularly unplug one day every week.  Out of the hundreds of people in
attendance, two people raised their hands!  Most people just laughed it&amp;nbsp;off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The amazing thing that happens when you unplug is that time slows
down&lt;/strong&gt; and you are “&lt;em&gt;more present&lt;/em&gt;.” This is something that is becoming
much more important in my own life as my wife and I start to raise our
family.  There just doesn’t seem to be enough time in the day to do
everything I did before, and invest in my family.  At the end of the
day, my family is much more important and the idea of slowing down time,
and being more present, is incredibly&amp;nbsp;attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I also had an opportunity to watch &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ThisIsSethsBlog"&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt; present
about a very similar topic.  Shortly thereafter he published a blog post
called&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;the filter hierarchy&lt;/em&gt;” which really scopes the the problem we
face today.  I’ve cross-posted his article below and would love to know
what you&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2011/08/the-filter-hierarchy.html"&gt;The Filter&amp;nbsp;Hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333399;"&gt;There&amp;#8217;s more information, provocations,
riffs, causes, meetings, opportunities, viral videos, technologies and
policies coming at you than&amp;nbsp;ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333399;"&gt;So, how do you rank the incoming? How do
you decide what to expose yourself to&amp;nbsp;next?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333399;"&gt;Email from your&amp;nbsp;boss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333399;"&gt;Three or four recommendations from
    trusted colleagues, each with the same&amp;nbsp;link&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333399;"&gt;A trending topic on&amp;nbsp;Twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #333399;"&gt;Which of these are required reading for a
productive member of society or a good employee or an informed citizen?
Which do you do out of habit? Are you assuming that your habits are the
norm, and that others have an obligation to pay attention to what you
pay attention to? Should there be symmetry&amp;#8212;is it logical to only engage
with people who prioritize their filters the same way you&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Sundance documentary &lt;a href="http://connectedthefilm.com/"&gt;Connected: An Autoblogography about Love, Death &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
Technology&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsummit/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Summit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In “&lt;em&gt;Connected&lt;/em&gt;“, &lt;strong&gt;Tiffany Shlain&lt;/strong&gt;, award-winning filmmaker and
founder of The Webby Awards, traces interdependence througha history,
discovering surprising links between right brain and left; honey bees
and stress; hormones and happiness; technology and nature; progress and
consequences; and parents and children. The result: a personal film with
universal&amp;nbsp;resonance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you liked the film, you can also see Tiffany speak at tomorrow&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://tedxnasa.com/silicon-valley/speakers/"&gt;TEDxNASA@SiliconValley&lt;/a&gt;, which will also be streamed online &lt;a href="http://tedxnasa.com/silicon-valley/live-stream/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want to know how &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; enjoyed the film and what &lt;strong&gt;your&lt;/strong&gt; thoughts
are on how it relates to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s continually growing exploration of
collaborative technologies. We&amp;#8217;d love to have a discussion in our
comments on this topic and other ideas from the themes seen in the film.
Some potential areas for&amp;nbsp;discussion:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How does collaboration at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mirror the idea of connectedness
    shown in the film? Can our ten centers be seen as the trees in the
    forest with a common system of&amp;nbsp;roots?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There was a large emphasis in the film on the impact &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has had on
    both the filmmaker and the world. What ability does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; have to
    influence collaboration and inspiration on others? How can we, as an
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; organization, contribute to&amp;nbsp;this?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How do you as an individual feel you fit in with the bigger mission
    of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;? How do you see yourself as critical to our&amp;nbsp;success?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perhaps most importantly: did you like the film? What thoughts do
    you have on the creator&amp;#8217;s life adventure and her way of illustrating
    it to the viewer? Would you like to see more of these types of
    screenings at future &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;events?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

We look forward to talking with you about the film and hearing your
thoughts, ideas, and feedback! Use the comment fields below to discuss

proposed for next year’s &lt;a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive"&gt;South by Southwest&lt;/a&gt; festival in Austin. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;
is a community-driven event and voting accounts for 30% of the
decision-making process for any given programming slot. The selection
process is extremely competitive and this year there are 3600 proposed
panels, of which only 500 get selected. The more votes we submit for the
space panels, the more likely a panel related to space exploration will
be included in the final SxSW program. Voting ends on Friday, September
2 (11:59 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CST&lt;/span&gt;), so please vote &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you out, we’ve put together a directory for all the space
related panels. This includes panels that have &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; representation as
well others that may not necessarily be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;affiliated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to change the world? Then get a license to RHoK! Random Hacks of
Kindness (RHoK) is a global initiative to create practical open source
solutions to humanity&amp;#8217;s toughest challenges. Organized by Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo!, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the World Bank, RhoK brings together
thousands of the best and brightest developers from around the world -
like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; - to participate in fast–paced and competitive marathon coding
events resulting in real applications that are making an impact on
humanity. The RHoK community has grown rapidly over the past 2 years,
with 3000 participants from 43 cities who have worked on 214 distinct
solutions. This talk will bring together &amp;#8220;RHoKstars&amp;#8221; to provide an
overview of the initiative, discuss some of the solutions developed,
describe how the SxSW community can contribute to the effort and most
importantly, brainstorm about what is next. …and if they let us, we&amp;#8217;ll
be playing rock music and lighting off&amp;nbsp;fireworks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Want to make some money? Federal agencies have recently been given the
authority by Congress to sponsor competitions for individuals, groups,
and companies to develop new ideas and technology innovations for a
chance to win potentially lucrative prizes. These competitions can range
from new mobile outreach technologies to web-based data analytics tools
to even vehicle-to-vehicle communications; the government is looking for
breakthrough technologies from the minds of the most innovative and
forward thinking Americans, many of whom are at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SXSW&lt;/span&gt;. This session will
highlight some of the coolest prizes for technology development that the
government has been involved in to date, including the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOT&lt;/span&gt;’s Connected
Vehicle Challenge, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Source and blue button projects, and
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s centennial challenges. Additionally you will learn about some
prizes government did &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; play a role in to explore what role the
government should be playing in these activities moving&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some interesting prizes that the government has been
    involved&amp;nbsp;in?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the role of prizes in stimulating technology&amp;nbsp;development?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do prizes mean to the attendees of SXSWi and how do they get&amp;nbsp;involved?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When should the government &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; use&amp;nbsp;prizes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the trends in government sponsored prizes that we should
    expect to see in the near&amp;nbsp;future?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nation&amp;#8217;s space agency and the world&amp;#8217;s largest museum and research
complex have embraced the use of social media to reach out, engage new
audiences, engage existing audiences in new ways, and give the public
behind-the-scenes access. This conversation with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the
Smithsonian&amp;#8217;s Air and Space Museum will explore successes and failures
in these new ways of engaging and solicit your input for new
opportunities they have yet to&amp;nbsp;try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What ingredients have been successful for new ways &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the
    Smithsonian&amp;#8217;s Air and Space Museum are&amp;nbsp;engaging?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What new strategies or tools do you think would be most important to
    build engagement? Are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the Air and Space Museum overlooking
    a great&amp;nbsp;opportunity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How has &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; managed to successfully partner with Gowalla,
    Foursquare, SlideShare and&amp;nbsp;more?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are some of the barriers to social media adoption at government
    agencies and&amp;nbsp;museums?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the constraints? Which barriers can be overcome (sometimes
    through creative solutions) and which&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Niburu! Comet Elenin! Asteroid &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YU55&lt;/span&gt;! It&amp;#8217;s not the end of the world,
really. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and Discover&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Bad Astronomer&amp;#8221; Phil Plait are here to
explain why. This panel discussion will take on the Internet factor in
the cause and cure of 2012 hysteria. We&amp;#8217;ll look at how urban legends
spread, data gets shared and myths get debunked online. See the
Web-based tools the Near-Earth Objects office at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s Jet Propulsion
Laboratory uses to keep an eye on asteroids and comets (and let you know
about them), and how the amateur astronomy community is helping in the
effort to track low-flying space rocks. The Bad Astronomer himself
shares rumor-slaying tales from behind the scenes of his popular blog.
The sky isn&amp;#8217;t falling, but misconceptions are. Join&amp;nbsp;us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Will the world end in&amp;nbsp;2012?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will I know when an asteroid is headed near&amp;nbsp;Earth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What asteroids and comets *are* headed near&amp;nbsp;Earth?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I help keep track of low-flying comets and&amp;nbsp;asteroids?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not unlike a zombie horde ready to devour red tape and uninspired
project managers, this enthusiastic movement sees brains as valuable
assets to take over the world. Learn why these people got so
passionately involved in space, how they became good friends over the
Internet, and what they’ve created to make measurable change toward a
more awesome tomorrow. While established membership organizations
struggle to survive, these Internet-enabled groups are flourishing with
new members from far outside traditional demographic lines that are
creating large-scale activities. If you don’t already know a space
tweep, learn why you&amp;nbsp;will&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are these groups finding success where traditional membership
    based groups are&amp;nbsp;struggling?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What strategies are used to give the community “ownership” and
    empower them to go out and do great&amp;nbsp;things?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I need to vanquish some ignorance &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; ignite some passion for
    exploration. How do I make my own science&amp;nbsp;army?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you turn excitement about an idea into projects that
    actually influenced space&amp;nbsp;exploration?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not rich or bored. Where do you get the time, funding &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;
    resources to make these things&amp;nbsp;happen?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/12160?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F10%2Fname%3Aspacebits"&gt;6. Spacebits: Awesomeness, Balloons, Space and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DIY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slightly over a year ago we had this idea of trying to launch a ballon
into the stratosphere (\~100,000 feet) with a couple of cameras and get
it back down safely. Since then we&amp;#8217;ve launched 6 balloons and
successfully recovered all of them. We learned a lot in the process: how
inert gases cannot explode but can instead make other things explode,
how to calculate volumes and weights appropriately to attain the desired
height before the descent, how dropping the payload in salted water can
be harmful for the cameras, how to put more and more sensors in the
payload and still have it lift off, and how ideas that sometimes seem
brilliant may cover hidden dangers (and extremely ridiculous moments).
We have also managed to gather dozens and dozens of people around this
movement, up to the point of having 12 cars with 5 people each and lots
of gear running after 3 balloons simultaneously. And did we tell you
running away from wild animals? Apart from telling (and showing) you all
these things, we will also unveil our ideas for the future and answer
your questions if you&amp;#8217;re planning to launch a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAB&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I assemble an high altitude balloon and send it to&amp;nbsp;space?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the hazards and challenges for sending equipment to&amp;nbsp;space?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What if your computer and cameras dive into the&amp;nbsp;ocean?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the procedures from end to end until the launch&amp;nbsp;countdown?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the legal requirements and implications of a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAB&lt;/span&gt; in your&amp;nbsp;country?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With 110 twitter accounts, 20 tweeting astronauts, an Image of the day
posted to Facebook and more, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s social media strategy is all about
extending the space &amp;#8220;experience&amp;#8221;. For the last shuttle launch of
Atlantis, 150 lucky individuals were invited to attend the official &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Tweetup to experience the lift-off first-hand, with exclusive behind the
scenes access to astronauts, facilities, lectures and more. Hear from
Erik Sowa, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Tweetup attendee and director of engineering at
ExactTarget&amp;#8217;s Social Media Lab, and Stephanie Schierholz, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s head of
social media, as they discuss the process behind this groundbreaking&amp;nbsp;event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to translate passive bystanders into actively engaged fans and&amp;nbsp;followers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to tie social and physical experience&amp;nbsp;together&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How get social media buy-in across large diverse&amp;nbsp;organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to manage high volume interactions across different topics,
    platforms,&amp;nbsp;communities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to keep your social momentum going after the big event (liftoff!&amp;nbsp;landing!)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship most adults have with science is one of observation:
watching government agencies explore on behalf of us, but not actually
exploring it ourselves. Science should be disruptively accessible –
empowering people from a variety of different backgrounds to explore,
participate in, and build new ways of interacting with and contributing
to science. By having a fresh set of eyes from those who solve different
types of problems, new concepts often emerge and go on to influence
science in unexpected ways. A grassroots effort called Science Hack Day
aims to bridge the gap between the science, technology and design
industries. A Hack Day is a 48 hour all-night event that brings
different people with good ideas together in the same physical space for
a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking, and building ‘cool
stuff’. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period,
small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable&amp;nbsp;results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is hacking actually contributing to&amp;nbsp;science?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not a developer, what can I&amp;nbsp;do?&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What types of things can I make with&amp;nbsp;science?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can scientists and non-scientists really&amp;nbsp;collaborate?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can I create a Science Hack Day in my&amp;nbsp;city?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/ideas/view/10551?return=%2Fideas%2Findex%2F10%2Fname%3Aspacepoints"&gt;9. SpacePoints: Space Outreach at Ludicrous&amp;nbsp;Speed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s budget was drastically cut and the commercial aerospace
industry found itself in charge of getting man into space, a group of
&amp;#8220;space geeks&amp;#8221; consisting of web developers, aerospace scientists and
engineers, and people who have a dream of living in space started
meeting up and designed the rules, developed the application, and are
sharing Space Points and are increasing awareness publicly about space
policy, increasing funding to aerospace-related research (commercial and
government), and having fun playing to&amp;nbsp;win!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Questions&amp;nbsp;Answered:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did the process for crowdsourcing the inital concept and rules
    behind SpacePoints&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you manage the development of the core platform with a team
    working&amp;nbsp;remotely?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What success/case studies can you share around an increase in
    engagement and education around space-related topics in America and
    Globally as a result of&amp;nbsp;SpacePoints?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did you maintain a unified core vision with so many different
    projects and people coming together to add to&amp;nbsp;SpacePoints?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can other organizations replicate this to increase their
    outreach&amp;nbsp;programs?&lt;/li&gt;

to engage the workforce in fast, hyper local projects that advance
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission and vision. The event provides a chance to pursue
projects of value to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mission that might not normally be done
and also to collaborate with others from around the agency who are doing
interesting work in diverse fields. Based on the “maker” culture, Maker
Camp makes hands-on creating and experimenting accessible to all parties
and incubates innovative thinking and &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;. Johnson Space Center and
Ames Research Center recently partnered to hold the third such event,
the first to allow other centers to participate remotely. Highlights of
this Maker Camp included the projects and teams, the remote
participation, and the use of a variety of collaborative&amp;nbsp;spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diverse local projects addressed by short-term teams: &lt;/strong&gt;12 projects
were submitted for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARC&lt;/span&gt; Camp, including ideas around hardware,
software, process improvement, and website development. Only a few had
been prepared by the event leadership; many were contributed day-of by
participants across centers. All project progress was documented via
wiki so that teams can continue to work on their chosen projects at
later dates or pass on the work to others. While many were more
self-contained, a few of the projects were able to provide catalytic
contributions to longer-term, ongoing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Maker Camp projects" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/projects-199x300.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of collaborative platforms:&lt;/strong&gt;The event used AdobeConnect to
collaborate virtually with others at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARC&lt;/span&gt; and Goddard, allowing everyone
to provide real-time feedback and cross-pollination from different
centers and disciplines. The tool was very effective with audio, video,
chat, and screen sharing capabilities, and allowed the varied projects
to see each others’ work and the participants to ask questions&amp;nbsp;continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Adobe Connect at Maker Camp" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/intern-300x199.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use of collaborative spaces:&lt;/strong&gt; The collaborative spaces proved ideal
for the diverse teams to work together, in the main collaborative sp.ace
as well as the Sandbox (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;’s new Innovation Design workshop/fabrication
space.) (See &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/07/28/working-outside-the-box-at-johnson-space-center-a-cross-post-from-ask-magazine/"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;for more on collaborative spaces at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; and
across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.) One of the projects even included advancing the
development of a new collaborative space at another&amp;nbsp;center.&lt;/p&gt;

learned to love working in this type of environment.  Get out of your
office and co-locate to work with your colleagues.  Share ideas and help
each other look at problems differently, brainstorm solutions, or maybe
even just practice that big presentation in front of an unbiased pair of
eyes. By discussing issues with folks who don’t have your same
perspective, it seems easier to be confident in the right solution to
problems faster.  Connecting also seems less deliberate and more
natural.  It takes full advantage of face-to-face&amp;nbsp;interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let’s face it, collaboration is only useful if everyone you connect
with is in the same city, or can afford the time away from family and
other responsibilities to work face-to-face.  Alas, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; transporter
is still under development… But do you really need&amp;nbsp;one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking beyond the common physical location of collaborators, how can we
create these same experiences &lt;em&gt;virtually&lt;/em&gt;?  Is it as simple as asking
your local college student about the latest social media tool?  How can
we deliberately foster online collaboration and retain the great
qualities of a face-to-face experience?  What approach can be taken to
avoid the risk of a virtual space feeling phony and creating unnecessary&amp;nbsp;barriers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An article in this month’s Harvard Business Review discusses the concept
of three essential “affordances” of successful collaborative spaces:
&lt;em&gt;Proximity&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Privacy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Permission&lt;/em&gt;.  As surprising as it is
logical, the article suggests that these affordances are equally
important in the design of a physical or a virtual space, and each
should be balanced regardless of the venue or&amp;nbsp;medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But seriously, comparing these three affordances against the thousands
of online tools and platforms… The technology changes so quickly that
there isn’t one design to copy, or one model to follow.  So let’s take a
different approach: looking at some real-world examples, can we infer
some virtual-world guidance?  If we focus on function we might be on to&amp;nbsp;something…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proximity&lt;/strong&gt;:  In the real world this is the coffee cart that you pass
on the way from the parking lot.  It’s easy to get to, always open when
you need it, and most of the time there’s someone you know nearby.
Virtually is there a “place” that online participants go that has some
of the same qualities?  For years, email has been that “place”, required
to use for document exchange but just as effective to organize a
birthday celebration with colleagues.  But just as coffee carts get
crowded and prices go up, email inboxes became cluttered with reply-all
threads and authentication restrictions – and we started to see
alternatives emerge.  Many of us have observed Skype over the years
emerge as a means to communicate via video, audio or just a few lines of
text – it has become the espresso machine in the break room that
everyone chipped in for after the coffee cart raised its prices and cut
back operating hours.  It spurs conversations, connects people
informally, but can also lead to the only solution for a critical
conversation when all other options are inconvenient.  Notable is that
both the espresso machine and Skype-style platforms support an element
of “peripheral awareness” (i.e. who is around? How available are they to
chat right now?), another measure of proximity in both the physical and
virtual&amp;nbsp;worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy&lt;/strong&gt;: Wait a second. I thought we were talking about &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt;
collaboration?  It was my first reaction too, but it occurred to me that
maybe that’s why it’s so often ignored.  This affordance actually refers
to the &lt;em&gt;availability&lt;/em&gt; of privacy.  A quiet corner to discuss a sensitive
matter with a colleague is sometimes just as important as the
availability of that colleague in the first place.  In the virtual as in
the physical world, a private corner must be reasonably accessible,
always available and be clear in its degree of privacy.  Giving users
the option to set their status as “Away” or “Invisible” is a useful
means of proving some privacy, as are simple but prominent icons which
appear when an online conversation is one-on-one (and not available to a
larger audience).  Being overheard by the wrong person in the workplace
could be a bad thing, whether in a virtual or physical&amp;nbsp;realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Permission&lt;/strong&gt;:  In my opinion, herein lies our biggest challenge.  The
stigma of a collaborative spaces has historically been one of reluctant
acceptance by the working ranks, and intense resistance by management
(“Why are our employees wasting time chatting at the copy machine when
they could be in their cubicles finishing their &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TPS&lt;/span&gt; reports?”).  In
recent years however, has it become a common practice for managers to
actively encourage the cross-pollination of ideas, and more organic
interaction in their organizations. &lt;em&gt;Permission&lt;/em&gt; from above is essential
in the acceptance of a new way of doing one’s job, but there can be no
fear of reprisal if it is to truly take hold.  But is this trend
tracking the same&amp;nbsp;virtually?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the copy machine has been a shining example of giving
permission to interact.  Say you and an old friend from a different
division are making copies.  You’re still waiting for your copies to
finish, so you see no harm in discussing whether or not Shea Weber is
the best defenseman in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NHL&lt;/span&gt;, which leads to a discussion about what
else costs \$7.5 million, which leads to a new idea to save money at the
agency.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;, it’s a stretch, but you get the idea.  I’d say that’s a
successful interaction, whether or not the money-saving idea holds
water.  And it all started from the fact that two people in completely
different areas felt that they had permission to talk about what was on
their minds, regardless of&amp;nbsp;subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trend to granting permission to interact and collaborate in virtual
settings has been much slower to emerge.  In the virtual world there
seems to be another layer of resistance.  Not only is there discomfort
with the interaction itself, but the medium in which the interaction
takes place is also foreign – especially to those observing this
interaction from the physical&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe this at a meeting when attendees use a “backchannel”.  One
person speaking at a time, plus teleconferencing woes (lack of visual
cues, VoIP/cell phone delay) equate to a lot of people who might have an
opinion and not be able to voice it.  Online chat forums provide a venue
for those opinions without interrupting the speakers in the physical
world.  They provide on-demand “copier chatter” and expand it to anyone
in the organization.  On the other hand, laptops can distract, typing on
a Blackberry can convey disrespect, so taking advantage of these
features while in a meeting takes skill (in listening while typing) and
tact (in noticing if permission is granted).  What strikes me is this:
the very technologies which encourage a new way to interact virtually,
have physical qualities that limit our permission to use&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Affording permission to collaborate in new ways may be the most
challenging of the three elements to achieve, but it is also the one
that we as leaders have the most control over.  We lead by example,
influence corporate policies, and establish workplace norms.  It means
putting on everyone’s hats: seeing how each of the roles in the
workforce may benefit from virtual interaction, and allowing them to try
it out.  Establishing that it’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt; to experiment will allow the privacy
and proximity issues to emerge – and it will let the community itself
work those issues out.  I mean, isn’t that how it works when we all get
together in&amp;nbsp;person?&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>8 Keys to Creating and Building Lasting Enterprises</title><link href="/8-keys-to-creating-and-building-lasting-enterprises" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-08-04T13:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2011-08-04:8-keys-to-creating-and-building-lasting-enterprises</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an article I originally published on 09/03/2010, but the advice
is still very timely today so I updated and reposted here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the great things about new digital platforms like open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
that they allow us to easily connect, share, discover and expand our
experiences.  This includes sharing with each other those experiences
that inspire us and impact the way we see the world.  I thought I’d
share a talk I heard while attending the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MBA&lt;/span&gt; program at the &lt;a href="http://www.utexas.edu/"&gt;University
of Texas&lt;/a&gt; by entrepreneur, Gary Hoover.  Hoover created
&lt;a href="http://www.hoovers.com/"&gt;Hoovers.com&lt;/a&gt;, the world’s largest Internet-based provider of
information about enterprises and is also well know for essentially
creating the big box bookstore we know today.  His pioneering venture,
Bookstop, was eventually sold to Barnes &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; Noble and became a cornerstone
for their industry-dominating superstore chain. Hoover is the
“&lt;em&gt;Entrepreneur-in-Residence&lt;/em&gt;” at McCombs Business School and spends much
of his time today sharing his experience about creating and building
lasting enterprises and inspiring students to do the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoover speaks regularly and always includes a list of 8 key ideas on how
to create successful enterprises - a list that he has refined throughout
his career. He’s shared this list over 700 times on every continent but
Antarctica.  This list is also the topic of a book he wrote in 2001,
called “&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hoovers-Vision-Original-Thinking-Business/dp/1587990598"&gt;Hoover’s Vision: Original Thinking for Business Success.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;”
The rest of this post includes the detailed list (as posted on &lt;a href="http://hooversworld.com/archives/2923"&gt;Hoover’s
personal website&lt;/a&gt;) and a link to his webinar and the slides.  My hope
in sharing this with you today is to spread these great ideas further,
challenge us all to think differently, and inspire us to continue to do
things that amplify our impact and&amp;nbsp;reach.&lt;/p&gt;

Building Lasting&amp;nbsp;Enterprises&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Curiosity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;
— nothing is ever discovered by looking in the same place as everyone
else, or looking in the same way as everyone else.  All discovery starts
with exploration. Ask a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;lot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt; of
questions. Go beyond the first “why.” Study the mundane, the
“everyday.” Travel, observe, talk to people. Read, go to concerts, try
new things. Look at other industries. The answers are rarely where you
expect to find them. Opportunities are&amp;nbsp;everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;History&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt; —
you can’t know where you are going if you don’t know where you are
coming from.  Watching key long-term trends is a critical part of
successful leadership.  What are some of the trends to watch today? What
large demographic shifts are at work? What can be learned from the
leaders of the past, including those in your own industry and&amp;nbsp;company?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Geography&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;
— we all come from somewhere, we all grew up somewhere.  In a shrinking
world, it is more important than ever to understand people and
places. Do you know the population of your metropolitan area? Do you
know the growth rates of your county and surrounding counties? Do you
know what is going on in countries around the world, which places are
rising and falling and why? What are people leaving some places and
moving to&amp;nbsp;others?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;(I believe the above three mindsets are
the keys to dreaming up innovative new ideas that relate to the real
needs of real people.  Once you have a mission in mind, the points below
kick into&amp;nbsp;gear.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Clarity of Vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt; — can any third-grader understand your vision?
 Or are you trapped in double-speak and buzzwords, an alphabet soup of
acronyms, and&amp;nbsp;jargon?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Consistency of Vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt; — do you stick to what you are good at and what
you believe in, through thick and thin? Do you have a
consistent&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;purpose&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;6.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Service&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt; —
the only valid reason for the existence of an enterprise is to deliver
products and services to people, to somehow make the world a better
place. The minute you think that power resides in the boardroom or in
Washington, or that your company can be made great through making good
deals or acquisitions, rather than through focusing on the customers,
you are most likely at the beginning of the end. Serving others well
must be the top priority – your other stakeholders including suppliers,
community, investors, and employees will then have something to&amp;nbsp;share.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Unique Vision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt; — do you sound and look like all your
competitors or do you stand out, following a unique path that is true to
your enterprise and your soul? Differentiation is the&amp;nbsp;key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt;8.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #993300;"&gt;Passion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300;"&gt; —
if you aren’t doing something you love, you will never be the best at&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAC&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Advisory Council (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAC&lt;/span&gt;) provides the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Administrator with
counsel and advice on programs and issues of importance to the Agency.
The Council consists of nine committees, Aeronautics, Audit, Finance and
Analysis, Commercial Space, Education and Public Outreach, Exploration,
Information Technology Infrastructure, Science, Space Operations, and
Technology and Innovation. Each committee conducts sessions throughout
the year in an effort to gain a broad understanding of current &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
issues and future mission implementation plans. The committees then
bring their proposed observations, findings, and recommendations to the
full Council for deliberation and final decision on whether to send
forward to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;Administrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Council deliberates on topics raised by each committee in public
sessions and presents any observations, findings, and recommendations to
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Administrator on a quarterly&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;

for the open government community to share success stories and projects
they are working on.  The content on this site is written by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
employees and contractors.  We are excited to highlight the ways that
transparency, participation, and collaboration are being embraced by
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; policy, technology, and culture – and the amazing future that
becomes possible because of that&amp;nbsp;commitment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about the Open Government&amp;nbsp;Plan!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;) released its
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html"&gt;Open Government Plan&lt;/a&gt; on April 7th, 2010.  In December 2009, the
White House issued the Open Government Directive calling on Executive
Branch agencies to become more open and accountable. The Directive is
centered on the principles of transparency, collaboration, and
participation.  For more than 50 years, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has developed and nurtured
a rich culture of openness, fostering collaboration among scientists and
sharing the excitement surrounding scientific discoveries, aeronautics,
and space with the public at large.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is striving to incorporate
open government into every facet of its mission, from developing an open
source software cloud computing platform to creating new incentivized
challenges for talented and interested members of the public, following
the five &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government&amp;nbsp;principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government plan continues to create a new level of
openness and accountability in our policies, technology, and culture. As
the plan evolves over time &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will continue to see success in these
areas and work to replicate it throughout the Agency.  Over the past
year, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Government Plan was highly rated by the Administration
and the watchdog group, &lt;em&gt;openthegovernment.org.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was also among a
few agencies recognized with two &amp;#8220;Leading Practices&amp;#8221; Awards from the
White House, for achievement above and beyond the requirements of the
Open Government Directive in the categories of “Participation and
Collaboration” and “Flagship Initiatives.”  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is proud of our
achievements and looks forward to continuing to establish a solid
foundation for institutional change based on the five &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open
Government&amp;nbsp;principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external&amp;nbsp;stakeholders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable citizen participation in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; collaboration and&amp;nbsp;innovation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage partnerships and create economic&amp;nbsp;opportunity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutionalize Open Government philosophies and practices at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give me an example of OpenGov at work at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s commitment to Open Government is in the area of
scientific and technical information. In accordance with the &lt;em&gt;National
Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958’s&lt;/em&gt; commitment to “&lt;em&gt;provide for the
widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information
concerning its activities and the results thereof&lt;/em&gt;,” the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Technical
Reports Server provides the public access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s current and
historical technical literature and engineering results. Over 500,000
aerospace-related citations, over 200,000 full-text online documents,
and over 500,000 images and videos, all created or funded by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, are
publicly available. A common portal enables search and retrieval through
three primary multimedia collections that span &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s history. An
upgraded public interface was rolled out this year, which includes
algorithmic search assistance, search refinement and concept clouds,
opening up amazing artifacts of space history and enabling true
knowledge&amp;nbsp;discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Working Outside the Box at Johnson Space Center [A Cross-Post from ASK the Academy]</title><link href="/working-outside-the-box-at-johnson-space-center-a-cross-post-from-ask-magazine" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-28T23:45:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Chris Gerty</name></author><id>tag:,2011-07-28:working-outside-the-box-at-johnson-space-center-a-cross-post-from-ask-magazine</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recently, some talented folks from Valador co-located with the Open
Government Team in Houston for a co-working week.  In only a few days,
we accomplished a lot: discussed the future of our space agency, infused
different lines of thinking into a variety of projects we were
individually assigned, screened content for the upcoming &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsummit/index.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt;
Summit&lt;/a&gt; and collaborated on one project of international scale - all
while still attending those (mostly virtual) mandatory meetings we all
have every week.  One of the talents who joined us that week was &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nasa_appel"&gt;Haley
Stephenson of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;APPEL&lt;/span&gt; Ask the Academy team&lt;/a&gt;, who used the
opportunity to focus on the collaborative space that we met in, and
reflect on how it affects our work.  Below is &lt;strong&gt;her&lt;/strong&gt; work, available

&lt;p&gt;What impact does a room really have on your&amp;nbsp;work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_4336&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignright&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;300&amp;#8221;
caption=&amp;#8221;The sp.ace in Building 29 at Johnson Space
Center&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="Whiteboard tables and chairs in front of a wall-mounted
TV." src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/571670main_4-5_working_outside_box_jsc_1_full-300x224.jpg" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask someone where to find “the sp.ace” at Johnson Space Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;) and
they might look at you as though you’ve queried the location of Platform
9 ¾ or a wardrobe leading to Narnia. Between Buildings 34 and 585 at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;
sits Building 29. It once housed the Apollo astronaut centrifuge, and
later the Weightless Environment Training Facility (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;WETF&lt;/span&gt;)—a precursor to
the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory—which trained astronauts for Hubble
repair missions. Today Building 29 supports another mission:&amp;nbsp;collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside one of the high bays overlooking the former home of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WETF&lt;/span&gt; is a
work area available to everyone at the center. The decor is simple and
functional: whiteboard tables, colorful rolling chairs, mobile desks and
whiteboard walls. Have an idea? Write it on the table or a wall. Share
it on a screen. Need a bit of privacy? Go to the neighboring room (“the
fishbowl”) and work&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open, light, and flat, the sp.ace is an environment where people and
ideas can connect, collide, and coalesce. It is a place where the
traditional workforce meets the increasingly transient one. As project
teams become more geographically dispersed and the demand for
cross-disciplinary innovation continues to grow, some organizations are
creating work environments that foster disruptive ideas and unexpected&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000"&gt;Beyond Cubism&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Collaborative spaces are not new. Early coffeehouses from the 1600’s
were hotbeds of social interaction and collaboration. Walk into any
on-campus college café and you’ll see writing on the walls and hear
lively conversation. While the fundamentals of human collaboration have
not changed since the Enlightenment, the amount of information and
knowledge available through technological advances has. The challenge
facing organizations is to standardize the technology used to
collaborate and connect, not the location of the&amp;nbsp;worker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until the mid-1960s, typical office spaces consisted of open areas lined
with orderly rows of desks. Paperwork was filed in cabinets or neatly
piled in stacks on desktops. As the amount of information passing
through organizations increased, something had to&amp;nbsp;give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1968, Robert Propst invented the cubicle, which drastically altered
the office work environment. While the original intention of the cubicle
was to liberate workers from piles of paperwork and give them the
opportunity to spread out, visualize information differently, and
establish a sense of identity at the office, Propst’s invention took
another path. Now a symbol of compartmentalization, the workplace is
undergoing a shift away from &amp;#8220;cube farms&amp;#8221; toward more collaborative
working&amp;nbsp;spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_4340&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignleft&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;300&amp;#8221;

Johnson Space Center.&amp;#8221;][![Three collaborators using an overhead monitor

&lt;p&gt;Organizations like SpaceX have open, flat work environments designed to
reflect their flat organizational structure. Fuji Xerox has rooms in
Europe and Japan that are designed to elicit certain types of thinking –
a sort of “cognitive ergonomics,” a term used by researchers at large
office furniture companies like Steelcase and Herman Miller. Companies
from Google to Capital One have made open, transparent, collaborative
work spaces available to their&amp;nbsp;employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work real estate is at a premium. Projects are increasingly interagency
and international. Employees don’t always utilize an office—they’re
getting the job done elsewhere. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;, for example, has done away with
office space for tens of thousands of its employees. Practices such as
“hotelling,” where employees are given unassigned spaces in a work
environment, are being used to meet the needs of nomadic workers. This
way of working is making its way to&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2010, President Obama signed the Telework Enhancement Act
“to improve teleworking in executive agencies by developing a telework
program that allows employees to telework at least 20 percent of the
hours worked in every two administrative work weeks, and for other
purposes.” This June, executive agencies passed the first milestone of
informing employees who meet the teleworking criteria that they are
eligible for a new way to work. The next steps include acquiring
technologies to allow for incorporation of telework into agency
operations and policies in order to decrease real-estate costs.
Collaborative workspaces allow organizations to optimize the use of
their work real estate, and workspace is no longer defined by one
function or set of walls. It becomes adaptable, flexible; anything the
organization wants it or needs it to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #800000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sp.ace, the Sandbox, and Fab
Labs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is accustomed to collaboration on many levels. Collaborative
spaces exist at Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
connected by hyperwalls—large multi-screen displays—to collaborate on
projects such as high-resolution image analysis from Mars. The pixel
resolution allows for scientists separated by nearly 400 miles to
collaborate and plan out a rover’s path. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; sp.ace is a modest
beginning to something that hopes to grow. It&amp;#8217;s a place for people to
congregate and spur imagination, creativity, and curiosity. But it’s
only a&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_4341&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignright&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;300&amp;#8221;
caption=&amp;#8221;The &amp;#8220;Sandbox&amp;#8221; at Johnson Space Center&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="A warehouse with

&lt;p&gt;Plans for another collaborative working space at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; are afoot. The
“Sandbox” will draw on the global success of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; Fabrication
Laboratories (“Fab Labs”) which started gaining recognition in 2002. Fab
Labs were founded on the premise of giving people tools to create things
rather than consume them. The Sandbox, used to be warehouse that held
old boxes of this and that and then acquired a variety of electronics,
welding, and machining equipment in addition to an open meeting area. It
is the hardware/prototyping equivalent of the sp.ace in Building 29 and
will be virtually connected to other collaborative working spaces. As
this new space evolves, a sort of collaborative space “cookbook” with
information about standardizing connections (e.g., &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HDMI&lt;/span&gt; inputs),
bandwidth requirements, audio and video connections and positioning, and
power needs (e.g., easily accessible power strips) will be made
available for others to create other collaborative spaces capable of
connecting with established&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the creation of collaborative spaces at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; is continuing to
evolve, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; “sp.ace” has already had success with a designated
coworking week. Anyone from flight controllers, to administrative
assistants, to project teams utilized the space to meet their needs or
simply check it out. Throughout the week, as new faces trickled in and
familiar ones returned for another visit, it was apparent that an
entirely different wave of information and knowledge sharing driven by
increased technological capability is upon us. Traditional offices
aren’t supporting workforces like they have in the past, and
organizations are starting to&amp;nbsp;adapt.&lt;/p&gt;

Born out of an effort by &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/skytland/" title="Nick Skytland"&gt;Nick Skytland&lt;/a&gt; over five years ago, we first
began drafting some ideas on how the site will look, feel, and function
last fall. The preliminary designs we created were the designs we were
working with until roughly 48 hours ago (less than two days before the
launch of the site). For the most part, the site was very “traditional
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;” - starscape background, bold red and blue colors scheme, and a ton
of functionality that wasn’t really necessary but that we thought would
be nice to have. While sitting at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23oscon"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSCON&lt;/span&gt; 201&lt;/a&gt;1, however, we realized
something. If we really, really wanted open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to be a new, fresh look
on what’s happening at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we needed to so something bold. So, we
deleted all of our work and started from scratch. That’s right - this
entire site was created in just a few (crazy, late-night) hours. Doing
all this work in such a short time span, however, wouldn’t have been
possible without a little bit of help. I’m talking, of course, about
open&amp;nbsp;source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Source is big at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. It’s one of the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/open-source-development.html"&gt;flagship initiatives&lt;/a&gt; in
our &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open"&gt;Open Government plan&lt;/a&gt;. Last spring, we hosted our first ever
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/open-source-development.html"&gt;Open Source Summit&lt;/a&gt;. It drew 700+ attendees to
discuss the issues and solutions about developing open source
applications at the agency. Our most popular open source application,
&lt;a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov"&gt;World Wind&lt;/a&gt;, has had millions of downloads. open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is no exception
- it’s built entirely on open source and Software as a Service
technologies, meaning you can take everything you see here today and do
it on your own. Here’s&amp;nbsp;how:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Server Platform&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is hosted on a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt; stack&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://httpd.apache.org/"&gt;Apache&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.mysql.com/"&gt;MySQL&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.php.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PHP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). All of these are open source applications that are
near-universal. If you’ve built a website before, it’s most likely been
on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LAMP&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wordpress&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The core of open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is &lt;a href="http://www.wordpress.org"&gt;Wordpress 3.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, an open source content
management system approved for use by both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.apps.gov"&gt;General
Services Administration&lt;/a&gt;. We made no tweaks to the Wordpress core for
the site - it grabbed from the &lt;a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SVN&lt;/span&gt; repository&lt;/a&gt; and set up out of the&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The site is running a modified version of &lt;a href="http://www.landaureece.com/"&gt;Landau Reece’&lt;/a&gt;s free
&lt;a href="https://github.com/landaureece/Protean/blame/master/archive.php"&gt;Protean theme&lt;/a&gt; for Wordpress. We made a few changes to the theme to
create a unique look and feel to the site. We really like the design due
to how clean and simple it presents the content. Plus, each post allows
for customization by the author to give everyone a bit of&amp;nbsp;personality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disqus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our comments are driven by &lt;a href="http://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GSA&lt;/span&gt; approved commenting system
that connects conversations happening across the&amp;nbsp;web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UserVoice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want to hear from you! We’ve opened a &lt;a href="http://nasa.uservoice.com"&gt;UserVoice account&lt;/a&gt; to get
your feedback on our site, our projects, and hear your ideas for new
ways &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; can be more participatory, collaborative, and transparent with
the public. Be sure to also let us know via UserVoice if you see any
errors or bugs on the site. None of us are web developers by day, and we
definitely want to know if there’s something that need to be&amp;nbsp;fixed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sincerely hope you enjoy open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Feel free to use anything you see
on this site - we want you to benefit from the wonders of open source,
too! open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is a constantly evolving platform. Our goal is to make
this site a way for you to learn how we’re working every day to make
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; more accessible to the world. Your feedback and ideas are critical
in helping us do our jobs better. This is your space agency, and we hope
you are as excited as we are for the future. Let’s do great things&amp;nbsp;together.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Open Source"></category><category term="open.NASA"></category><category term="web development"></category></entry><entry><title>10 Reasons Why Government Should Embrace Hackathons</title><link href="/10-reasons-why-government-should-embrace-hackathons" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-28T18:20:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2011-07-28:10-reasons-why-government-should-embrace-hackathons</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rachelsterne"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;’s Chief Digital Officer Rachel Sterne&lt;/a&gt; wrote an article
about why cities (but really any level of government) should embrace the
code-a-thon. We couldn’t agree more, so we wanted to post her list
(slightly modified to include all government, not just &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;) on open.&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
and take this opportunity to encourage you to let you know about two
upcoming &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; sponsored / supported code-a-thon&amp;nbsp;events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waterhackathon, Fall 2011, &lt;a href="http://www.waterhackathon.org/"&gt;http://www.waterhackathon.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Random Hacks of Kindness, December 3-4, 2011,&lt;a href="%20http://www.rhok.org"&gt;http://www.rhok.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we hear that another &lt;a href="http://sciencehackday.com/"&gt;Science Hack Day is currently being
planned for November 12-13th&lt;/a&gt; in San&amp;nbsp;Francisco!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Original article: &lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2011/07/22/nyc-hackathon/"&gt;http://mashable.com/2011/07/22/nyc-hackathon/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rachel Sterne is Chief Digital Officer for the&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nyc.gov/portal/site/nycgov/?front_door=true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;City of New
York&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, where she focuses on the City’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/mome/nycodc/home.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;digital media
strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. You can follow her on Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rachelsterne"&gt;&lt;em&gt;@RachelSterne&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;or follow the

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will bridge sectors and connect the government and technology
    communities around a shared&amp;nbsp;challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will encourage collaborative problem-solving and a more open&amp;nbsp;government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will create a mechanism for the public to share feedback and&amp;nbsp;ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It can serve as a model for other governments, helping to affect
    national and international&amp;nbsp;change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will introduce creative and innovative concepts that could help
    to evolve government to be more efficient and effective in serving
    and empowering&amp;nbsp;citizens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will provide both individuals and teams with face-to-face
    access to governments decision&amp;nbsp;makers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It creates a precedent and platform for evolving government
    through open innovation and&amp;nbsp;participation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will serve as the first step in a transparent design&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps remove subjectivity from the design process by clearly
    showing what the public wants and&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It equips developers with the internal data they need to make user
    experience&amp;nbsp;decisions.&lt;/li&gt;

exploration mission.  You may have heard about some successful &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; open
source project before, like &lt;a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; WorldWind&lt;/a&gt; which has over 20 million
downloads since 2005.  One of the exciting projects currently being
undertaken at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is an open source space mission design and analysis
tool called &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; - The General Mission Analysis Tool.  &lt;a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jjkparker"&gt;Joel Parker&lt;/a&gt;
from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Goddard Space Flight Center presented on the latest
developments of the project today at the &lt;a href="http://www.oscon.com/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSCON&lt;/span&gt; conference in Portland,
Oregon&lt;/a&gt;.  In case you missed it, we summarized his presentation and
all the exciting developments for you&amp;nbsp;here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; software has been a collaborative development since 2005. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,
other space agencies, academia, private industry, Thinking Systems Inc,
Air Force Research Lab and others actively contribute to its
development. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; is released under the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Source Agreement
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOSA&lt;/span&gt;) and hosted on sourceforge meaning you can download it today and
start designing your own space missions!  The team actually ships the
software with 40 example mission scripts including geostationary,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCROSS&lt;/span&gt;, Mars transfer, Lunar transfer, Libration points.  You can find
even more on their project wiki &lt;span
style="color: #000000;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://gmat.ed-pages.com/wiki"&gt;http://gmat.ed-pages.com/wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

I provided some more detailed information below as well as the
presentation from Joel’s talk today, if you are interested.  What is
most exciting to me is that the product has the potential to
fundamentaly shift the business model behind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mission planning.
 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; currently spends a lot of funding on proprietary closed mission
trajectory planning software.  Last year the Navigation and Mission
Design Branch spent \$800k on software licenses alone!  This is software
that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; can&amp;#8217;t examine, modify, or learn from.  Therefore, this
development of an Open Source solution is a very valuable initiative and
serves as a great example of the value of Open Government at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;!

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; missions has the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; software supported?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The system has been used in support of the &lt;a href="http://lcross.arc.nasa.gov/"&gt;Lunar Crater Observation
and Sensing Satellite (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCROSS&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;, [&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ARTEMIS&lt;/span&gt; (Acceleration, Reconnection,
Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the
Sun)][], &lt;a href="http://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LRO&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://mms.gsfc.nasa.gov/"&gt;Magnetospheric
Multiscale (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MMS&lt;/span&gt;) Mission&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often does the team release a new version of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On average, the team is releasing a new version of the software every
six months. The development team does internal builds and testing&amp;nbsp;nightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the features of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;’s state of the art features include high fidelity orbit
propagation, impulsive and finite maneuver models,  parameter
optimization solvers, boundary solvers, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt; integration,  command
line and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; interfaces, 2-D and 3D graphics, custom scripting and
plug-ins, among many others and it provides these features in a
transparent and verifiable way through release of source&amp;nbsp;code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Major features&amp;nbsp;include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cross-platform desktop application (Windows, Mac,&amp;nbsp;Linux)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensive force models, differential corrector,&amp;nbsp;optimizer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics: 3D OpenGL, 2D plotting, 2D&amp;nbsp;mapping&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Custom mission scripting&amp;nbsp;language&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extensible via plugins, native functions, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation via C, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TCP&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Written in C++ with&amp;nbsp;wxWidgets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m interested in contributing to the project, how can you help?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; team is developing this tool to be used for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission and
is looking for help on developing the&amp;nbsp;software:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For&amp;nbsp;experts&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can I download this software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; is offered free of charge to use, modify, and share as described
under the terms of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Source Agreement v1.3.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; runs on
Windows, Mac, and Linux.  While &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; has undergone extensive testing and
is mature software, the team considers the software to be in Beta form
(alpha on Mac and Linux). &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; is part of an open source ecosystem at
Goddard Space Flight Center that includes both research-level and
operational-level&amp;nbsp;software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the plans for future development of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GMAT&lt;/span&gt; is collaboratively developed and is in constant
development to enable the planning of new mission concepts, there are a
number of new and exciting capabilities being planned.   Ongoing
development&amp;nbsp;includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Event&amp;nbsp;detection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ground track&amp;nbsp;plot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orbit&amp;nbsp;Wizard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Force models (Mars atmosphere, general relativity, Earth&amp;nbsp;tides)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User experience: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; improvements, interface&amp;nbsp;options&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the other trajectory planning tools that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; uses?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; uses a suite of tools for trajectory planning&amp;nbsp;including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FreeFlyer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copernicus, Pyxis, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MALTO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SPICE&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHEBYTOP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VARITOP&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OTIS&lt;/span&gt;, Mystic,
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SBC&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LTOC&lt;/span&gt;, MAnE,&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/li&gt;

non-technical everyday public. ISSLive! provides a website that
seamlessly integrates &lt;strong&gt;planning and telemetry data, video feeds, 3D
models, and iOS and android applications&lt;/strong&gt;. Through the site, users are
able to view astronauts’ daily schedules, in plain English alongside the
original data. As an example, when an astronaut is working with a
science experiment, a user will be able to &lt;strong&gt;read about the activity and
for more detailed activities follow provided links to view more
information&lt;/strong&gt; – all integrated into the same site. &lt;strong&gt;Live telemetry data
from a predefined set can also be provided&lt;/strong&gt; alongside the activities.
For users to learn more, 3D models of the external and internal parts of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; are available, allowing users to explore the station and even
&lt;strong&gt;select sensors, such as temperature, and view a real-time chart of the
data&lt;/strong&gt;. Even ground operations are modeled with a 3D mission control
center, providing users information on the various flight control
disciplines and &lt;strong&gt;showing live data that they would be monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; -
update from ISSLive!&amp;nbsp;team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project exemplifies &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s commitment to the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html"&gt;core values of Open
Government&lt;/a&gt;, the future of &lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/home/index.html"&gt;human spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;, and keeping the
public involved and connected to &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;space&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300"&gt;Transparency:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Thousands of data
points are downloaded every minute from the Station, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Live! makes
a broad set of that data open and accessible. Furthermore,  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Live!
will make an application programming interface (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;) available as a web
service for external developers to take &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; data and put it into their
own websites and mobile&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prime challenge for this project has been the translation of the
short, highly abbreviated, activity names, flowcharts, and formats used
in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; operations environment, known as operations nomenclature (or
“&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;-ese”), to something more public friendly that does not require
unique knowledge. The translator also functions to protect confidential,
private, or sensitive&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300"&gt;Collaboration:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This
collaborative effort between the Mission Operations Directorate, the
Office of Education, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; Program, and others around &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; truly
demonstrate the best in working together for public engagement.
Externally, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live!&lt;/em&gt; developers are partnering with Human Computer
Interface Design Students at top-ranked Carnegie Mellon University to
create application prototypes and interfaces to display &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live!&lt;/em&gt; data
for the&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project content will additionally serve as the basis for development
of interactive lessons in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;) fields, inspiring the next generation of explorers.  The
questions &amp;#8216;how does the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; work&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;what does the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt; do&amp;#8217; are
currently not answered well in a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; context - but ISSLive! is
committed to doing exactly that, with real models and real data in a
rich multimedia&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="color: #993300"&gt;Participation:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; You aren&amp;#8217;t just
watching the Mission Control team look at their screens - you will see
some of what they see. (I wish they had this when I was doing high
school science projects!) Vitally aware of the power of social media,
ISSLive! will incorporate the latest social media feeds relevant to the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;, including astronaut twitter feeds, image of the day and real-time
mission video, giving space enthusiasts and life-long learners another
route of participation in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anticipated release date for ISSLive! (via the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; portal and
iTunes) is &lt;strong&gt;October 1&lt;/strong&gt;. My iPad can&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;wait!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is expanding transparency, participation, and collaboration and
creating a new level of openness and accountability. We are focusing on
embedding open government into three integrated aspects of our
operations—policy, technology, and culture. Whether &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is using social
networks to allow students to interact directly with astronauts, or
creating a Cloud Computing Platform to give unprecedented access to
scientific data, we have embraced the Open Government Directive.
Highlights of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Government Activities &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s founding
legislation in 1958 instructed &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to “…provide for the widest
practicable and appropriate dissemination of information…” The
principles of open government have been embedded in our operations for
50+ years. We recognize that open government is a process rather than a
product, and have taken a continuous-learning approach. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open
Government activities span 22 identified Agency projects across the
centers, and 3 flagship initiatives will take the Initiative to a new
level: Policy: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is working to make open source software development
more collaborative at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to benefit both the Agency and the public.

(&lt;em&gt;Stop
laughing&lt;/em&gt;.) I watched it for the first time on vacation in Florida when
I was 10, and it immediately captured my imagination. Kids having fun
learning about space and finding themselves launched to orbit, because a
robot believed in a boy&amp;#8230;. and along the way discovering what was in
them and accomplishing a mission no one believed&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It really is what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is about. Not the
accidentally-launching-kids-into-orbit part, but the “okay,
we-can-do-this” part. The focus that says it might not have gone like we
had expected, but we’ll find another way. The confidence that you might
be a Space Camper &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;, but if you study and work hard and stick with
your team, you might be landing Atlantis &lt;em&gt;tomorrow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s sadly easy to become uninspired, though - to allow the paperwork
and the deadlines and the meetings to pile up and deflate your passion,
to make you forget why you are here. So here are 7 things to remind you
about why we explore and why it matters, to help you think differently
about today so that our tomorrow will be different when we get&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#1: Fragile Oasis (fragileoasis.org) asks us “what kind of world do
you&amp;nbsp;want?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYh6BD6-Hc8&amp;amp;feature=share"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYh6BD6-Hc8&amp;amp;feature=share&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vital question that changes everything. What kind of world do you
want? And what are &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; doing to shape it toward&amp;nbsp;that?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t asked yourself this question lately, you really&amp;nbsp;should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#2: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135 Flight Director Tony Ceccacci’s post-landing handover
speech to Mission&amp;nbsp;Control:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0jR8fqXdzg"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0jR8fqXdzg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought I would cry when Atlantis landed, but I did okay until Tony
gave this little talk to the team. It’s so easy to get complacent, to
think that your job doesn’t matter, or that it isn’t going anywhere.
Often it feels like the agency is caught in the middle, and we forget
that pride of doing something incredibly special that very few other
organizations have ever accomplished. He reminds them that they are the
ones who have sent the crew to space and brought them back safely, and
they are the best in the world at&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#3: The online petition to save the James Webb Space&amp;nbsp;Telescope:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/do-not-cancel-funding-for-the-james-webb-space-telescope"&gt;http://www.change.org/petitions/do-not-cancel-funding-for-the-james-webb-space-telescope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you’ve seen this, because I love it: people are engaging their
congressional leadership to try and save the next space telescope. There
are t-shirts and facebook groups and I even heard about attempts to
start a non-profit. I can’t help but believe that the amazing film
Hubble 3D helped with this, taught the public the incredible value of
this technology and what we can learn about ourselves from the universe
around us. This is the people&amp;#8217;s space agency, and they are making their
voice heard about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t signed this yet, go do it right&amp;nbsp;now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#4: Threadless creates a design challenge for the Final&amp;nbsp;Frontier:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://atrium.threadless.com/nasa/submissions/"&gt;http://atrium.threadless.com/nasa/submissions/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a fun one to throw in with the serious. Threadless is an amazing
example of crowdsourcing design out to the&amp;nbsp;public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonder what the public view of exploration is? Go check it out and vote
for your&amp;nbsp;favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#5: The plaque flown on Atlantis during &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commander Chris Ferguson concluded the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135 crew return ceremony with
the story of this little plaque that they left in the orbiter after the&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;This plaque flew on the final Space Shuttle Mission in July, 2011.
From the fortunate few who have served in space to the thousands who
make spaceflight a reality, thank you for keeping the dream alive. Your
passion for these amazing space ships will always stand as proof of what
this country can do when it dares to be&amp;nbsp;bold!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the charge right there from the commander of the final&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we dare to be bold? Are we going where the current takes us? or where
no other has gone&amp;nbsp;before?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;#6: Popular Science petitions Congress to keep human spaceflight&amp;nbsp;alive:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part is where author John Mahoney notes: &amp;#8220;But the reason an
estimated one million people packed up their cars and RVs to drive to
the Space Coast for a space shuttle launch is because it is put on by
the people. Everyone who made that launch possible&amp;#8212;in the truest
definition of a government employee, they&amp;#8217;re our representatives in this
incredible project. We don&amp;#8217;t just associate ourselves with them, we live
through them. That means something. They&amp;#8217;ve devoted their life to this
very civil, very scientific cause&amp;#8212;the exploration of outer&amp;nbsp;space.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REAL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PEOPLE&lt;/span&gt;. I was privileged to watch the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STS&lt;/span&gt;-135 launch with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VIP&lt;/span&gt;
guests of the &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/shuttle_station/index.html"&gt;Space Shuttle Program&lt;/a&gt;. I sat in a room with dozens of
people who had worked on Shuttle for 25-30 years. Managers, technicians,
engineers, administrators. Their names might never be known but they
make this possible. I work with some of these real people who are
keeping the dream alive. My team that does the hard work of changing
policy, technology, and culture so that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is ready to meet the future
challenges. My friend leaving &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; for grad school in space policy so
that she can help the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; of tomorrow be ready for the work it needs to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I had to save the best for&amp;nbsp;last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sawyer (@thenasaman) won’t let go of the dream, no matter what his
circumstances might tell him. He shows up. He asks questions about
&lt;a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/home/index.html"&gt;human spaceflight&lt;/a&gt;. He didn’t like how the media talked about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;?
He starts his own podcast and does something new. He supports &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in
the thick and the thin, the popular, well-known missions&amp;#8230; and the
not-so-popular. He doesn’t just think that space is cool - he believes
that the work &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; does might also one day enable him to walk&amp;nbsp;again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re my hero, Sawyer, and we’re in this thing together. If you aren’t
giving up, I’m not giving up&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I kind of want to see those footprints on the moon&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Why Now?</title><link href="/why-opengov-why-now" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-07-26T09:00:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2011-07-26:why-opengov-why-now</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is a new compact on the horizon: information produced by and on
behalf of citizens is the lifeblood of the economy and the nation;
government has a responsibility to treat that information as a national
asset. Citizens are connected like never before and have the skill sets
and passion to solve problems affecting them locally as well as
nationally. Government information and services can be provided to
citizens where and when they need them. Citizens are empowered to spark
the innovation that will result in an improved approach to governance.
In this model, government is a convener and an enabler rather than the
first mover of civic&amp;nbsp;action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim O’Reilly in &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;Government as
a&amp;nbsp;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;OpenGov?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a new transplant into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Government Initiative, I’m often
asked why I joined the team and what exactly it is that we do. Once that
conversation starts, it usually evolves around to the state of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. My
well-meaning friends begin to wonder why we are investing in something
like Open Government when it might seem like we are divesting from
actual space exploration. The conversation generally goes one of two
ways – either the &lt;em&gt;Shouldn’t &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; be focused on other things right
now?&lt;/em&gt;route (the fallacy that choosing OpenGov means not choosing
exploration) or the &lt;em&gt;We can’t be transparent about what we do!&lt;/em&gt;route
(the misconception that OpenGov means limitless data and process&amp;nbsp;transparency.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I smile and reassure them that I’m not here to steal their data or
expose anything or give them extra work to do. I’m here to help them
find solutions that will allow government to work better in our current
technological, economic, and social&amp;nbsp;climate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You see, here’s the thing: the goal of OpenGov is not just data
transparency or technology use. “Open government is an innovative
strategy for changing how government works,” Beth Noveck, the original
director of the White House Open Government Initiative, explains. “By
using network technology to connect the public to government and to one
another informed by open data, an open government asks for help with
solving problems. The end result is more effective institutions and more
robust&amp;nbsp;democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning, democracy was supposed to be participatory. Thomas
Jefferson noted in a letter how he envisioned a government where “every
man…feels that he is a participator in the government of affairs, not
merely at an election one day in the year, but every&amp;nbsp;day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every day. Every mission. Every&amp;nbsp;American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&amp;nbsp;now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now is the vital time for us to expand the practice of open government
across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, because now is the vital time to change the way we&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; puts hundreds of new datasets online about climate, and then
creates tools to communicate and apply that data, it is collaborating
with the public to solve real-world problems together. (Check out some
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open data: &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/data.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/open/data.html&lt;/a&gt; and one way we
are putting that data to good use:
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/rhok_2010.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/open/rhok_2010.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; considers “open source first,” it can often save time and
money from reinventing the wheel, and helps insure the best, most
current, and most compatible software use. (Check out updates from our
recent Open Source Summit: &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/source/"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/open/source/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; continues to expand its practice of open innovation, it can
access the ideas of citizen scientists and inventors, sharing resources
and lessons learned for the good of the agency – and the country. (Check
out &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Innovation Pavilion:
&lt;a href="https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/NASA"&gt;https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; creates more coworking/collaboration spaces instead of
sustaining more unique infrastructure, we not only save money and share
resources but cross-pollinate, share ideas, and make space for new
partnerships. (Check out the sp.ace, one of just a few coworking spaces
across the agency: &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/space"&gt;http://open.nasa.gov/space&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; doesn’t just do education outreach but invites public
participation in the mission in concrete and meaningful ways, we create
a public who is personally invested in space exploration and is ready to
advocate for its value. At the same time, we increase the breadth and
depth of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; education vital for our country’s success. (Check out some
of the recent efforts in Participatory Exploration:
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/peo.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/peo.html&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core principle of OpenGov is &lt;strong&gt;collaboration informed by data&lt;/strong&gt;. We
are facing some pretty big questions as we move forward into the next
phase of space exploration. What is more innately “&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;” than putting
the best minds – wherever they are to be found – around the data to come
up with the best solution? OpenGov means that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; belongs to all of us
– and we acknowledge that mission success will take all of us.
Committing to the principles of OpenGov (transparency, participation,
and collaboration) will improve our performance, better inform our
decision-making, and encourage entrepreneurship in our&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have friends and colleagues doing incredible work developing next
generation space vehicles and system, sustaining the work on the
International Space Station, and doing life and earth science research
that advances technology almost daily. I know those who are ready to
write seriously inspired space policy, who are building bridges with
commercial crew and cargo companies, and who are training for
exploration that most of us can’t yet imagine. I believe that OpenGov is
going to give them the kind of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; where they can accomplish these
important&amp;nbsp;tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Inspiration"></category><category term="Opengov"></category><category term="Participation"></category></entry><entry><title>NASA Open Data Highlight: Voyager</title><link href="/nasa-open-data-highlight-voyager" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-06-15T18:46:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2011-06-15:nasa-open-data-highlight-voyager</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Even in hindsight, I would not change one whit of the Voyager

Mission Analysis&amp;nbsp;Engineer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the last 33 years, the twin Voyager spacecraft have been exploring
the edges of the solar system. Since 1998, it is the most distant
man-made object from earth, and continues to be one of the most prolific
sources of planetary data for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The mission continues to be a leader
in science and science data. Per the crafts’ approximate 2011 locations,
ground signals traveling at the speed of light take about 13 hours one
way to reach Voyager 2, and 16 hours one way to reach Voyager&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voyager’s final mission is to study the heliopause, the boundary at
which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium.
Scientists expect that Voyager 1 will cross the heliopause sometime
between 2012-2015, continuing to truly push the boundaries of the known&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some of Voyager’s key scientific efforts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imaging Science System: utilizes a two-camera system
    (narrow-angle/wide-angle) to provide imagery of Jupiter, Saturn and
    other&amp;nbsp;objects&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radio Science System: utilizes the telecommunications system of the
    Voyager spacecraft to determine the physical properties of planets
    and satellites and the amount and size distribution of material in
    Saturn&amp;#8217;s rings and the ring&amp;nbsp;dimensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer: investigates both global and
    local energy balance and atmospheric&amp;nbsp;composition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ultraviolet Spectrometer: designed to measure atmospheric properties
    and&amp;nbsp;radiation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer: designed to investigate the magnetic
    fields of Jupiter and Saturn, the solar-wind interaction with the
    magnetospheres of these planets, and the interplanetary magnetic
    field out to the solar wind boundary with the interstellar magnetic
    field and&amp;nbsp;beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plasma Spectrometer: investigates the macroscopic properties of the
    plasma ions and measures&amp;nbsp;electrons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Low Energy Charged Particle Instrument: measures the differential in
    energy fluxes and angular distributions of ions, electrons and the
    differential in energy ion&amp;nbsp;composition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cosmic Ray System: determines the origin and acceleration process,
    life history, and dynamic contribution of interstellar cosmic rays,
    the nucleosynthesis of elements in cosmic-ray sources, the behavior
    of cosmic rays in the interplanetary medium, and the trapped
    planetary energetic-particle&amp;nbsp;environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Planetary Radio Astronomy: utilizes a sweep-frequency radio receiver
    to study the radio-emission signals from Jupiter and&amp;nbsp;Saturn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photo Polarimeter: utilizes a telescope with a polarizer to gather
    information on surface texture and composition of Jupiter and Saturn
    and information on atmospheric scattering properties and density for
    both&amp;nbsp;planets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plasma Wave System: provides continuous, sheath-independent
    measurements of the electron-density profiles at Jupiter and Saturn
    as well as basic information on local wave-particle interaction,
    useful in studying the&amp;nbsp;magnetospheres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data: Where to find some of the data Voyager is sending back through
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JPL&lt;/span&gt;’s Deep Space&amp;nbsp;Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Golden Record: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; Open&amp;nbsp;Data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Voyager spacecraft carry recorded messages from Earth on golden
phonograph records – 12-inch, gold-plated copper disks. A committee
chaired by the late astronomer Carl Sagan selected the contents of the
records for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The records are cultural time capsules that the
Voyagers carry with them to other star systems. They contain images and
natural sounds, spoken greetings in 55 languages and musical selections
from different cultures and&amp;nbsp;eras.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education&amp;nbsp;Outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Voyager team has also been incredibly committed to doing student
outreach to celebrate “humanity’s furthest journey” and invite students
to connect with the team and the science behind the mission. Wonder what
kind of questions the students had about Voyager? Check out their

focused on developing practical open source solutions to disaster risk
management and climate change adaptation challenges. RHoK is a
collective initiative by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and the World
Bank, which brought together thousands of people June 4-5, 2011, from
over 18 locations around the globe to create open solutions to solve
some of humanity’s toughest&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; events took place in Hartford, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle and
Silicon Valley. International locations included Toronto, Canada,
Aarhus, Denmark, Basel, Switzerland, Berlin, Germany, Bangalore, India,
Buenos Aires, Argentina, Kampala, Uganda, Lusaka, Zambia, Melbourne,
Australia, Nairobi, Kenya, Trento, Italy, and Santiago,&amp;nbsp;Chile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications created in past RHoK events are already making an impact
across the globe. “I&amp;#8217;m &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OK&lt;/span&gt;”, an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; (Short Message Service) application
that lets people inform their families of their status during
emergenices, was actually used on the ground during the devastating
earthquakes in Haiti and Chile in 2010. The World Bank is piloting
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CHASM&lt;/span&gt;, software for visualizing landslide risk, in the Caribbean. Other
apps have received support and interest from governments,
non-governmental organizations (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NGO&lt;/span&gt;) and other international
organizations around the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHoK #3 was the most successful RHoK event yet and is a great example
of what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is doing to help accelerate innovation, collaboration and
development of open technologies.  To learn more about the vision and
some of the results of this worldwide effort, please continue&amp;nbsp;reading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also encourage you to check out the rest of our blog posts from the&amp;nbsp;event:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Random Hacks of&amp;nbsp;Kindness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHoK works by bringing experts in development and volunteers with a
broad set of skills in software development and design together to
create solutions to some of humanity’s toughest challenges. The events
draw the best and the brightest hackers from around the world to sprint
on developing technology solutions. It has been described as “a globally
coordinated competitive hacking event where anyone interested in
technology (software developers, independent hackers, students, etc.)
comes together with experts in disaster risk management (NGOs,
organizations within the U.N., individuals involved in relief and
development work) to create software-based solutions that address
problems causing human suffering.”&lt;br /&gt;
Random Hacks of Kindness was founded in 2009 in partnership
between&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/microsoft"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/yahoo"&gt;Yahoo!&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/nasa"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the&lt;a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/world-bank"&gt;World
Bank&lt;/a&gt;. Since then thousands of volunteers have worked on applications
that are already making an&amp;nbsp;impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe the “hackathon” as a&amp;nbsp;concept?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia has a great
definition:&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon&lt;/a&gt;.  They call it “an
event when programmers meet to do collaborative computer programming”
and give some great background on the&amp;nbsp;concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is “Open Government” and what does that have to do with&amp;nbsp;RHoK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Open Government Initiative is an innovative strategy for changing
how government works.   &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s founding legislation in 1958 instructed
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to &amp;#8220;…provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information” and embedded the principles of open
government into the agency from its founding. The Initiative, which we
are implementing under White House direction via the President’s Open
Government Directive, is our commitment to revisit these values as we
create a new level of openness and accountability in our policies,
technology, and overall&amp;nbsp;culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last April, we released &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Government Plan which sets up 150+
milestones for more than 22 key projects and 3 Flagship Initiatives.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Flagship Initiatives include open source software development,
the establishment of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Nebula cloud computing platform, and the
expansion of participatory exploration as a core engagement process
across the agency.  You can see the plan and track our progress
at:&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/open&lt;/a&gt;.  We just released a really great
infographic that talks about many of the Open Government related
projects we are working on at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, which you can view here:
&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/infographic.html"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/open/infographic.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The philosophies and practices of the Open Government Initiative reflect
the shifting global environment and the challenges that this poses to
government.  We have a mandate from our nation’s leadership to engage
the public in the core of our mission, giving us permission to do things
differently.  We see Open Government as a catalyst to improve the way we
communicate, the way we collaborate, and the way we do&amp;nbsp;business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHoK is a project of the Open Government Initiative within the Office of
the Chief Information Officer. The Open Government team is part of the
core strategy team for RHoK and attends some of the physical mainstage
RHoK events and also participates in the online RHoK community
year-round.  Our hope is that we will serve as another resource to share
information about what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has to offer for developers who are creating
practical open source, open technology&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the “Open Government Team”&amp;nbsp;do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “Open Government Team” is responsible for the implementation of the
Open Government Initiative at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.  We work every day to establish a
solid foundation for institutional change at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; based on five guidiing&amp;nbsp;principles:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external&amp;nbsp;stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable citizen participation in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;mission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improve internal &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; collaboration and&amp;nbsp;innovation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encourage partnerships capable of creating economic&amp;nbsp;opportunity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Institutionalize OpenGov philosophies and practices at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; participate in&amp;nbsp;RHoK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is one of the founding partners of RHoK, along with Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo! and the World Bank.  It’s a unique collaboration that
encourages developers and experts to use their skills to help change the
world.  &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; participates by encouraging the utilization of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; data –
specifically, the use of what we call “open data.” &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has immensely
valuable open databases, which can serve as the content to many
potential world-changing&amp;nbsp;apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; think RHoK a good resource for&amp;nbsp;innovation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A main focus of the Open Government Initiative is to offer citizens and
communities of innovators opportunities to participate in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s space
exploration mission and likewise, for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to work with citizens. RHoK
is extremely important for us because we strive to learn from the
know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of those outside government
institutions. We have a number of “innovation platforms” that we have
deployed to gives citizen explorers an opportunity to access our
scientific data and help solve our toughest challenges.  RHoK is one of
those many platforms for&amp;nbsp;innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Open Government is all about embracing the concept of “open
innovation” - the idea of bringing together thousands of software
developers from around the world to crowdsource some of humanities
toughest challenges is really appealing to us.  We value working in a
transparent, participatory, and collaborative fashion because it helps
us improve performance, inform decision-making, encourage
entrepreneurship, and solve problems more effectively.  Additionally,
working with Google, Microsoft, Yahoo. and the World Bank to host Random
Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a unique and valuable collaboration. We are
proud that it is dedicated to using technology to make the world a
better&amp;nbsp;place&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is “open data” and where can I find &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s open&amp;nbsp;data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we are constantly looking for new partnerships in order to
accomplish our mission to explore our universe and improve life on
Earth. Sharing our data is vital to this vision. Since &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s inception,
the agency has archived vast amounts of diverse data from many
exploration missions. Today, the digital landscape has changed, and the
amount of data produced has increased exponentially (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; now archives
over &lt;span class="caps"&gt;4TB&lt;/span&gt; of new Earth Science data each day), but the vision itself is
no different.  Sometimes this data is used to help understand our
origins in the universe.  Sometimes we end up with a more extensive view
of the Earth’s climate or learn how to operate aircraft more
effectively. Through collaborations like RHoK, we hope that some of our
data will be used to solve some of humanity’s toughest&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open data is the acknowledgement that the value of data can continue to
grow, even after its original primary application has been realized.
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; encourages RHoK developers to build on our open data in new ways to
create cutting edge applications for the benefit of society. By
participating in RHoK events, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; not only can share its invaluable
information with the RHoK community, but it can inspire the development
of new ideas and the creation of open technology that may can help serve
humanity and further the vision in unpredictable&amp;nbsp;ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can these rapid, focused hackathons serve as a model for new ways
to tackle issues that challenge the&amp;nbsp;agency?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; recognizes that innovation is always a numbers game; the more you
do it, the better your chances are of being successful.  No single
breakthrough, no matter how bold or well executed, will pay dividends
forever.  Because there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
people around the globe looking for opportunities to participate in
challenging and meaningful projects, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is intentional about
empowering citizens to become a source of critical skills and knowledge,
as well as sustainable competitive advantage.  What is most important
about RHoK is not the final product, but the process.  RHoK breaks down
barriers that prevent innovation and challenge the way business has
always been done by taking advantage of many of the possibilities
created by working in a networked digital&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a “successful” outcome from a weekend&amp;nbsp;hackathon?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful weekend for us is one in which hundreds, if not thousands,
of developers from around the world gather together to invent technology
that didn’t exist 24 hours ago!  It’s about having an idea and
implementing it.  It’s about celebrating the process of innovation that
has made America what it is today.  This is especially relevant in a
time of increased economic and budgetary&amp;nbsp;constraints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some examples of solutions developed at&amp;nbsp;RHoK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More then 18 RHoK events were held this past weekend.  The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; OpenGov
team participated in two mainstage locations – Seattle and Philadelphia
- and have summarized the problems and solutions below. The diversity of
these project areas are pleasantly surprising and a great example of the
type of work done at RHoK: climate change, food sources, government
transparency, web anonymity, non-profit visibility, and environmental
hazard awareness. It was exciting to see projects that scoured
everything from local Philadelphia zip codes to the huge amount of daily
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; climatological data, as well as low- (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; response) and high- (high
altitude balloons) tech&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six project areas emerged in RHoK&amp;nbsp;Philadelphia:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A platform to verify local ground weather data in Bolivia with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;

    and social media plugins to update Tor relay status
    &lt;a href=""&gt;(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/nort-tor-updater)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Splash: A site to match non-profit organizations to citizens looking
    to help or&amp;nbsp;donate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disaster Mapper: A search engine for data on local community hazards
    in Philadelphia
    &lt;a href=""&gt;(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/disaster-mapper)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven project areas emerged in RHoK&amp;nbsp;Seattle:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://saaraa.recoverywashington.org"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAARAA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Providing situational awareness and rapid damage
    assessments to first responders.
    &lt;a href=""&gt;(http://www.rhok.org/problems/saaraa-situational-awareness-and-rapid-assessment-application)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;eco-Tricorder: A means to take publicly available environmental data
    to the smartphone, and allow users to augment the satellite or other
    global data with local measurements.
    &lt;a href=""&gt;(http://www.rhok.org/problems/eco-tricorder)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tethered Towers: Using a tethered high-altitude balloon with
    sensors/wifi attached to it to provide situational awareness to
    ground teams in localized disaster areas.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the products developed make use of space technology directly
(data, imagery, satellite systems) or&amp;nbsp;indirectly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two examples of RHoK projects from this past weekend that incorporated
space data/technology into their&amp;nbsp;solutions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In RHoK Philadelphia, a team created a “Real Time Climate Data
    Comparison App” to verify local ground weather data in Bolivia with
    &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; satellite data.  The platform allows users to download
    satellite, combine weather data and have access to different input
    for their hydrological models.  The benefit of this platform allows
    local weather institutions in developing countries to make better
    decisions based on climate&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In RHoK Seattle, the project Eco-Tricorder
    (&lt;a href="http://vimeo.com/24861432"&gt;http://vimeo.com/24861432&lt;/a&gt;) maps environmental data from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EPA&lt;/span&gt;
    and/or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.  The app gives the option of augmenting that data with
    local citizen&amp;nbsp;scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; serve as a catalyst for these sort of events across the
Federal&amp;nbsp;government?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are living in an era of accelerated change that is quietly
threatening the effectiveness and existence of many organizations -
especially including government.  The world around us changing and no
industry is immune including healthcare, entertainment, energy, and
journalism as well as politics and aerospace.  With the new realities of
living in the information age, citizens are increasingly turning to the
Internet as a platform to engage with government, to find relevant and
accessible information and to uncover new opportunities to participate.
RHoK is a reflection of this shifting environment and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
participation in RHoK can serve as a catalyst for these sorts of events
across the federal government. RHoK is a key element in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
innovation strategy and events like it will help to reshape the future
of government in the information age. RHoK symbolizes what can happen
when thousands of people collaborate in an open, transparent and
participatory way to change the world in a positive&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m interested in participating or hosting a RHoK event!  Where can I
find out more&amp;nbsp;information?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

with a broad set of skills in software development and design. The goal
is to produce practical open source solutions to development&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface between domain experts and technical experts is the unique
realm of Random Hacks of Kindness – bringing both sides of the
conversation to the table. As RHoK has happened live around us, it has
been fascinating to see what these events have in common and what
uniquely characterized the local&amp;nbsp;challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six project areas emerged in RHoK Philadelphia this weekend:&lt;br /&gt;
1. A platform to verify local ground weather data in Bolivia with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
satellite data&lt;br /&gt;
2. A program to provide nearby sources of healthy food for low-income
citizens in Philadelphia via &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMS&lt;/span&gt; along with a ‘healthy living tip’
(PhillySNAP)&lt;br /&gt;
3. A usable, searchable interface to details of Philadelphia City
Council legislation&lt;br /&gt;
4. A response to the Tor relay challenge
(&lt;a href="http://www.eff.org/torchallenge"&gt;www.eff.org/torchallenge&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
5. A site to match non-profit organizations to citizens looking to help
or donate (Splash)&lt;br /&gt;
6. A search engine for data on local community hazards in&amp;nbsp;Philadelphia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diversity of these project topics was pleasantly surprising: climate
change, food sources, government transparency, web anonymity, non-profit
visibility, and environmental hazard awareness. It was also exciting to
see projects that scoured everything from local Philadelphia zip codes
to the huge amount of climatological data that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; archives on a daily&amp;nbsp;basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited to see this commitment to local relevance happening in
RHoK. The tech community here in Philadelphia is particularly
civic-minded, which lines up with RHoK’s mission to make a serious
social impact through&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I think it&amp;#8217;s interesting that it seems &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHOK&lt;/span&gt; Philly had a much more
local bent than most of the other locations. Philadelphia has this
really vibrant, growing civic-oriented technology community. We find
that the developers and designers who are here are here because they
want to be, so there&amp;#8217;s a great interest in making it a better place to
live. The Philly tech scene has a big focus on making Philly a better
place, but the inspiration, motivation and mission of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RHOK&lt;/span&gt; is still
there,&amp;#8221; noted Christopher Wink, co-founder of Technically Philly, a site
covering technology, startups, and venture capital in&amp;nbsp;Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partnership of Technically Philly (&lt;a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/"&gt;http://technicallyphilly.com/&lt;/a&gt;)
and Drexel University brought developers and subject matter experts
particularly aware of local needs and issues, as well as a number of
entrepreneurs and ”idea-types” - while RHoK partners &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and World Bank
brought global data and concerns. The projects were created at the
intersection of these values – and the tools developed should be
transferable far beyond&amp;nbsp;Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has also long been aware of this vital global-local connection.
Projects like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; @ Home and City track the effects of space
exploration into your daily life
(&lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasacity/index2.htm"&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasacity/index2.htm&lt;/a&gt;). Many of these
RHoK projects will start in daily life… and potentially could end up
connected to exploration, or poverty, or open government. These tools
reflect the shift in how we live, how our networked society works, and
how citizens can engage the world around them to make it&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Open Data"></category><category term="RHoK"></category></entry><entry><title>Teaching Learning</title><link href="/teaching-learning" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-24T19:56:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2011-05-24:teaching-learning</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I was privileged to attend the Conrad Foundation’s Spirit of
Innovation Awards (&lt;a href="http://conradawards.org/"&gt;http://conradawards.org/&lt;/a&gt;) at Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;. The program encourages teams of high school
students to address specific problems in the categories of Aerospace
Exploration, Clean Energy and Cyber Security. The students then pitch
their innovations and their business plans to judges, with the winning
team in each category receiving a \$5000 grant to fund their project&amp;nbsp;development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passion and Legitimacy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of my favorite speakers was Nick Tarascio, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; of AirEast Airways.
He stirred up the students (and particularly the teachers!) by
suggesting that maybe college was not just unnecessary to accomplish
their dreams, but actually (with the debt burden frequently incurred)
could stand in the way of their dreams. Was there a better way to learn
and to&amp;nbsp;succeed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick’s argument was that fundamentally &lt;em&gt;passion&lt;/em&gt; is what gives you
&lt;em&gt;legitimacy&lt;/em&gt;. There’s no shortage of work, just a shortage of people to
pay you. Are you interested in an industry or a subject? Stop waiting
for a job, go and offer to add value.  You can have conversations with
the greatest minds in history by reading &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;. He talked about his
involvement in projects like &lt;a href="http://www.skillshare.com"&gt;www.skillshare.com&lt;/a&gt; where anyone can
come and learn – if they want to – and Couchsurfing University, which
intentionally networks an already curious population and tells them to
come live with those who do what they want to learn. &lt;em&gt;Being surrounded
by the people who are talented and driven and know how to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LEARN&lt;/span&gt; is most
valuable thing&lt;/em&gt;, Nick emphasized to these&amp;nbsp;students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We believe in you and bring you here so you can learn how you &lt;em&gt;learn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a great way for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; (along with many of the other partners for the
event) to say: not ‘let us teach you something’ but &lt;em&gt;‘let us show you
how to be a&amp;nbsp;learner.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; could look like if this was the case – if we made a
way that those who wanted to learn could come and do so. Professional
degrees are obviously necessary for people in certain fields. But what
would happen at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; if we invested in those with the right motivation
and the right passion – instead of just the right degree? What would
change about the level of engagement of our own workforce - not even
talking about the public! Who could come contribute toward the vision
for space exploration who might otherwise have too many barriers in
front of&amp;nbsp;them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Innovation as Education Outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What’s particularly special about the Innovation Summit is the
organization’s vision to offer something truly different. They are
committed to &lt;strong&gt;transform the high school experience by combining
innovation, entrepreneurship, and education&lt;/strong&gt;. The Spirit of Innovation
Awards program invites students to think differently and create real,
innovative products to solve real&amp;nbsp;problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a recent visit to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IDEO&lt;/span&gt; in Palo Alto, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CA&lt;/span&gt;, we looked at their new open
innovation site: &lt;a href="http://www.openideo.com"&gt;www.openideo.com&lt;/a&gt;. All creative thinkers are invited
to sign on and participate in addressing real challenges. These
challenges, like &lt;em&gt;how can we better manage human waste in low-income
urban communities? How can we better connect food production and
consumption? How can we raise kids’ awareness of fresh food so they can
make better choices?&lt;/em&gt;, aren’t questions that need Ph.Ds – just passion,
and curiosity, and creative&amp;nbsp;thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started to think about how often in my education experience we are
making up problems for students to think about, rather than giving them
real problems. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has taken incredible strides with open innovation,
crowdsourcing some of our biggest problems to citizen scientists.
Couldn’t we extend our practice of open innovation to E&amp;amp;O too? &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
questions aren’t only technical aerospace issues. Technology could free
us to create a forum for two-way discussion. They may not be able to
answer questions like how to create radiation shielding for certain
spacecraft designs (or maybe they could!) But these students could
certainly make incredible contributions toward real questions about
engagement and awareness and direction of&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do we do this at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; – truly incentivize creating products that solve
real problems? Do we think of &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/about/index.html"&gt;education outreach&lt;/a&gt; as just content –
or as method too? Maybe what &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; should be teaching is not content so
much as it is inviting students to creative problem solving. OpenIDEO is
the place where ‘people design better, together.’ What if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was the
place where &lt;span style="color: #993300"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘people explore better,
together’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Spirit of Innovation" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Obama recently emphasized how the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; needs to be committed to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; education to get past this recession. “We want to start making
Science cool. I want people to feel about the next big energy
breakthrough and the next big Internet breakthrough the same way they
felt about the moonwalk,” he&amp;nbsp;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s so many problems, we’re not running out of problems,”
Foundation director Nancy Conrad said, emphasizing that you need to get
kids excited about Science, Math and Technology in order build a viable
workforce. “When you’ve got juiced kids who really want to do something,
they don’t know there’s a box. And then all they do is think outside the
box. This is where geeks turn into rockstars, and that’s the game
changer. That’s where you can change the culture of&amp;nbsp;students.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you think? Have we thought about how to turn geeks into
rockstars? About how to make room for the ones who really want to &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;something?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Education"></category><category term="Innovation"></category><category term="Open Innovation"></category><category term="Outreach"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Government 1 Year Status Infographic</title><link href="/open-government-1-year-status-infographic" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-23T07:17:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Sean Herron</name></author><id>tag:,2011-05-23:open-government-1-year-status-infographic</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government plan released on April 7, 2010, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;

Government into the agencies programs and projects. To celebrate the one
year anniversary of our plan, we’ve released a new infographic to
communicate our first year of progress toward becoming more transparent,
participatory, and collaborative. While we’ve set high goals, we’re
committed to incorporating open government into every facet of our

longer than we anticipated and extra time is required to fully realize
the goals. We hope this will clearly communicate our progress and keep

are fluid – you’ll see growth and movement as we work to determine the

exploration of asteroids.  Across the agency, experts are being called
into action to develop solutions to this new challenge. In particular,
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15, slated for October 17th-26th, will test new tools, techniques,
timelining approaches and communication technologies which could be
useful when humans approach asteroids in space. (Go &lt;a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn
more about the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Extreme Environment Mission Operation, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of visiting an asteroid challenges our experience like never
before. Gravity on an asteroid is negligible, so walking around on one
isn’t really an option. So anchoring to the surface will probably be
needed. But what to anchor to? They’re all made up of different
materials, some solid metal - others piles of rubble, and many are a
combination of rock, pebbles and dust. To the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 team, weak
gravity and diverse materials present problems whose solutions can be
experimented with on the ocean floor. And what better place to do that,
than the extreme conditions of a multi-day underwater mission at
Aquarius Reef Base in Key&amp;nbsp;Largo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 mission will be in October, and in an engineer’s mind, that
means there’s still time to iterate on designs. Today the engineering
team took some of those designs into the field. One of the devices
tested today was a “spacesuit waist ring simulator”. It acts as the
waist structure of a spacesuit would, except it’s attached to a diver
wearing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SCUBA&lt;/span&gt; tanks. It holds &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVA&lt;/span&gt; tools, provides stability against
structure, and even blocks some of the view, just as a spacesuit’s waist
ring would. So today, after constructing this device in labs and
workshops, it was finally time to put it in the water. After estimating
it’s weight and buoyancy (and yes, there were bets on whether it would
float!), it finally had its first taste of the ocean while still
dockside. It checked out, as did the other tools and giant fiberglass
“rockwall” that some of the experiments would mount to. So after the
paperwork was all signed off, the team set out to the&amp;nbsp;reef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_3335&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignright&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;300&amp;#8221;
caption=&amp;#8221;Engineers Prepare the Rock Wall, a surface to provide attach
points on the ocean floor, for it&amp;#8217;s trip into the
depths.&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GEDC0072_small.jpg" /&gt;][][/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When arriving at the site - on the same reef but some distance away from
Aquarius - the team lowered the rockwall to the ocean floor. Then,
one-by-one, test subjects, utility divers, and support divers worked
through their checklists and started the clocks on their dive. Astronaut
Mike Gernhardt, the test subject actually in the “rig”, found the
buoyancy to be near perfect (something that can sometimes take 30
minutes to correct), and started the experiments right away. The first
thing that struck everyone was the visibility - the bright sunny, calm
day helped the lighting - but the silt being kicked up made it
impossible to see further than 10 feet. For the most part this didn’t
affect the experiments, and the team pressed ahead. They tested
hand-over-hand translation with anchor points on the rockwall,
foot-restraint ingresses, anchoring in the silt to stabilize the setup,
and using a rigid standoff attached to the waist ring for body
stabilization. All while their time was ticking away - and they were not
able to speak to each other. This was shaping up to be quite the debrief&amp;nbsp;session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_3336&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignleft&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;250&amp;#8221; caption=&amp;#8221;A
test subject evaluates the spacesuit waist ring simulator, and uses a
mask that allows for multiple subjects to talk to each other (although
comm. was not used today).&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GEDC0042_small.jpg" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GEDC0042_small.jpg"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once back on the boat, the crew discussed what they had learned. Either
luck or excellent prediction had caused the rig to be perfectly buoyant,
but some stabilization was needed on the waist ring - and the fins -
they proved to be positively buoyant by sending the subject’s feet
sinking after they were removed. Mike was proud to share an interesting
discovery: while holding an excursion line anchored in two locations on
the “asteroid”, one could effectively pull against the surface and walk,
just as if there was gravity! There were other lessons learned, and many
adjustments that would need to be made overnight and in the next few
days, so the team used the trip back to base to rest and, well, talk
more about the big&amp;nbsp;picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess you could call it an engineering brainstorming session. Not one
with whiteboards, flowcharts and venn diagrams, but just a bunch of
people, passionate about space exploration, talking on a boat. They all
had huge variations in their backgrounds and individual training, and
just witnessed a sampling of how difficult it will be to someday explore
an asteroid. Were the issues they saw today the same ones we’ll face on
an asteroid? No, but some of them were strikingly analogous: The
near-zero visibility had a similar effect to what could happen after
touching the surface of a dusty asteroid. Body movements made on the
ocean floor while “almost” neutrally buoyant are similar to what
astronauts will face when moving across the surface of an uncharted
asteroid. And how will we know what anchoring techniques will be
effective? As the team neared the base on the shores of Key Largo, their
conversation shifted to the varieties of anchoring tools we use here on
Earth. Not knowing what kind of surfaces are out there is making us
consider a variety of approaches from many “analogous” situations here
on Earth: rock climbing, foundation repair, even drift&amp;nbsp;diving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[caption id=&amp;#8221;attachment_3331&amp;#8221; align=&amp;#8221;alignright&amp;#8221; width=&amp;#8221;250&amp;#8221;
caption=&amp;#8221;The engineering team used what was learned during the day, to
retool hardware needed for the next day&amp;#8217;s runs.&amp;#8221;][&lt;img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo_small.jpg" /&gt;]&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/photo_small.jpg"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was just a snapshot of one day of experiments in preparation for
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15. The countless hours that go into getting ready for a
mission are one of the many similarities to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s space missions.
Significant is the fact that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15 will mimic something that has
never been done by humans before. The question could be posed: Isn’t
visiting an asteroid just a combination of what we have done in the
past? Combine the weightlessness, tethering and translation techniques
on the International Space Station, and then add to that all of the
knowledge gained putting human feet on another world during the Apollo
program.&amp;nbsp;Right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not quite. The final discussions of the evening (after hours of
replanning, retooling and regrouping) were about how asteroid
exploration is definitely the most challenging of both worlds. Exploring
a possibly dusty, wholly unknown, completely uncertified, essentially
weightless, “surface” of an asteroid, will definitely be more
challenging then combining the sum of our lessons learned from the Moon
and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ISS&lt;/span&gt;. Those experiences under our belt will be the basis of much that
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; does in the future - but we all agree it’s a good thing we’re
learning how to hone our skills, here on&amp;nbsp;Earth.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="analogs"></category><category term="exploration"></category><category term="NEEMO"></category></entry><entry><title>Open Q OpenGov Summit</title><link href="/open-qa-on-fedscoop" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-05-10T20:14:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Nick Skytland</name></author><id>tag:,2011-05-10:open-qa-on-fedscoop</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; programs are specifically focused on open&amp;nbsp;government?&lt;/p&gt;

OpenGov a part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s everyday culture, rather than the territory of

research priorities, select missions, conduct research, develop
technology and make&amp;nbsp;discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government plan released on April 7, 2010, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
announced more than 150 milestones related to integrating Open
Government into the agency’s programs and projects. We recently released
a great infographic that outlines the progress each of the 22 different
programs that were a part of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government Initiative. While
we recognize the long-term nature of this movement, we’ve set high
short-term goals for the agency and committed to engaging the entirety
of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in the initiative. Open Government is definitely a long-term
process, not a short-term product, and we look forward to continuing to
make great progress at achieving our Open Government goals over the next&amp;nbsp;year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An upcoming Open Government event that we are very excited about is
Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK), which takes place on June 4-5, 2011.
RHoK is a unique collaboration between Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
and the World Bank dedicated to using technology to make the world a
better place by building a volunteer community of innovation. We are
organizing a weekend long marathon hacking event with multiple global
locations in order to bring together developers from all over the world
to hack on real-world problems. This is our 3rd RHoK event, and we are
excited to support an ever-growing global developer community who work
hand in hand with experts in disaster risk management to identify
critical global challenges, and develop software to respond to&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; leveraging technology to be more&amp;nbsp;open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology really opens the door for citizen engagement at a new level.
For example, we are experimenting with a number of open innovation
platforms that allow citizens to engage in critical discussions for the
agency through, particularly through virtual participation. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Centennial Challenges and the InnoCentive Pavilion are great examples of
leveraging technology to encourage the two-way conversation and engage
citizens in solving tough challenges. Social media has also been a vital
element to communicate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s story and formulate answers and ideas out
into the public&amp;nbsp;space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our biggest challenge is to embrace the disruptive innovation that comes
with new technology in order to improve the way we do business, the way
we communicate, and the way we collaborate. When it comes to leveraging
technology, we choose to spend our limited time and resources
experimenting with new capabilities that result in disruptive innovation
for the agency, rather then focus on sustaining innovation with existing
technology. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s internal cloud computing platform – Nebula – is one
of our flagship initiatives for the Open Government team and is a good
example of how we are embracing disruptive innovation in terms of
technology at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. Nebula is enabling a completely scalable
Infrastructure as a Service built especially for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s needs. The
agency is committing to evaluating “open source first” to accelerate the
software development process, saving time and money and increasing&amp;nbsp;interoperability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What lessons have you learned around opening &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our open government framework really strives to adapt to a changing
external environment, engage with citizens, and improve our agency
through collaborations and partnerships. The underlying motivation
behind the Open Government Initiative marks a shift in the way we do
business and we have learned so much in the first year of implementing
our Open Government Plan. We have a number of lessons learned to share,
two of which I’ll discuss&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have learned that there is a huge demand by citizens to
participate in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s mission as well as a large interest by our own
scientists, engineers and other professionals to utilize new engagement
platforms to solve complex problems. There are well over 500,000 people
around the globe who are already contributing their time, money, and
resources to work in the field and hundreds of thousands, if not
millions more, who are looking for additional opportunities to
participate in challenging and meaningful&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of the many possibilities created by a networked,
digital world and tapping into this community of passionate citizen
scientists is a a major opportunity for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. The more our own
scientists and engineers use the citizen engagement platforms, the more
we learn how to better engage the public (and our own employees) in our
mission. Well before the OpenGov Initiative was introduced, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; was
already engaged in prize competitions to accelerate innovation for
mission-relevant technologies, but we’ve seen an increase in interest in
unlocking the the power of community-based collaboration and open
innovation platforms over the past year to tackle hardware and software
development and scientific&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have seen this as a opportunity to gather and analyze information
in new ways or unlock solutions to complex problems using new approaches
that we may have not been able to do&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second lesson learned is a better understanding of the relationship
between technology innovation and changes to our internal policies,
procedures and processes that govern the way we do our work. Although
their are many examples of how Open Government applies has identified
areas to improve the way we work and thereby increase technological
innovation, I’ll point to the use of Open Source Software development as
a specific&amp;nbsp;example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has been utilizing and developing open source software for quite
some time and doing so has already provided numerous benefits to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.
However, we recognize that the full benefits of open source can only be
achieved if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is able to establish the processes, policies, and
culture needed to encourage and support open source development. Because
open source is an inherently transparent, participatory, and
collaborative approach that is revolutionizing the way software is
created, improved, and used, it fits well within the mandate of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
Open Government Initiative. We know that the full potential of open
source software development will require identifying new ways for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
to expand its open source activities beyond just releasing software only
when its&amp;nbsp;completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We held our first Open Source Summit in March 2011 as a way to bring
leaders in the open source community to discuss the challenges with the
existing open source policy framework, and propose modifications that
would make it easier for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to develop, release, and use open source
software. There was a lot of interest – although the event was
originally planned to be a small discussion amongst 60 industry leaders,
over 700 people participated in the event, 545 of them who participated&amp;nbsp;online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event brought together engineers and policy makers across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and
respected members of the open source community to discuss the challenges
with the existing open source policy framework, and propose
modifications that would make it easier for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to develop, release,
and use open source software. We used the opportunity to learn from the
leaders in the open source community. More than 47 topics were suggested
for discussion with more than 638 votes cast. The topmost challenges
were discussed and debated in further detail, producing more than 17
major issues with 66 substantive&amp;nbsp;solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear that our internal policies, procedures and processes do not
necessarily reflect the best practices of the open source community and
therefore do not encourage the internal development and release of open
source software. Moving forward, we hope to publicly release the
proceedings from the summit and work to update our policies, procedures
and processes at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; – based on the feedback from this summit – to
better embrace Open Source development and accelerate technological
innovation at the&amp;nbsp;agency.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>NASA Technical Reports</title><link href="/nasa-technical-reports-server" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-04-26T14:35:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Ali Llewellyn</name></author><id>tag:,2011-04-26:nasa-technical-reports-server</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a clear mandate for the &amp;#8220;widest practicable and appropriate

one can see that there is no significant fall off in use in terms of
both day of the week and time of day. Over a quarter of the traffic to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTRS&lt;/span&gt; comes from foreign internet domains, the top five being: United
Kingdom, Australia, Germany, China, and Japan. There is no surprise that
Google registers as the top referrer to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTRS&lt;/span&gt; at 14% after direct
traffic. This percentage share rises to 31% after adding in the rest of
Google&amp;#8217;s international presence. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTRS&lt;/span&gt; is also a source to Science.gov
and Worldwidescience.org. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NTRS&lt;/span&gt; has a very strong brand name as shown by

little engineering and produced near-full-scale systems that have been
demonstrated. In 2008 &lt;span class="amp"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; again in early 2010, systems that could produce
oxygen from lunar soils (or their terrestrial analogs) were tested at a

Administration released its Open Government Plan, in response to the
White House directive issued in December 2009, which required federal
agencies to take immediate, specific steps to achieve key milestones in
transparency, participation, and collaboration. &lt;!--more--&gt;  This
directive hardwired accountability into executive agencies, instructing
each to open its doors and data to the American people. More information
about the White House directive can be found
at: &lt;a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/open"&gt;www.whitehouse.gov/open&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over 50 years, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has nurtured and developed a rich culture of
openness, fostering collaboration among scientists and sharing with the
public at large the excitement surrounding scientific discoveries,
aeronautics, and space. From developing open source software and the
largest federal cloud computing platform to creating new incentivized
challenges for talented and interested members of the public, we’re
striving to incorporate open government into every facet of our mission.
 To celebrate the anniversary, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is providing a detailed assessment
and infographic marking its progress toward more than 150 milestones on
19 projects and 3 flagship initiatives.  The infographic includes a
status of all projects, as well as new information about &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOIA&lt;/span&gt;
process, released data sets, space act agreements and use of social
media. The full infographic can be viewed and downloaded

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.nasa.gov/533962main_opengov_tools_for_the_citizen.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The infographic demonstrates &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s commitment to make the &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/opendata/"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt;
available – and make it useful. The visualization process balances
design *and* function to communicate more effectively to a wider
audience. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s vital that as a worldwide resource &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is ready to
communicate with the most innovative methods available. Infographics
represent an opportunity to be both engaging and insightful. By
combining &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s data and a story about how it affects us all, we
thought this infographic should convey the sensibility at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; that
their work isn&amp;#8217;t just about the high-tech but also about the everyday.
From the big city to the calm desert, every part of the country has the
power to make something great,&amp;#8221; explains Dennis Bonilla, Design and
Multimedia Manager who led the infographic design team. &amp;#8221;We expect to
see great things from Citizen Scientists, and we&amp;#8217;re ready to help equip
them for that&amp;nbsp;journey.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Government isn’t just a project or a certain group of people who
enjoy working in a different way – it’s a commitment by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to do its
work differently. Open Government is a statement that we value
increasing transparency, collaboration, and participation in every place
possible across the agency, and that we acknowledge that our technology,
policy, and culture will be better for having done so. Open Government
is our belief that our agency - and our government - is better when we
are fully engaged in it, talking about it and contributing to&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would you like to see on our next &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government&amp;nbsp;infographic?&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Infographic"></category><category term="Open Data"></category><category term="Opengov"></category></entry><entry><title>Building V</title><link href="/building-v" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-04-12T21:12:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Stuart Engelhardt</name></author><id>tag:,2011-04-12:building-v</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since I work from a variety of locations throughout the week, as I
support different customers and types of activities, I figured I would
make a few notes about what I would like to see as a new facility at
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;:  Building&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8220;V&amp;#8221; in Building V is for Virtual.  As more and more of us operate in
a half dozen different locations throughout the week, we need more
mobility.  But we also need more of a Versatile presence too.  E-mail,
tweets, voicemail, and even to some extent IMs, are not sufficient
enough to directly engage in an active dialogue.  And my main &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; phone
has severe technological limitations which does not support my mobility
(it cannot be forwarded or set to multi-ring).  So this is where I need
a better way to let people to interface with me, and vice versa -
especially mobile&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had a Virtual office, in Building V, people could call that one
phone, preferably a VoIP phone, and it would multi-ring anywhere I
configure for it to ring.  This is something many people have on their
corporate phones already, but we need it for our &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; activities as
well.  Few people care where I am, they just want to get ahold of me,
and this would go a long way to helping them do that.  People also don&amp;#8217;t
want to dial multiple numbers to find me - if they don&amp;#8217;t get me by phone
the first try, they usually resort to e-mail or just forget about it -
and that isn&amp;#8217;t helping anyone innovate or&amp;nbsp;collaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had a Virtual office, in Building V, people could poke their head
in through the door anytime they want, to say, &amp;#8220;Hi, what&amp;#8217;s up?&amp;#8221;  I would
love to configure MacBook Pro to connect to a virtual office space where
I could still see people face-to-face.  We need that opportunity to walk
down the (virtual) hall and see or colleagues and management.  It also
helps to give the virtual workspace a more organic&amp;nbsp;feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would also hope Building V would be a hub for a handful of Virtual
Conference Rooms.  We have one collaborative workspace in Building 29
already, &amp;#8220;The Sp.ace&amp;#8221; as Nick dubbed it.  Great place.  I just wish I
could get to it virtually too.  Perhaps Building V could have several
&amp;#8220;themed&amp;#8221; collaboration centers, where people could pick the right theme
for their topic or activity for that day, and join others, virtually or
physically, interested in a similar theme.  These would connect via a
two-way video hub, so people could go by the Collaborative Workspace
place, or could video conference in anytime they want.  Virtual
Conference Rooms could also be used in conjunction with official
Building V-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;IRC&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IM&lt;/span&gt;-type multi-user chat&amp;nbsp;rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last item I would like to see in Building V is a bunch of Virtual
White Boards, something like multi-user version of &lt;a href="http://skitch.com/"&gt;Skitch&lt;/a&gt;.  One
active board that people could share in writing or drawing on, and then
save snapshots that can be pulled up later for reference.  Many great
ideas start out with rough sketches and wireframes on a white board , it
seems to me to be something that would be beneficial moving&amp;nbsp;forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I dream of the day we have something like a Building V - I would be one
of the first virtual inhabitants.  It would give me both a better single
point of virtual contact, and freedom while mobile - helping me worry
less about missing important communications.  And at the same time,
Building V would give me more ways to express ideas creatively, and
mature them with the participation of fellow virtual&amp;nbsp;collaborators.&lt;/p&gt;

Meetings confined to the meeting room?
Not so much anymore. Over the past decade, decision-making boards and
widely attended conferences, along with the average team meetings, are
rarely restricted to the people in the physical room. Rather,
teleconferencing technologies promise to save dwindling travel budgets,
connect distributed teams, gather worldwide experts to a one-of-a-kind
summits or simply make it possible for really busy people to be in two
places at&amp;nbsp;once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Virtual” participation isn’t new. Years (and years) ago New York
Telephone coined the phrase “&lt;em&gt;we are all connected&lt;/em&gt;”, and that
philosophy has held true when businesses used analog desktop
conferencing calls to bring together their shareholders and partners
from around the world. But lately there has been an influx of new
technologies which really push the limit of what’s possible. High-def
video conferencing, shared desktops, and unlimited cellular voice plans
have all tried to convince us to work from home – or cover more meetings
than we have ever thought&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[![An old Blackberry leaning against an older see-thru touch-tone&amp;nbsp;phone.][]][]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And let me tell you, &lt;span style="color: #888888"&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #333333"&gt;these technolo&lt;/span&gt;gies are really
great&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #c0c0c0"&gt;, and can&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span
style="color: #ffffff"&gt;make us&amp;nbsp;all……&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Excuse me. Can the speaker please get closer to the&amp;nbsp;mic?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was&amp;nbsp;that?!?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s the statement of desperation; a last resort after maxing out cell
phone volume, finding an empty gate at the airport, or closing the door
to the home office. Not wanting to interrupt - but driven by a need to
be an integral part of the conversation – these words are a verbal
request that a little more &lt;span
style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;respect&lt;/span&gt; be given to those “on
the net”, not just that the microphone be&amp;nbsp;moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it’s not just voiced information that technology can help transmit.
&lt;em&gt;If you look back to an email that we all received in the past 4-5
months or so, you can see a list of examples of&amp;nbsp;these…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Um, yeah… Can’t find it. Do you just have it on a&amp;nbsp;stick?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahh, the stick. A portable hard drive that bypasses almost every layer
of security between the core processor of a government computer and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;8GB&lt;/span&gt;
of unknown content. It’s not the only way to transfer files, but moving
a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;500MB&lt;/span&gt; movie file in 30 seconds flat (while in a wireless dead zone)
really makes you feel like it’s&amp;nbsp;2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Oh, and please keep this between the group in the room and the few of
us on the phone, but at the end of 2011 we will be releasing the
best &lt;strong&gt;[[beep-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEEP&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8230;Uhh… Who just&amp;nbsp;joined?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you&amp;#8217;re the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Administrator, a division chief, astronaut or
intern, everyone makes the same entrance: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;beep-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEEP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”. For that
matter, they all make same exit: “&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEEP&lt;/span&gt;-beep&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;”. I wonder if a
physical meeting’s conversation would be different if its participants
put on ski masks before entering the room? &amp;nbsp;Naaaa…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So maybe the technology isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Maybe we should
just revert to the old ways of getting people in a room together and let
them use their humanly instinctive communication skills. Maybe we’re
just attempting too darn much with technology these&amp;nbsp;days&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8230;Or maybe technology isn’t the only&amp;nbsp;factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introducing a new tool prompts questions like, “Is it cross-platform?”,
“How secure is it?”, or “How much does it cost?”. Or, when seeking a
tool to fill a gap, simply “What are the requirements?” But it&amp;#8217;s often
impossible to predict &lt;span
style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;how&lt;/span&gt; people will use the tool.
As individuals and teams start using a new product, solutions to its
barriers are collectively learned, norms are established based on prior
experiences and current leadership, and eventually a &lt;strong&gt;culture of use&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;emerges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Christer-on-EVA-2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Christer Fugelsang on a spacewalk during STS-116" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Christer-on-EVA-2.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In the past I’ve had a keen
interest in the cultures that are created around communication
technology at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and in the near future I’ll be posting more about
how these specific technologies are used across our Agency, with the
hopes that it creates a &lt;strong&gt;conversation about the culture&lt;/strong&gt; of their&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is just like many other large organizations, doing
the best we can to communicate between two boardrooms thousands of miles
apart. In most cases we can compare notes with the real world, since
&amp;#8220;there&amp;#8217;s an app for that&amp;#8221; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; probably isn&amp;#8217;t the first one to use
it. But there are some things that separate us from the pack. A lot of
the communications technologies that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; uses are &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VERY&lt;/span&gt; unique: from the
hundreds of accessible voice loops fed to every Space Shuttle flight
controller’s console, to the strange and sometimes debilitating effect
that microphone placement has on the voice of an astronaut in a
spacesuit. And hey, sorry there, satellite-phone-toting reporter on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CNN&lt;/span&gt;
- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; &lt;em&gt;invented&lt;/em&gt; speed-of-light lag&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these applications and challenges, however general to the
world or specific to pushing the frontiers of spaceflight, have a common
thread – they&amp;#8217;re trying to use state of the art technology to get
information out of one mind and into someone else’s. If the habits,
reactions, and other characteristics of those minds aren’t taken into
account, there’s a good chance the culture of use will foster rejection,
and the technology will be seen as “just another fancy&amp;nbsp;toy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I ask anyone who made it this far down the post: what &amp;#8220;fancy toys&amp;#8221;
are the most useful to you as a “Virtual Participant”?  Any tools you
can’t live without, or wish had never been invented? Share your stories
in the comments. We’ll pick a few hot topics and expand on their culture
of use here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; in a future blog&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Government at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is committed to making &lt;a href="http://open.nasa.gov/opendata/"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; available and
enabling the public to engage that data. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/"&gt;Jet Propulsion
Laboratory&lt;/a&gt; is using video game technology to immerse the general
public and mission personnel in the solar system and beyond. The
Visualization Technology Applications and Development Group is creating
3D environments full of real &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; mission data, permitting exploration
of the planet – and the&amp;nbsp;cosmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eyes on the Earth” and “Eyes on the Solar System” are cross-platform,
real-time, 3D-interactive applications that run inside a Web browser.
Combining real-time spacecraft data and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; imagery, the applications
give users a unique and extraordinary view of the solar system by
virtually transporting them across space and time to make first-person
observations of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; spacecraft in action as they explore the planets,
moons, asteroids and comets. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;YOU&lt;/span&gt; can be an armchair astronaut and
explore what&amp;#8217;s happening all over earth and in space -&amp;nbsp;real-time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Hundreds of gigabytes of spacecraft trajectory data, orbital
parameters, planetary maps and other fascinating resources are available
to the public via portals like the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDS&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NAIF&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HORIZONS&lt;/span&gt;. However,
difficulty in processing and interpreting the various formats of that
data put a barrier to access between it and the general public,” said
Doug Ellison, the team’s Visualization&amp;nbsp;Producer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we&amp;#8217;ve done with Eyes on the Solar System is take that data, put it
all in context and wrap it in an experience that we think lets the
public enjoy it and use it with almost no pre-existing knowledge of what
that data is or how to make sense of it. It&amp;#8217;s the very same data that
the engineers use to navigate their spacecraft across the solar system.
By unlocking it with &amp;#8216;Eyes on the Solar System&amp;#8217;, we&amp;#8217;re letting the
public come along for the ride and that&amp;#8217;s a very powerful tool for both
education and&amp;nbsp;engagement.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered how many satellites are in orbit around the earth and how
they intersect? Where Voyager 2 looks like and what it’s seeing? What it
would look like to fly along real time with various satellites? What the
actual data is about global temperature, sea level, the ozone layer –
and what it means all put together? How the solar system is actually
moving in real time? In these apps, /you/ control space and time – and
all the data is&amp;nbsp;real.&lt;/p&gt;

I remember camp counselors
amused when I would turn off the shower to take the time to shampoo my
hair; it felt like a waste to just let it run. I almost had a panic
attack at a water fountain in a Barnes and Noble once, the first summer
I came back from Afghanistan. The water was running continuously for
some reason, and it wouldn&amp;#8217;t stop. I had just been in a place where so
many didn&amp;#8217;t have access to water, where we saved the last inch of our
daily bottle to brush our teeth at night - and here we wasted it so&amp;nbsp;mindlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember walking through rice paddies in rural Java with other women
who had traveled long distances with long-reused containers to get clean
water. We were very careful about what we consumed there, but I left
Indonesia with a case of giardia that took weeks to get over. 1 in 8
people in the world lack access to clean water supplies. 3.57 million
people die each year from water-related diseases. It&amp;#8217;s not just that
they get sick - they &lt;em&gt;die&lt;/em&gt;. 98% of these deaths are in the developing&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I work for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, and we can turn urine into water and have a big
party to celebrate it. There isn&amp;#8217;t available water in space, either,
just like in many parts of the world, but the six astronauts who live on
the space station can create their own water - and it&amp;#8217;s more pure than
many of us get out of the tap. One of my colleagues plans and implements
community water purification systems in Rwanda and applies the lessons
learned there to creating water out of lunar regolith. The moon isn&amp;#8217;t
that different from parts of rural Africa: bare, rocky, little water, no
infrastructure. Clean, efficient technologies are providing clean water
for Rwanda, and those same experiences will be applied to water
production and life support on the moon. Creativity, technology, and
commitment to a purpose make all the&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t think technology is the answer to everything; sometimes it is
the less technical solution that is most sustainable. My daily life is
teaching me, though, that we have an abundance of readily available
technology that could meet all sorts of human needs, if we will be
inventive in our methodology and our application. I&amp;#8217;m so excited to get
engaged daily in collaborations between students, businesspeople and
scientists collaborating to meet technical and operational needs - and
often social needs at the same time. What affects me the most, though,
is the constant reminder to not just find a technology, but to &lt;strong&gt;engage
your users&lt;/strong&gt; to find a solution. Technology is not the agent of change -
people are. But technology can often put all the right tools in their
hands to change their world - and maybe their whole&amp;nbsp;universe.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="Social Innovation"></category></entry><entry><title>NASA Open Source Summit</title><link href="/nasa-open-source-summit" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2011-04-05T03:18:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Chris Gerty</name></author><id>tag:,2011-04-05:nasa-open-source-summit</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This past week, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; hosted it’s first Open Source Summit at Ames
Research Center. The event was an overwhelming success and it really set
the stage for the future of Open Source at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;. If you didn’t have a
chance to attend, the event brought together engineers and policy makers
across &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and respected members of the open source community to
discuss the challenges with the existing open source policy framework,
and propose modifications that would make it easier for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to develop,
release, and use open source software. The summit was an attempt at
something new and revolutionary - we reached out to the public and
actively involved them in a critical conversation related to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event brought together over 700 registered participants, 545 of them
who participated online.We were honored to have top minds in Open Source
at the event&amp;nbsp;including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pascal Finette, Director of Mozilla&amp;nbsp;Labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Robert Sutor, Vice President of Open Systems at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IBM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chris Wanstrath, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CEO&lt;/span&gt; and co-founder of&amp;nbsp;Github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brian Stevens, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CTO&lt;/span&gt; and Vice President of Worldwide Engineering at
    Red&amp;nbsp;Hat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;David Wheeler, Institute for Defense&amp;nbsp;Analysis/DoD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linda Cureton, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIO&lt;/span&gt; for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terry Fong, Director of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames Research Center’s Intelligent
    Robotics&amp;nbsp;Group&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Patrick Hogan, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; World&amp;nbsp;Wind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We witnessed the beneficial interaction of physical and virtual
participants coming together and engaging in very productive debates and
brainstorming solutions to our mostpressing challenges. This diverse
community had multiple ways to join the conversation: watch the live
feed via Ustream, comment through chat, join breakout discussions via
Maestro audio conference, and submit feedback on Google docs to shape
the policy discussions. More than 47 topics were suggested for
discussion with more than 638 votes cast. The topmost challenges were
discussed and debated in further detail, producing more than 66
substantivesolutions in response to those&amp;nbsp;barriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The event also had a large public reach. Within the last 24 hours,
twitter alone generated 3,199,713 impressions reaching an audience of
1,190,435 followers. There were over 1,200 tweets tracking the many
discussions and extending the conversation even further into the public&amp;nbsp;sphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open source brings numerous benefits to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; software projects,
including increased software quality, reduced development costs, faster
development cycles, and reduced barriers to public-private collaboration
through new opportunities to commercialize &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; technology. This
inherently transparent, participatory, and collaborative approach is
revolutionizing the way software is created, improved, and used.
Although open source release has already provided numerous benefits to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, the full benefits of open source can only be realized if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is
able to establish the processes, policies, and culture needed to
encourage and support open source development. This will require
expanding open source activities beyond releasing software only after
completion and finding new ways to support two-way collaboration with an
open development community throughout the entire software&amp;nbsp;lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;

on March 27th, 2011, “&lt;em&gt;you are breaking the law of you don’t consider
open source software development in your projects&lt;/em&gt;” – and he’s
absolutely right! So that got me thinking, how many Open Source software
projects has &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; actually released in the last year? Here’s the answer:
20. What’s disappointing to me is that the majority of the official
release came from only one center – and in that regard Ames Research
Center is truly a trailblazer at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; when it comes to Open Source
Software. Our hope in Open Government is that this number will star to
exponentially increase moving forward and that all &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; centers will
start to participate. We recognize that many people many not release
with an open source license because there are too many barriers in place
to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are an invested stakeholder in helping solve that problem, but it
will take some time. Therefore, I wanted to inspire you with concrete
examples of the open source success stories from around the agency. The
list below is the 20 projects that released software open source this
past year (the release date is listed in parenthesis). These are the
trailblazers! These projects are all active and it’s likely that most of
the people who worked through the current software release process are
still involved. I encourage you to reach out to the project leaders,
learn from their experience, and let them serve as an example of what is
possible in your space&amp;nbsp;program!&lt;/p&gt;

participation far beyond natural boundaries. &lt;a href="http://trainlikeanastronaut.org"&gt;Mission X: Train Like an
Astronaut&lt;/a&gt; is an international outreach challenge aligning agencies
worldwide to address the critical world health issue of childhood
obesity by offering students the opportunity to ‘train like an
astronaut.’ Each of the space agencies committed to take their
particular expertise to address this global issue by engaging kids in a
vision for space&amp;nbsp;exploration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foundation of Mission X is 18 physical and science activities,
developed in tandem between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; educators and subject matter experts,
that focus on the core physical and mental skills that equip astronauts
for spaceflight. Teams of students learn principles of healthy eating,
exercise and compete for points by finishing training modules. Students
also practice scientific reasoning and teamwork while participating in
hands-on training that targets strength, endurance, coordination,
balance and spatial awareness. Mission X challenges students to be more
physically active; increases awareness of the importance of lifelong
health and conditioning; teaches students how fitness plays a vital role
in human performance for exploration; and inspires and motivates
students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and&amp;nbsp;mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mission X partners prioritized international collaboration as well
as global participation. The pilot project, stretching across 10
countries and 15 agencies, was one of the largest non-technical
collaborations across the space program. Mission X also offered a widely
interactive website (built on open source software) where team members,
teachers, and the public could share stories, photos, and videos
regarding their training in 8 languages. The unique platform makes the
multilingual curriculum widely available and offers the public a clear
window into the students’ experience and lessons&amp;nbsp;learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of Mission X, many of the teams logged in from 4
different countries for a live downlink from the International Space
Station with astronauts Cady Coleman and Paolo Nespoli. The crewmembers
demonstrated many of the skills the students had learned, answered
questions, and made space real to kids whose imaginations were full of
everything that could be possible. The project team’s commitment to work
together to engage more than 4000 students in physical and mental
training for exploration showed the agencies – and the students – what
was&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

code to allow anyone to make improvements and is revolutionizing the way
software is created, improved, and used. The open source software
movement is inherently transparent, participatory, and collaborative.
Open source at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; gives the public direct and ongoing access to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;
technology. Its adoption by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; also helps lower the barrier to entry
into space by enabling private industry to better make use of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major goal of the Open Government Office is to work to establish a
comprehensive open source policy within the agency that enables
innovation and collaboration between both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees, contractors,
and the public.This would shift our open source activities from its
one-way direction of giving the public access to finalized software
products, to allowing two-way collaboration as part of the development
process. The benefits of allowing the public to assist in development of
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; software include increased software quality, accelerated software
development, and a higher rate of technology transfer both to and from
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2011, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; hosted an Open Source Summit at Ames Research
Center. Focused on addressing the core challenges &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is encountering
behind open source development and producing real, actionable solutions,
the Summit brought together many of the best minds in development from
both inside and outside the agency. Over 600 in-person and virtual
attendees collaborated on a variety of issues including &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ITAR&lt;/span&gt; policies,
governance, and risk&amp;nbsp;assessments.&lt;/p&gt;

aim of illuminating the vibrant community of dedicated women workers who
play a vital role at the agency, the site features stories of women
overcoming almost every obstacle imaginable to pursue their dreams and
make a difference in the world. In the future, we hope that the website
will support a collaborative and supportive community of women at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;,

&lt;p&gt;The Women@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; website was created in response to the Executive Order,
signed March 11, 2009, establishing the White House Council on Women and
Girls. Chaired by the heads of every agency and major White House office
across the federal government, the Council aims to provide a coordinated
federal response to issues that have a distinct impact on women and
girls. Working across all executive departments and agencies, the
Council reviews and recommends changes to policies that have a distinct
impact on women in the workforce and assists in the development of
legislative and policy proposals of special importance to women and&amp;nbsp;girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Women@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; website was created by the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Open Government team in

planetary destinations. The crewmembers of this mission will live in the
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOAA&lt;/span&gt; Aquarius habitat, which has been used by Marine Biologists to study
coral and marine life for years. As part of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt;-15, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is

and others to capture unprecedented images of the reef and engage
citizen scientists to assist in the task of identifying and cataloguing
the diverse marine life in the&amp;nbsp;region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizens will be able to help by viewing high-resolution images of the
ocean floor and circling regions of coral, tagging information about its
appearance, and comparing it to any past images which might be available
to determine its growth (or destruction) over time. Additionally, during
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NEEMO&lt;/span&gt; mission itself, Aquanauts will traverse over regions and supply
more detailed observations and imagery. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; will use the data cataloged
by citizen scientists to help guide future mission time lines and
traverse paths toward the most scientifically rich regions of the reef.
If successful, this model of performing real science before and after
human missions can be duplicated for extraterrestrial&amp;nbsp;destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A community of \~400,000 citizen scientists will have an opportunity to

&lt;p&gt;Under President Obama’s Open Government Initiative, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; is exploring
new ways to share with the public the exciting science we take part in
every day. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has a long history of sharing its discoveries with the
public, but figuring out how to present it in a way that is both easy to
understand and simple to use frequently poses a challenge. By partnering
with private industry, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; has the opportunity to take advantage of
existing technology innovations that can deliver science data in a
format that is more publically&amp;nbsp;consumable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; and Microsoft unveiled the latest version of WorldWide
Telescope, featuring the highest resolution and most complete map of
Mars images ever released. Over 13,000 images from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s HiRISE camera
on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, each with a resolution of about 100
times that of a 10 megapixel point-and-shoot camera, have been mapped
onto a 3D globe of the Martian surface. They offer unparalleled views of
spectacular surface features, including imagery of the Mars Phoenix
Lander site and Olympus Mons – the highest peak in our solar&amp;nbsp;system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/resource/1013251" /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soaring above Mars in WorldWide&amp;nbsp;Telescope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing all of these incredible images to user’s desktop computers is
not an easy feat. With hundreds of terabytes of data available, the
images must be made available “on demand” as users fly across the
Martian surface, only loading terrain data when necessary. To accomplish
this, the intelligent robotics group at Ames Research Center turned to
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s &lt;a href="http://nebula.nasa.gov/"&gt;Nebula&lt;/a&gt; cloud computing platform. Nebula provides flexible and
efficient science-class compute and storage services that easily scale
to meet the needs of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; scientists and researchers. Nebula was one of
three Flagship Initiatives in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s Open Government Plan and is one of
the primary tools that is enabling &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; to more easily collaborate with
private industry, academia and engage with the public in ways never
before&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;

![Nebula is located in modular shipping containers.][]

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;

*Nebula is located in modular shipping containers at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; Ames Research
Center.*

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nebula turned the 13,000 images from HiRISE into half a billion smaller
images that can be served in real-time to a broadband connection.
Creating this huge mosaic took two weeks of number crunching on 114 of
Nebula’s central processing units. The project demonstrated the powerful
capabilities of Nebula, which has been utilized in situations as diverse
as hosting federal spending data on USAspending.gov to providing a
mechanism for amateur astronomers across the globe to upload their
images of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LCROSS&lt;/span&gt; impact on the lunar south&amp;nbsp;pole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology innovations like Nebula are integral in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s efforts to
partner with industry to create products and services that make &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;’s
data more easily consumable to public audiences. As we move forward in
creating an environment of even greater transparency and participation
at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;, we hope to deliver even more engaging experiences that provide
the American public with better insight into the cosmos, planet earth,
and the work going on at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hale’s blog post&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100346538" title="NPR Story on Barrier Analysis video"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPR&lt;/span&gt; story&lt;/a&gt;. There&amp;#8217;s even a good summary
of its background &lt;a href="http://www.opennasa.com/2009/01/28/barriers-to-innovation-and-inclusion/"&gt;here on OpenNASA&lt;/a&gt;. It has been great to see the
conversation that has started among &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; employees and the general
public alike. The other teams also had some very interesting (if not
quite as controversial) contributions relating to the inner-workings of
the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; Community. They looked internally at challenges such as
Recruiting, Mentoring, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;IT&lt;/span&gt; Infrastructure, or Work-Life Fit. Personally,
I had the privilege of working with 12 others to study the latter, and
in the spirit of being open, I&amp;#8217;d like to share with the OpenNASA readers
the results of our&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Work-Life Fit team was made up of employees from across the center,
civil servants and contractors, including some subject matter experts
and a facilitator to help keep the varying perspectives focused on our
goal. That goal was to conduct a short study, addressing three general&amp;nbsp;areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Review existing Work-Life Fit offerings to employees at the Johnson
Space&amp;nbsp;Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give consideration as to what other flexibilities should be&amp;nbsp;included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Develop ideas on how to market current flexibilities, encouraging
wider acceptance and&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the challenge to think outside of PowerPoint for our presentation,
we decided pretty early to put together a video that caught the
audience’s attention, and highlighted our key findings and
recommendations. Knowing we would have folks in the room that needed to
immediately discuss our suggestions, we accompanied the video with a
summary &lt;a href="http://10.128.27.6/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/work-life-fit-one-pager-final.doc" title="Work-Life Fit One Pager"&gt;one-pager&lt;/a&gt;, and of course we had a more detailed &lt;a href="http://10.128.27.6/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/work-life-fit-white-paper-final.doc" title="Work-Life Fit White Paper"&gt;white
paper&lt;/a&gt; that fully explained the research that brought us to our&amp;nbsp;conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our video was split into two parts, the first of which reflected on why
fitting work and life together effectively was important – and
particularly at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt;/Johnson Space Center. The videos on YouTube have a
“Watch in High Quality” link, so make sure to click just to the
bottom-right of the video. Here’s Part One, which we showed to introduce
the subject of Work-Life Fit at the Johnson Space Center (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHyRA8Tx24I#"&gt;Work-Life Fit at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;: Part 1 (YouTube&amp;nbsp;video)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the interlude we asked the audience a few prying questions to
help communicate some of the “eureka moments” we had. First we wanted to
convey the difference between Work-Life Fit, and Work-Life
Balance/Segregation, so we asked how many people who were given a
Blackberry for work, used it to communicate on occasion with their
spouse. We then asked if anyone ever carried a separate cell phone for
work and personal calls. To us, this was a simple example of the
difference between integrating, and balancing. After a few more of those
types of questions we came back around to the use of technology by
asking how many people used a cell phone, pager, or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDA&lt;/span&gt; in college or
high school to be more productive in work &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; life. Very few hands
went up. Our point here was that 100% of new-hires are familiar with the
use of these technologies. This younger generation can be very effective
when given flexibilities which allow them to manage their life and&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second video was a few minutes longer, and specifically addressed
our recommendations and gave a preview of some of the data we used to
make our conclusions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0_z8z_smTI&amp;amp;feature=related#"&gt;Work-Life Fit at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt;: Part 2 (YouTube&amp;nbsp;video)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that these are only recommendations, and not sanctioned or
accepted by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NASA&lt;/span&gt; as of yet. Hopefully after presenting to the Joint
Leadership Team we have opened a few eyes and sparked some conversations
within the gates of the Johnson Space Center, and maybe by posting it
here we’ll even get some feedback from outside the gates. So after
watching the video and/or reading our written publications which
accompany it, what are your thoughts? How does the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;JSC&lt;/span&gt; community compare
to others with respect to Work-Life Fit? How do you fit work with your
personal&amp;nbsp;lives?&lt;/p&gt;
