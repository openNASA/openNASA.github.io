						<p><em>Emerging efforts and studies demonstrate that art plays a critical role
in enhancing science, technology, engineering, and math (<span class="caps">STEM</span>)
education, an important <span class="caps">NASA</span> and <span class="caps">U.S.</span> goal of great importance, given
that current <span class="caps">U.S.</span> youth lag far behind other industrialized countries in
math and science skills. Partnering science with art also encourages the
development of creative and critical thinking, problem solving, and
communication skills. These abilities are becoming increasingly
necessary to ensure high performance in a rapidly changing global
society. Thus, educational approaches combining space science topics
with art could provide an effective method to inspire youth to
seek education and careers in <span class="caps">STEM</span>-requiring fields, and to approach
them innovatively and&nbsp;creatively.</em></p>
<p><em>In addition, the integration of science with art can provide a more
effective outreach tool for youth and adults than using science alone.
Prompting artistic expression with information about our current
knowledge of human space exploration has the potential to reach a wide
audience of youth. The resulting artwork can then be used as
a communication tool to inspire even more people of all ages, enhancing
awareness, interest, and support for human space flight. The artwork can
also provide new ideas or renewed inspiration to those already working
in the space industry. In the past, many of our science programs in
human space</em> <em>exploration have been inspired by the works of artists.</em><br />
-Jancy&nbsp;McPhee</p>
<p>It’s exciting to see <span class="caps">NASA</span> and our partner agencies exploring new
territory at the intersection of <span class="caps">STEM</span> and art. Now in its second year,
the <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/humansinspaceart/index.shtml.en">Humans in Space Youth Art Competition</a>continues to invite young
people all over the world to think about the future of human space
flight and to creatively communicate their ideas - and then promises to
share those ideas with the world. By including the next generation in
the planning of the future, the competition aims to enhance their
awareness, interest in and support for human space flight, and to allow
their ideas to begin shaping the future&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>The current 2012 competition encourages young people from 10 to 18 years
of age to submit visual, literary, musical and video artwork expressing
their vision of how humans will use science and technology in the future
to explore space and uncover its mysteries. Their submissions will be
judged by an international panel including artists, scientists,
teachers, engineers, astronauts and others. The winning artwork will be
woven into displays and performances designed to relay the young
artists’ messages to other young people and adults around the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Interested in entering? Competition guidelines are found <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/humansinspaceart/guidelines/index.shtml.en">here</a> and
you can follow the event on Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HumansInSpaceArt">here</a>. Be inspired. Be
creative. Be&nbsp;heard.</p>

<p>But art is not just something we invite students to do. At the recent
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>, Jon Spooner, director of Human
Space Flight Operations at the <a href="http://unsa.org.uk/">Unlimited Space Agency</a>, attempted to
hack his way into space using a secret launch point alleged to be hidden
somewhere in the <span class="caps">UK</span> Met Office. Read <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/blog/2012/04/22/launchjon-unlimited-space-agency-hacking-space/">here</a> for the real story of
Jon&#8217;s mission and how theater and creative engagement are opening doors
to talk about space science and <span class="caps">STEM</span> in the <span class="caps">UK</span> - and all over the world.
He tells part of his story&nbsp;here:</p>

<p><strong>Other thoughts on the intersection of scientists and art&#8230; or
artists and&nbsp;science:</strong></p>
<p><em>Science communication is not a one-way street between researchers <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
journalists to the lay public. From the Science Art Feed you can see the
array of conversations non-scientists are starting through visual media.
There’s a response, an echo and an amplification to the impact the
scientific method has had on culture. Researchers, too, are stepping in
and showing the inspiring, baffling and illuminating images they come
across and use. Does it mean there is a new aesthetic, a new movement
afoot?</em><br />
[Glendon Mellow in Scientific&nbsp;American ][]</p>
<p><em>&#8230;art is not only close to science but it is complementary, and even
necessary. Thus the scientific eye is able to penetrate the smallest
sub-atomic particle, which moves perpetually creating energy waves and
makes one realise that the structure of matter consists of emptiness.
The artistic eye can see in that void, in that fluid &#8220;emptiness&#8221;, a seed
for a new vision of the world: a world no longer dominated by
materialism and its devastating consequences.</em><br />
[Liz Else in New&nbsp;Scientist ][]</p>
<p>Art remains an invaluable tool not just for outreach but for how we talk
about science and exploration. Alan Alda gave this interesting lecture
at Stony Brook on training scientists to talk about their work and
communicate&nbsp;differently:</p>

for Communicating&nbsp;Science</strong>  </p>

<p>Finally, John Bohannon and the Black Label Movement gave this incredibly
powerful TEDx Brussels talk called Dance your PhD, reflecting on how
sometimes dance could communicate more than science - or words - ever
could on their own. Human movement can communicate incredibly complex
ideas, expressing facets of the unknown in new and powerful&nbsp;ways.</p>

<p><strong>Where and how do you think art can help shape exploration? How could
art help <span class="caps">NASA</span> continue to tell its story of pioneering the&nbsp;future?</strong></p>
