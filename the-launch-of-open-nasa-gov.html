						<p>We are very excited to launch open.nasa.gov - a collaborative platform
for the open government community to share success stories and projects
they are working on.  The content on this site is written by <span class="caps">NASA</span>
employees and contractors.  We are excited to highlight the ways that
transparency, participation, and collaboration are being embraced by
<span class="caps">NASA</span> policy, technology, and culture – and the amazing future that
becomes possible because of that&nbsp;commitment.</p>
<p><strong>Tell me about the Open Government&nbsp;Plan!</strong></p>
<p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (<span class="caps">NASA</span>) released its
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html">Open Government Plan</a> on April 7th, 2010.  In December 2009, the
White House issued the Open Government Directive calling on Executive
Branch agencies to become more open and accountable. The Directive is
centered on the principles of transparency, collaboration, and
participation.  For more than 50 years, <span class="caps">NASA</span> has developed and nurtured
a rich culture of openness, fostering collaboration among scientists and
sharing the excitement surrounding scientific discoveries, aeronautics,
and space with the public at large.  <span class="caps">NASA</span> is striving to incorporate
open government into every facet of its mission, from developing an open
source software cloud computing platform to creating new incentivized
challenges for talented and interested members of the public, following
the five <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government&nbsp;principles.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government plan continues to create a new level of
openness and accountability in our policies, technology, and culture. As
the plan evolves over time <span class="caps">NASA</span> will continue to see success in these
areas and work to replicate it throughout the Agency.  Over the past
year, <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Open Government Plan was highly rated by the Administration
and the watchdog group, <em>openthegovernment.org.</em> <span class="caps">NASA</span> was also among a
few agencies recognized with two &#8220;Leading Practices&#8221; Awards from the
White House, for achievement above and beyond the requirements of the
Open Government Directive in the categories of “Participation and
Collaboration” and “Flagship Initiatives.”  <span class="caps">NASA</span> is proud of our
achievements and looks forward to continuing to establish a solid
foundation for institutional change based on the five <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open
Government&nbsp;principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external&nbsp;stakeholders.</li>
<li>Enable citizen participation in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;mission.</li>
<li>Improve internal <span class="caps">NASA</span> collaboration and&nbsp;innovation.</li>
<li>Encourage partnerships and create economic&nbsp;opportunity.</li>
<li>Institutionalize Open Government philosophies and practices at <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Can you give me an example of OpenGov at work at <span class="caps">NASA</span>?</strong></p>
<p>One example of <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s commitment to Open Government is in the area of
scientific and technical information. In accordance with the <em>National
Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958’s</em> commitment to “<em>provide for the
widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information
concerning its activities and the results thereof</em>,” the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Technical
Reports Server provides the public access to <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s current and
historical technical literature and engineering results. Over 500,000
aerospace-related citations, over 200,000 full-text online documents,
and over 500,000 images and videos, all created or funded by <span class="caps">NASA</span>, are
publicly available. A common portal enables search and retrieval through
three primary multimedia collections that span <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s history. An
upgraded public interface was rolled out this year, which includes
algorithmic search assistance, search refinement and concept clouds,
opening up amazing artifacts of space history and enabling true
knowledge&nbsp;discovery.</p>
