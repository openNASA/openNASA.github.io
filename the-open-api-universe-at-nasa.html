						<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> has a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of interesting data. <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s commitment to open data
expands the audience for the vast body of knowledge captured in nearly
100 years of <span class="caps">U.S.</span> aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and many others can contribute
directly to the exploration of space and Earth by helping to create new
ways of looking at this data. Additionally, the release of
administrative and procedural information from within <span class="caps">NASA</span> enables
researchers and analysts to understand more about the inner workings of
<span class="caps">NASA</span> as well as allow our own employees to better understand other
functions of our Agency. We are continually working to improve
accessibility to this data and incentivizing the use of government data
by citizens. One way that <span class="caps">NASA</span> data can be made more available online is
through an “<em>application programming interface</em>” or <span class="caps">API</span>. While the name
may be intimidating, you probably use APIs every day. APIs bring us
real-time news, weather, and photosharing. APIs feed the content to many
of your favorite website or mobile applications. In the past few years,
APIs have experienced an exponential increase in popularity and&nbsp;usage.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> General Services Administration&#8217;s DigitalGov
University hosted a webinar titled &#8220;Case Studies from the Federal
Register, <span class="caps">NASA</span>, and <span class="caps">GSA</span>&#8221; with the purpose of discussing the use of <span class="caps">API</span>&#8217;s
in government. Below is the short presentation based on some examples
from <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<p>
<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="505a1865f4e6ad000200211d" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
</p>

<p><strong>What is an <span class="caps">API</span>?</strong></p>
<p>An <span class="caps">API</span>, or “<em>Application Program Interface</em>”, is a set of routines and
protocols that provide building blocks for computer programmers and
application developers to build software applications. In its simplest
form, an <span class="caps">API</span> makes raw data accessible in a machine readable format so
you can create any application you can dream of. In the past, APIs were
largely associated with computer operating systems and desktop
applications. In recent years though, we have seen the emergence of Web
APIs (Web&nbsp;Services).</p>
<p><strong>What is <span class="caps">NASA</span> doing in regards to&nbsp;APIs?</strong></p>
<p>For <span class="caps">NASA</span>, data is at the heart of what we do but <span class="caps">NASA</span> is really just
getting started in it&#8217;s mission to expand the <span class="caps">API</span> universe. We recognize
that there is a need to organize and make sense of the ever-increasing
amount of tools and data catalogs that are publicly available on <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s
many websites, and so we created a directory that lists the publicly
available datasets and serves to streamline the process for posting
these datasets on data.gov. The directory includes information and
direct links to hundreds of datasets. In August 2011, we launched a data
<span class="caps">API</span> around the online archive of <span class="caps">NASA</span> data sets. The <a href="http://www.data.nasa.gov">data.nasa.gov</a>
<span class="caps">API</span> provides a RESTful interface, with responses in <span class="caps">JSON</span> for the <span class="caps">NASA</span>
data&nbsp;archives.</p>
<p><em>But this is just the&nbsp;beginning.</em></p>
<p><strong>A Wide Open&nbsp;Field</strong></p>
<p>There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. We have a lot of
work to do to build more meaningful, focused APIs that deliver the many
kinds of data we produce, and we would love your help! There is a huge
opportunity for anyone with interest to help <span class="caps">NASA</span> make its data more
accessible and derive new meaning from existing datasets through APIs.
Whatever you can dream of doing with this public data, it’s yours to
use, and we encourage you to get&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>As part of <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s response to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>, we
are charged with creating at least two new APIs in the coming year. We
would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on what data you would like
us to focus on. We also hope to create more opportunities for <span class="caps">YOU</span> to get
directly involved. We&#8217;ll be offering a few new <span class="caps">API</span> related challenges at
upcoming mass collaboration events this next year, including <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random
Hacks of Kindness</a> or the second <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps
Challenge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdsourcing <span class="caps">API</span>&nbsp;Development</strong></p>
<p>The idea of developing an <span class="caps">API</span> to access an already complicated data set
or service may sound overwhelming. The good news is that the most
creative work often comes from outside the walls of government. Living
in the information age has its benefits and one of them is that there
are thousands of people around the world who can help you. In April, we
issued a few <span class="caps">API</span> related challenges at the International Space Apps
Challenge and the results were impressive. A virtual team of three
developers created <a href="http://exoapi.com/">ExoAPI</a> - a powerful tool that provides access to
exoplanet data through a simple RESTful <span class="caps">API</span>. The video below is not only
inspirational, but serves as an example of what can happen when we
engage citizens in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;mission.</p>
