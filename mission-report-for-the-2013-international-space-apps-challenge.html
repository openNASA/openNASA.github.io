						<p>The International Space Apps Challenge is a two-day hackathon where
teams of technologists, scientists, designers, artists, educators,
entrepreneurs, developers, and students collaborate across the globe,
using publicly available data to design innovative solutions for global
challenges in software development, citizen science, hardware, and data
visualization. For the 2013 event, more than 9,000 global citizens in 44
countries and 83 cities engaged directly with <span class="caps">NASA</span> for the largest
hackathon in history. In just 83 total hours they collectively developed
awe-inspiring software, built jaw-dropping hardware, and created
stunning data visualizations that collectively went a long way to
improving life on Earth and in space. The results? An unbelievable 770
solutions were submitted, thousands of people worked together to address
challenges, and an immeasurable amount of enthusiasm and investment in
exploration was&nbsp;created&#8230;</p>
<p>Ultimately, the International Space Apps Challenge represents our latest
efforts in working together – with <span class="caps">YOU</span> – to enable us all to reach for
new heights and reveal the unknown. The first and second annual events
have been an experiment within government to adapt to the changing
external environment, embrace new technologies, engage with our
citizens, and encourage collaborations and partnerships. This is the
result of the government recognizing that we can be more relevant for
our stakeholders and intentionally create a culture of openness as we
attempt to evolve into <em>a twenty-first century space program for a
twenty-first century&nbsp;democracy.</em></p>
