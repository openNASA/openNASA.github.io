						<p><em>What exactly is a space app? What could you do with all that data,
anyway? And how can we use space to improve life on&nbsp;Earth? </em></p>
<p>On the first night of the first codeathon-type event I ever attended, I
saw this quote from Herb Kelleher posted on the wall: “We have a
strategic plan, it’s called <span class="caps">DOING</span> <span class="caps">THINGS</span>.” And that’s the key to what’s
going to happen at the Apps Challenge: we’re in this to <strong>do things</strong>.
We’re in this to <strong>make things</strong>. We’re in this because we believe that
the questions that motivate us to explore space can change the way we
live here on Earth and the way the next generation will continue to
explore, and we’re ready to see where that takes&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>To stir up your imagination, the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">Apps Challenge</a> team has assembled
this list of some of the coolest apps we have seen recently using space
data, space experience, or just plain space <strong>awesomeness</strong>. They
include software and hardware, science and art, education outreach and
creative ideation. Some of these apps originated as official <span class="caps">NASA</span>
projects; some are the work of engaged, inspired citizens. Nearly all
demonstrate the vital importance of <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/30/introducing-data-nasa-gov/">open data</a> and the scientific and
technological possibilities it&nbsp;creates.</p>
<p>You can read more <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/blog/2012/03/01/software-hardware-data-visualization-and-citizen-s/">here</a> about the four types of challenges we will
address at the event. We&#8217;re adding new challenges to the site every few
days&#8230; go <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">here</a> to read and comment on the current challenges, and
go <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/submit/">here</a> to submit a new challenge idea for the International Space
Apps&nbsp;Challenge.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/13/space-ipsum/">Space Ipsum Generator</a> (</strong>created by Sean Herron, Nick Skytland,
and William&nbsp;Eshagh)</p>
<p><em>software/ open data&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>Lorem Ipsum is the standard filler text used in design throughout the
world. It’s been the standards since the 1500’s and it’s time for an
update. The <span class="caps">NASA</span> OpenGov team took the opportunity at Science Hack Day
to create a new online tool to generate filler text based on a database
of historical space quotes. The project serves as an example of what can
be done to utilize historic <span class="caps">NASA</span> data and mash it up in a new and
exciting way. Although a “lorem ipsum” generator may seem
inconsequential at first glance, the weekend project will serve as the
backbone to a future data mashup project for the <span class="caps">NASA</span> OpenGov&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>The Space Ipsum site also perhaps <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s first experiment in responsive
design – the idea the content should not dictate the look and feel of
the site.  No matter what type of platform you view the website on,
you’ll always be able to access it’s core features due to the use of
<span class="caps">CSS3</span> media queries. This is an evolution in web design and represents
the future of how web design should act.  The site also features some of
<span class="caps">NASA</span>’s historic space images that load as the background randomly when a
user visits the site.  We’ve put the code on <a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Space-Ipsum">github</a> and encourage
others to use it for their&nbsp;purposes.</p>

<p><em>citizen science/open data&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>Galaxy Zoo: Hubble uses gorgeous imagery of hundreds of thousands of
galaxies drawn from <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Hubble Space Telescope archive. To understand
how these galaxies, and our own, formed we need your help to classify
them according to their shapes — a task at which your brain is better
than even the most advanced computer. If you&#8217;re quick, you may even be
the first person in history to see each of the galaxies you&#8217;re asked to&nbsp;classify.</p>
<p>More than 250,000 people have taken part in Galaxy Zoo so far, producing
a wealth of valuable data and sending telescopes on Earth and in space
chasing after their discoveries. The images used in Galaxy Zoo: Hubble
are more detailed and beautiful than ever, and will allow us to look
deeper into the Universe than ever before. To begin exploring, click the
&#8216;How To Take Part&#8217; link above, or read <a href="http://www.galaxyzoo.org/story">The Story So Far</a> to find out
what Galaxy Zoo has achieved to&nbsp;date.</p>
<p><strong><a href="youtube.com/user/spacelab">YouTube Spacelab</a></strong>(created by YouTube in partnership with <span class="caps">NASA</span> and
many other&nbsp;organizations)</p>
<p><em>ideation/ citizen science/ creative visualization&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>YouTube Space Lab is an amazing competition and a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity which you could be a part of. All you have to do is come up
with an idea. It should be fun and you might learn some interesting
stuff about space in the process. If that&#8217;s not enough, we&#8217;re giving you
the chance to win some great prizes. From all the submissions we get,
one winning team (or individual if you enter alone) will be chosen in
each region of the world (The Americas; Europe, Middle-East and Africa;
Asia-Pacific) from each of the two age categories (14 - 16, 17 - 18),
making six regional winners overall. The regional winners will win a
free trip to Washington, <span class="caps">D.C.</span> <span class="caps">USA</span> for a special event in March 2012,
where they&#8217;ll also get to take an exhilarating zero-G flight, which lets
you experience weightlessness, and they&#8217;ll each receive Lenovo IdeaPads.
At the special event, two of the regional winners will be selected as
global winners. The global winners&#8217; experiments will be performed by
astronauts aboard the International Space Station and they&#8217;ll win a
amazing once-in-a-lifetime space experience of their&nbsp;choice.</p>

<p><strong> <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/12/01/spacelab-for-ios/">SpaceLab for <span class="caps">IOS</span></a></strong>(created by <a href="http://www.odysseysr.com/">Odyssey Space Research</a>)</p>
<p><em>open software/ citizen science&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>The purpose of <em>SpaceLab for iOS</em> is to demonstrate that an inexpensive
consumer electronics device can perform tasks previously reserved for
expensive single purpose devices.  Modern smart phones contain hardware
once only found in expensive avionics.  Where an avionics box may have
had a limited production run of 100′s or 1000′s of devices, a smart
phone may have a similar engineer investment but a longer production run
of millions, which significantly lowers the cost for users of the
device.  The goal of this project is to significantly lower the cost of
space flight and lower the barrier to access in&nbsp;space.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/real-time-climate-data-comparison-platform-second-challenge">Real-time Climate Data Comparison Platform</a></strong>(written by World Bank
and worked on at <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">RHoK</a>)</p>
<p><em>software/ open data/ social good&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>In the absence of weather station data, Meteorological Satellite
Information (<span class="caps">MSI</span>) is crucial to estimating local climate.  <span class="caps">MSI</span> is
used worldwide to understand climate change effects, formulating
strategies for disaster risk management, and analyzing the gap between
water supply and demand. This knowledge, especially precipitation
behavior – main supplier of water - allows countries to promote
effective planning for fighting poverty. However, while <span class="caps">MSI</span> can estimate
climate where there aren&#8217;t any weather station, the accuracy of <span class="caps">MSI</span>
depends heavily on field data (weather stations on the ground) to
calibrate outputs. Therefore, there is a contradiction here: if <span class="caps">MSI</span>
requires field data for accuracy, how can <span class="caps">MSI</span> be useful in places where
no weather station data is available? The first challenge is to bring
together satellite and ground information for users in real time and
create a tool which will produce a geospatial representation of both
sources of information. The first challenge was already accomplished
during the RhoK in Philadelphia. The second challenge is to generate an
&#8220;averaged&#8221; geospatial map from the combination of <span class="caps">MSI</span> and the ground&nbsp;data.</p>

Center and&nbsp;Google)</p>
<p><em>open hardware/physical&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>Not content just to have iPhones on the Station, Android phones had to
join the fun too. The NexusOne PhoneSat project aims to determine if
low-cost mobile phone components can withstand space travel. The phones
must withstand extreme vibrations on the way to reaching orbit, function
properly in a vacuum and operate at both extremely high and low
temperatures. Go <a href="http://gov20.govfresh.com/nasa-to-launch-inexpensive-android-phonesats-into-space/">here</a> to read more about the&nbsp;collaboration.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">NASA</span> Project <span class="caps">KEWL</span> (Kinect Engineering With Learning)</strong>(created at
the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Johnson Space Center</a>)</p>
<p><em>software/ creative visualization/ education&nbsp;app</em></p>
<p>Project <span class="caps">KEWL</span> is a joint project between <span class="caps">NASA</span>/<span class="caps">JPL</span> and <span class="caps">NASA</span>/<span class="caps">JSC</span> to
stimulate interest of children in Science, Technology, Engineering and
Math (<span class="caps">STEM</span>) and bring the <span class="caps">NASA</span> space exploration experience to the
classroom, museum and ultimately the living room. Using the Kinect game
controller <span class="caps">KEWL</span> allows children to engage in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s missions in a
fundamentally new way. <span class="caps">KEWL</span> allows children to experiment with gravity
on Mars and the Moon; navigate through the International Space Station;
fix a torn solar array on the <span class="caps">ISS</span>; drive a robot on Mars; visit an
Asteroid; learn about the differences in gravity on different planets
and control Robonaut 2 using their body as the input&nbsp;device.</p>
<p>Project <span class="caps">KEWL</span> complements <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s outreach investments in television,
mobile platforms and the web by engaging the public through the rapidly
expanding medium of console gaming. In 2008, [97% of teenagers played
video games and 86% played on a home gaming console][]. As of March
2011, there have been <a href="http://www.itproportal.com/2011/03/10/ki%20nect-record-brea%20king-sales-figu%20res-top-10-million/">more than 10 million Kinects sold</a>. Project
<span class="caps">KEWL</span> interacts with children on a platform on which they spend much of
their time and teaches them information about <span class="caps">NASA</span> while they are having&nbsp;fun.</p>
<p>Project <span class="caps">KEWL</span> progressed from completely custom C++ code written in house
to using a commercial game engine. The art work and 3D geometry models
come from existing engineering work or are created by the <span class="caps">KEWL</span>
development team. Six different <span class="caps">KEWL</span> applications have been demonstrated
at nine different venues including schools, museums, conferences, and
<span class="caps">NASA</span> outreach events . These demonstrations have allowed the developers
the chance to interact with players and observe the gameplay mechanics
in action . The lessons learned were then incorporated into the
subsequent versions of the&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>Do you know of other great space apps? Please leave us a comment and
tell us about them so we can use them to inspire great, diverse
development at International Space Apps&nbsp;Challenge!</p>
