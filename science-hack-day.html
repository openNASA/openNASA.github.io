						<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s OpenGov Office supported and actively participated at November’s
Science Hack Day in Palo Alto, <span class="caps">CA</span>, where scientists, engineers,
developers, and designers came together to complete a variety of
projects, ranging from a Android phone controlled rover to an <span class="caps">GPS</span>
carrying balloon that could be used to quickly map a wide area. Through
their involvement, the <span class="caps">NASA</span> team gained valuable feedback on how to best
interact with Citizen Scientists to provide them with the tools and data
they need to&nbsp;succeed.</p>
<p>The team is now planning a similar event to hold in Texas later this
year. The event will be coordinated with Space Life Sciences and is
meant to engage “makers” - an emerging class of hackers who blur the
line between raw science data and the physical world with an interest in
bringing science and technology together.  Scientists, engineers,
developers and designers will be invited and encouraged to join teams to
develop, solder, construct, assemble and present projects related to
life sciences and <span class="caps">NASA</span> data.  The event will provide the <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Open
Government team another opportunity to make <span class="caps">NASA</span> data more available and&nbsp;accessible.</p>
