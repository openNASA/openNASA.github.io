						<p><strong><em>It seemed to be good to be true.</em></strong> Last fall, my friend and OpenGov
colleague Ali Llewellyn shared with me that there was a group of <span class="caps">NASA</span>
employees and contractors supporting an initiative to connect satellite
resources to better the world. I had to know&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>A simple Google search uncovered a webpage for the project, known as
<a href="http://servirglobal.net/"><span class="caps">SERVIR</span></a> or, to serve, in Spanish. Here, I learned that the <span class="caps">SERVIR</span>
initiative integrates satellite observations, ground-based data and
forecast models to monitor and forecast environmental changes and to
improve response to natural disasters. This enables scientists,
educators, project managers and policy implementers to better respond to
a range of issues including disaster management, agricultural
development, biodiversity conservation and climate change. Principally
supported by <span class="caps">NASA</span> and the <a href="http://usaid.gov/"><span class="caps">US</span> Agency of International Development</a>, or
<span class="caps">USAID</span>, a strong emphasis is placed on partnerships to fortify the
availability of searchable and viewable earth observations,
measurements, animations, and&nbsp;analysis.</p>
<p><strong><em>Impressive, yes, but how do they do it and who are the people
involved?</em></strong>This question and others I pondered as I drove to the <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama to see the
<a href="http://servirglobal.net/"><span class="caps">SERVIR</span></a> coordination office and rapid prototyping facility&nbsp;firsthand.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, I was warmly greeted by the project director Dan Irwin, an
energetic and articulate man who has committed his career to serving his
passion for both those in need and leveraging the multitude of resources
<span class="caps">NASA</span> generates in our quest to uncover the unknown. Over the next hour I
had the honor of meeting his diverse team as they highlighted current
projects and past accomplishments which had caught the attention and
support of not only the head of <span class="caps">NASA</span>, but the <span class="caps">US</span> president and multiple
dignitaries on numerous&nbsp;occasions.</p>
<p>Spanning three continents, several countries, and affecting thousands of
lives, <a href="http://servirglobal.net/"><span class="caps">SERVIR</span>’s</a> reach is extensive and a result of
well-conceived, sustainable efforts. Their latest project, <span class="caps">ISERV</span>: The
<span class="caps">ISS</span> / <span class="caps">SERVIR</span> Environmental Research and Visualization System promises to
be yet another win for social&nbsp;good.</p>
<p>This tool, scheduled to launch to the international space station on
June 26th, is dedicated to assisting social innovators and emergency
responders to accessing much needed data and imagery within 3 hours of a
web or mobile app request. The <span class="caps">ISERV</span> <em>Pathfinder</em>is the first phase in
an envisioned series of Earth observing instruments designed to leverage
the unique attributes of the International Space Station in order to
provide high quality data for science and disaster response at
relatively low&nbsp;cost.</p>
<p><em>Pathfinder</em>is a telescope that is ground commanded for pointing and
image acquisition. Individual commands or command scripts are uplinked
to the <span class="caps">ISERV</span> computer where they are executed at scheduled times. Data
frames are immediately stored aboard the <span class="caps">ISERV</span> computer, downlinked to
ground stations, and finally transmitted via Internet to the <span class="caps">ISERV</span>
Science Operations Center at <span class="caps">MSFC</span>’s National Space Science and
Technology Center (<span class="caps">NSSTC</span>) who then pushes it to the requester. When
complete, the <span class="caps">ISERV</span> suite could also include internal and external
optical sensors operating in the visible, near- and mid-<span class="caps">IR</span> portions of
the electromagnetic&nbsp;spectrum.</p>
<p><img alt="worf" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/worf-300x297.png" title="worf" /></p>
<p>This effort was accomplished by a dynamic team of less than 20
individuals that comprise the Coordination Office, many of whom have
personally founded nonprofits and spent time living and working in the
regions they serve. Their offices are strategically located outside of
the Marshall campus, thus allowing the group to receive employees,
intern and volunteer support from individuals around the world who can
offer relevant local&nbsp;perspectives.</p>
<p>Two <a href="http://servirglobal.net/"><span class="caps">SERVIR</span></a> project regional operational facilities support the
Coordination Office in 1) Nairobi, Kenya, at the Regional Center for
Mapping of Resources for Development (<span class="caps">RCMRD</span>) and 2) Kathmandu, Nepal, at
the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development. A third
hub, located at the Water Center for the Humid Tropics of Latin America
and the Caribbean (<span class="caps">CATHALAC</span>) in Panama City, Panama, recently
“graduated” from the <span class="caps">SERVIR</span> system and is providing information on its
own. Each <span class="caps">SERVIR</span> facility is housed in an existing organization with a
regional mandate, and the project is primarily staffed and operated by
people from that region. Together, the <span class="caps">SERVIR</span> facilities form a broader
<span class="caps">SERVIR</span> network with exchange of data, knowledge, and experience among
the centers that transcends geographic and organizational&nbsp;boundaries.</p>
<p><strong><em>Connect with <span class="caps">SERVIR</span></em></strong></p>
<p>While <a href="http://servirglobal.net/"><span class="caps">SERVIR</span></a> boasts multiple successes, the group seeks to expand.
Building and relying upon a network of collaborators is fundamental to
<span class="caps">SERVIR</span>. Beyond the sponsorship and active participation of <span class="caps">NASA</span> and
<span class="caps">USAID</span>, collaboration spans a number of other <span class="caps">US</span> government agencies and
projects, as well as partnerships with government agencies in the
regions in which <span class="caps">SERVIR</span> operates joint research with universities and
non-governmental organizations, and capacity building with a host of
specialized groups. <span class="caps">SERVIR</span> puts special emphasis on working with
national space agencies to improve the discovery and use of available
imagery. Collaboration also includes interaction with institutions that
play important roles in relevant global research and operational
activities (e.g., <span class="caps">GEO</span>, <span class="caps">UN</span>-<span class="caps">SPIDER</span>, International Charter, <span class="caps">CIESIN</span>, and
<span class="caps">IRI</span>). Operational and implementation partnerships, too, are critical and
have been established with <span class="caps">SERVIR</span>&#8217;s regional centers (e.g., <span class="caps">RCMRD</span> and
<span class="caps">ICIMOD</span>) to deliver products and services and improve outreach to
different thematic&nbsp;communities</p>
<p>In the future, <a href="http://servirglobal.net/"><span class="caps">SERVIR</span></a> plans to augment data sets, collaborations,
and opportunities receive requests and observations. We invite you to
learn more about <span class="caps">SERVIR</span>, including opportunities to see the lab in
action, request information, download data, collaborate, or to intern as
a student researcher at: <a href="http://servirglobal.net/">http://www.servirglobal.net/</a>.</p>
