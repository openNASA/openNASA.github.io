Do you want to go Mars but don't know when to leave or how much to
bring?  Do you want to study Earth protection by planning a mission to a
near-Earth asteroid?  Do you want to place a telescope in an orbit that
is always looking outwards from the Earth and Sun?  The General Mission
Analysis Tool (GMAT) is an open-source space mission design tool to help
you answer these and many other space flight challenges.  GMAT is
developed by a team of NASA, private industry, and public and private
contributors.  It is used for real-world engineering studies, as a tool
for education and public engagement, and (after completion of final
acceptance testing in Sept. 2013) to fly operational spacecraft.  In
addition,  we are proud to announce a formal partnership between NASA
and the Korean Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) to co-develop GMAT.
You can download GMAT here: `Windows Installer`_, `Source Code`_.

GMAT R2013a is the first official, production-quality release of GMAT.
 It is rigorously tested with nearly 11000 automated scripts tests
executed nightly and over 2400 automated GUI tests executed weekly.
  GMAT has already been used to support the LCROSS (Lunar Crater
Observation and Sensing Satellite), ARTEMIS (Acceleration, Reconnection,
Turbulence and Electrodynamics of the Moon’s Interaction with the Sun) ,
 LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter),  MMS (Magnetospheric Multiscale
Mission),  and OSIRIS-REx (Origins Spectral Interpretation Resource
Identification Security Regolith Explorer) missions and numerous mission
concepts.

Here are a few of the changes and improvements in R2013a:

-   580 pages of quality end user documentation in `html`_  and `PDF`_
   formats
-  Over 600 `bug fixes`_
-  GMAT is now licensed using the `Apache License, Version 2.0`_
