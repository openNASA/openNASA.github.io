*Noting today some new and interesting NASA-related social media efforts
across the web:*

**Meteor Counter application on iTunes**  

<http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/13dec_meteorcounter/>

You can help NASA astronomers! The Meteor Counter harnesses the power of
citizen scientists to document meteor observations – right from their
iPhone. Using an intuitive interface to document time, magnitude, and
location, all kinds of observers can contribute easily to science
efforts as NASA works to map meteoroids all around Earth’s orbit.

**NASA Goddard Space Flight Center on Instagram**

NASA Goddard Space Flight Center has built a following on a less
traditional social media platform: Instagram! The Goddard team is using
one of NASA’s most breathtaking resources – our imagery – to connect
directly with the public. Visually interesting images from inside their
Center to far across the universe get people engaged in NASA’s mission.

**NASA Sounds: Third Rock Radio and Ringtones**

NASA released a collection of NASA sounds from historic spaceflights and
current missions in both MP3 and M4R (iPhone) sound files to download.
You can hear the roar of a space shuttle launch or Neil Armstrong’s “One
small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind” every time you get a
phone call. On Third Rock Radio, NASA’s mission of discovery and
exploration is being showcased in a custom-produced Internet music radio
station that is crafted specifically to speak the language of tech-savvy
young adults.

**NEEMO 15 on Zooniverse**  
<http://neemo.zooniverse.org/>

We have seen how crowd-sourcing open space data can discover new
galaxies, planets, and even make a detailed map of the Moon. In
partnership with Zooniverse Labs and the [NEEMO-15][] underwater analog
mission, NASA is looking at technologies that will let the power of our
interconnectedness drive discovery. Using a new platform which takes a
square kilometer of ocean-bottom imagery and parses it out into an
easily navigable, compelling user interface, NASA invites the public to
help find scientifically relevant items, in order to allow us to outline
them for a broad representation of the reef. Traverse planning
scientists use this aggegated data to target, or confirm the interest
items for further study.

**Space Race Blastoff on Facebook**  
<http://apps.facebook.com/spacerace>

NASA’s first multi-player Facebook game tests players' knowledge of
space history, technology, science and pop culture. Players who
correctly answer questions earn virtual badges depicting NASA
astronauts, spacecraft and celestial objects. Players also earn points
they can use to obtain additional badges to complete sets and earn
premium badges. Come and join the fun!

*Where have you seen NASA do something unique and awesome online
recently? Let us know so we can add it to the list!*
