**We have 133 projects qualified for global judging... and we're excited
to see which one is the People's Choice!**

Voting for the People's Choice award starts tomorrow! You'll go to the
[Awards page][] and click on the Vote button next to your favorite
project. Anyone and everyone is eligible to vote for the project they
consider most deserving of the title People's Choice.

We are using Twitter to collect votes and have assigned a unique hashtag
to each project. Individuals simply need to tweet @spaceapps with the
hashtag of their favorite project to vote. This hashtag is not
alterable, so please be sure that you are sharing the correct one so
that we can track your support online.

**If you have a Twitter account:** everything should work from the
website as long as you are also signed in to your Twitter account.

**If you do not have a Twitter account:** no problem! Go [here][] to
create an account. Once you have an account and are signed in, go back
to the [Awards page][] and select the project you would like to vote
for.

Please help spread the word about your favorite projects! Voting is only
open until May 17th. We want to hear what \#SpaceApps project you
believe deserves a special award.

The global judging panel is reviewing the 133 nominated projects to
award Best Use of Data, Best Use of Hardware, Galactic Impact and Most
Inspiring. These best-in-class awards will be announced on **May 22**
along with the People's Choice winner. Want further details on the
