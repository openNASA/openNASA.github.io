Join leaders form NASA, other federal agencies, industry and academia to
talk about the latest trends, research and best practices in the IT
landscape at the NASA IT Summit in San Francisco. We teamed up with the
Open Forum Foundation to provide online access to a portion of the full
roster of innovative speakers, leaders, and trendsetters from where you
are right now! You are able to view all keynotes and featured speakers
(over 25% of the event!) through LiveStream sessions that also include
the ability to interact with other remote participants and propose
questions for the speakers (if there's Q/A time). In addition, you are
able to engage in LiveCall small group discussions with select speakers
outside of the normal Summit schedule. These sessions will be via
conference call as well as online chat and discussion forums. We hope
you will join us!
