`NASA Chief Scientist Waleed Abdalati`_ reminded me so eloquently
yesterday about what is so powerful about what we do here at NASA.

    The iconic success of NASA is planted firmly on three foundational
    elements: innovation, inspiration, and integrity. While innovation
    and inspiration are visible through our endeavors and successes, *it
    is our integrity – how we work, and our commitment to excellence and
    openness – that earns us the trust of the public and ensures our
    continued ability to inspire and innovate.*  Integrity is woven
    throughout the fabric of NASA.  It has always been there. And each
    and every day, we recommit ourselves to keeping it there.

(You can read more about the Agency's framework for scientific
integrity \ `here`_.)

**Innovation** is what NASA is known for. Every day we are asking new
questions and solving problems in new ways. We are `encouraging
innovation internally`_ and building `innovative communities
externally`_, incubating technologies that are \ `deeply committed to
making a better world`_. We are developing `innovative partnerships`_
all the time to encourage cross-pollination of research and ideas.

Almost all of us have wondered about life beyond Earth or dreamt of
flying in space at some point in our lives;\ **inspiration** is the part
that seems to come so easily. Who isn't inspired by `this`_? Or

Or

NASA gives us `perspective on our planet`_ - and on `what it means to be
human`_ - every single day. Every time I watch brave explorers suit up
and climb onto a rocket to go to space, like I did `just this week`_, I
get excited again about what is and can be possible.

**Integrity**, however, is the commitment we make every single day.
Integrity is doing the hard work of putting things into the light -
documenting ideas, insuring safety, working through processes, truly
engaging citizens. It's what allows crewmembers to `"strap themselves to
a few million pounds of explosives and trusting that everything will
work as planned."`_ Sometimes it means `asking hard questions about our
own issues`_. Integrity is insuring that not just the crew but the
*public* can trust what is behind the decisions we are making - and
committing to appropriately share that information with them. The
`National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958`_, as amended, stipulates
that NASA shall “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof.” And as the policy notes: *unless a determination is made that
public dissemination of  information must be prohibited or restricted,
NASA information is made available to the public*. (\ `NPR 2200.2,
Section 4.5.1`_)

I fully believe that this is why `openness`_ is so important at NASA as
we stay focused on such an important `mission`_. As Dr. Abdalati notes,
our "awareness of the freedoms and responsibilities [that integrity
requires] will help us continue to pursue new knowledge, fuel wonder,
and make groundbreaking discoveries about the universe and our place in
it." It is also why we continue to `engage citizens`_, pressing forward
with `open source policy development`_, building an effective `platform
for open data`_, accelerating `effective technologies`_, and
strengthening the `open communities`_ here across NASA.

It is a commitment that is often hard. *But it is one that is always
worthwhile.*
