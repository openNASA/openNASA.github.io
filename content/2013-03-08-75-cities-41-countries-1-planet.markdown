_What could be possible when citizens in 75 cities and 41 countries come together to work on more than 50 specially curated challenges?_ We will explore new ideas, perspectives and technologies. We will use data to build solutions to address real challenges. We will work together, harnessing the capacity and experience of a diverse group of global citizens to help make a better planet to live in on well as a better future for living off-planet. **All in 48 hours. **

Thanks to everyone who expressed interest in hosting and supporting the Space Apps Challenge. _Unfortunately we are not able to take any additional applications for this year_, but citizens everywhere are invited to [participate virtually](http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/virtual/) and work on the challenges either individually or with teams all over the world. [One of the best projects last year](http://vimeo.com/41634392) was produced by a virtual team!)
