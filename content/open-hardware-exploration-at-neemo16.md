In April, we had the chance to meet [Eric Stackpole][] and [David
Lang][] at the [International Space Apps Challenge][]. They had
submitted a challenged called “*[OpenROV Framework Development][]*” with
the goal to “*further the development of hardware, software, and
communications interfaces to visually and bathymetrically map the ocean
floor, in an opensource fashion*.” [OpenROV][] captured our interest,
not only because it was one of the top globally recognized solutions
submitted during the event, but because it’s exactly the open source,
observation-class ROV (remotely operated vehicle) we have been looking
for! *Let me explain.*

During last year’s NEEMO-15 mission, the NASA Open Government Initiative
built a software platform to engage citizen scientists in helping us
[crowdsource the analysis of the coral reef around the Aquarius
habitat][]. The effort was an overwhelming success. In just over a week,
over 300 citizen scientists discovered over 12,000 features, and
confirmed (or disputed) each others observations over 22,000 times.
Crowdsourcing techniques such as these are being considered in the
overall exploration approach, as NASA plans missions to distant worlds,
including asteroids.

The plans for [OpenROV][] couldn’t have fit more perfectly with our
hopes of [crowdsourcing science during the NEEMO mission][]. The goal of
the [OpenROV][] project has been to create an ROV that is low-cost and
able to be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts, but also capable of
doing scientific research. A secondary goal of the project has been to
cultivate a community of citizen science contributors to the design and
implementation of the ROV. The contributors consist of both professional
and amateur underwater robotics enthusiasts.

The promise of [OpenROV][] is that citizens around the world can create
their own open hardware and help us explore our world. This is why we
invited [Eric Stackpole][] and [David Lang][] to join [Chris Gerty][]
and I at the [NEEMO][] mission to see how we might combine the open
software and open hardware technology we have collectively developed. If
you aren’t familiar with [NEEMO][], it’s a NASA analog mission that
sends groups of astronauts, engineers and scientists to live in
Aquarius, the world's only undersea research station, for weeks at a
time. As [Brian McGlaughlin][] describes it, [NEEMO][] is "*an amazing
rapid prototyping environment that is like a Hackathon on the ocean
floor*." The Aquarius habitat and its surroundings provide a useful
analog for space exploration. The ocean floor is largely uncharted
terrain, has potential to be explored in great detail, and has the need
to send people to only the most interesting of locations - much the same
is true of our potential off-planet destinations.

The team’s focus during [NEEMO-16][NEEMO] was specifically to
demonstrate how open hardware can be used to take imagery of local
undersea environments, and then feed this data into applications that
visualize or crowdsource the analysis, in order that we might better
understand extreme environments. From a technical perspective, the test
evaluated the opportunity for incorporating open source hardware
technology into the program, learning both the benefits and challenges
of an open, distributed development network. The larger benefit of
incorporating [OpenROV][] is the potential for the engagement and
involvement of the general public. By using a low-cost, open source
product, NASA aims to involve public contributions to their missions as
well as inspire citizen scientists to experiment and explore in their
own backyards. Our objectives for the week were simply to:

-   Establish physical and software techniques to minimize effect of
    ocean currents and sea states on a lightweight ROV,
-   Develop techniques to generate a geotagged imagery dataset of the
    reef,
-   Demonstrate ability to provide real-time situational awareness to
    ongoing [NEEMO][] seafloor activities, and
-   Interface with other objectives of [NEEMO-16][NEEMO] and evaluate
    use of [OpenROV][] technology for future missions.

The [OpenROV][] performed spectacularly during the test and the
technology demonstration was a success, which enabled the team to
experiment a bit more using the platform. An undersea sensor package
used by science teams at NEEMO-16 was attached to the OpenROV and
evaluated. Also, images of Aquarius gathered by various underwater
[GoPro][] cameras were processed by [Autodesk’s 123D][] image software
to attempt a three-dimensional mapping of structure on the ocean floor.
 Thank you to [Eric Stackpole][] and [David Lang][] of [OpenROV][1] for
participating in the mission as well as [Brian McLaughlin][Brian
McGlaughlin] from the [Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS)][] project at
NASA Goddard for helping to share the story with his audience on
[Wired’s Geek Dad blog][].
