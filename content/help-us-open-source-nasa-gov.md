The use of open source software, cloud computing technologies, and an
integrated approach to search, video, and social media seems almost
common-place in industry these days. Yet government websites aren’t
quite there with the exception of [a few noteable exceptions][] (not an
exhaustive list by any means). This is why I’m so excited about that
[NASA has recently released an RFI][] (Request for Information) for
information on how to build a better public website nasa.gov and
intranet insdie.nasa.gov. This is *a really big step* for NASA, but,we
**truly** need your help.

**This is how it works.** NASA has released an RFI and draft statement
of work. An RFI, or request for information, is a standard government
acquisition process in which vendors submit information that is then
used for comparative purposes to help NASA later release an RFP, or
request for proposal. An RFI helps NASA

-   Conduct market research to identify what kinds of product or service
    solutions are commercially available
-   Ask industry to offer solutions for agency requirements or
    objectives
-   Collect information about relevant companies, their capabilities,
    products, and experience

nasa.gov is a very high profile website with more around 600,000 unique
visitors and 43 million “hits” per day. The architecture itself is
massive, with roughly 140 disparate websites and web applications and
more total 700,000 web pages across 10 centers. It’s no small job and we
need someone who can help usher us into the future and develop a web
architecture appropriate for an agency like NASA. This is one of the
greatest jobs on Earth and we are looking to you to help.

If you are interested in helping us, the first step is simple. [Respond
to the RFI][NASA has recently released an RFI]. We are looking for
companies and organizations that are visionary, that get open source,
cloud computing, and citizen engagement using the latest online
technology.

**Here’s the catch.** You don’t have much time to respond. RFI responses
must be submitted <span style="color: #ff0000;">**no later than 3:00
p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March 6, 2012**</span>! [For all the
details check out the announcement here][NASA has recently released an
RFI].  [Luke Fretwell][] at [FedScoop][] also wrote a good article
summarizing the highlights and includes an embed of the main documents.
