_We're excited to share this update from [Fragile Oasis](http://www.fragileoasis.org/), one of open.NASA's favorite communities. Fragile Oasis is NASA's grassroots initiative that connects the orbital perspective of astronauts who live and work in space with people who want to make a difference on Earth. _

Today, on the 44th anniversary of humanity's first steps on the Moon and the 3rd anniversary of the birth of [Fragile Oasis](http://www.fragileoasis.org/) as a platform for collaboration we are thrilled to announce that three Fragile Oasis community projects have earned the Fragile Oasis Prize Medal for making a positive impact in Education, Humanitarian Service and Peace.

Of the 120 projects submitted from all over the world, Fragile Oasis crewmembers selected [nine semi-finalists](http://www.fragileoasis.org/blog/2013/07/making-an-impact-the-fragile-oasis-prize-medal-nominees/) making a difference in Argentina, Canada, Rwanda, Somalia, Sudan, and in the United States. And then, over a 30-day period, crewmembers voted for one project in each category to receive a medal that flew with me for a half year on my last mission to the International Space Station.

The winners of the Fragile Oasis Prize Medal are:

[Free the Water:](http://www.fragileoasis.org/projects/free-the-water/) The brainchild of D.M.J. March, a young Canadian who works tenaciously to raise awareness about Earth’s water and how humanity uses this most precious resource.

[Convoy for Hope – Food for Famine Relief in Somalia:](http://www.fragileoasis.org/projects/convoy-for-hope/) An initiative of the Global Enrichment Foundation and an act of courage inspired by its founder, Amanda Lindhout.

[World’s Biggest Dream Board:](http://www.fragileoasis.org/projects/worlds-biggest-dream-board/) Juliette Wallen’s challenge to make the world a better place, born in one California town and now spreading all over in social media, the biggest small town of them all.

D.M.J., Amanda and Juliette will be joining me for a Google + hangout next week, where we will discuss their individual efforts and how people everywhere can work together to improve life on Earth.

I’m excited and honored to spend time with people who are working to make life on our Fragile Oasis as beautiful for all as it is visibly beautiful from space. The Key is WE!
