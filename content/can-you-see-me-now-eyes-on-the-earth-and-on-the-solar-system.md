Open Government at NASA is committed to making [data][] available and
enabling the public to engage that data. NASA’s [Jet Propulsion
Laboratory][] is using video game technology to immerse the general
public and mission personnel in the solar system and beyond. The
Visualization Technology Applications and Development Group is creating
3D environments full of real NASA mission data, permitting exploration
of the planet – and the cosmos.

“Eyes on the Earth” and “Eyes on the Solar System” are cross-platform,
real-time, 3D-interactive applications that run inside a Web browser.
Combining real-time spacecraft data and NASA imagery, the applications
give users a unique and extraordinary view of the solar system by
virtually transporting them across space and time to make first-person
observations of NASA spacecraft in action as they explore the planets,
moons, asteroids and comets. YOU can be an armchair astronaut and
explore what's happening all over earth and in space - real-time.

"Hundreds of gigabytes of spacecraft trajectory data, orbital
parameters, planetary maps and other fascinating resources are available
to the public via portals like the PDS, NAIF or HORIZONS. However,
difficulty in processing and interpreting the various formats of that
data put a barrier to access between it and the general public,” said
Doug Ellison, the team’s Visualization Producer.

“What we've done with Eyes on the Solar System is take that data, put it
all in context and wrap it in an experience that we think lets the
public enjoy it and use it with almost no pre-existing knowledge of what
that data is or how to make sense of it. It's the very same data that
the engineers use to navigate their spacecraft across the solar system.
By unlocking it with 'Eyes on the Solar System', we're letting the
public come along for the ride and that's a very powerful tool for both
education and engagement."

Ever wondered how many satellites are in orbit around the earth and how
they intersect? Where Voyager 2 looks like and what it’s seeing? What it
would look like to fly along real time with various satellites? What the
actual data is about global temperature, sea level, the ozone layer –
and what it means all put together? How the solar system is actually
moving in real time? In these apps, /you/ control space and time – and
all the data is real.
