I had an opportunity to talk about NASA Open Government Initiative and the use of Social Media to engage citizen’s at the [Gov 2.0 Conference](http://www.gov2.com.au/) early today at the National Convention Center in Canberra, Australia. The presentation builds on a number of previous presentations about Open Government and social media at NASA, and continues to explore how YOU can engage citizens in your mission by better understanding on how to harness the opportunities Open Government presents.   We talked a lot about how to engaging citizens through the use of Web 2.0 technology and how government agencies move towards an open and transparent government.  The presentation covers a lot of best practices from recent work at NASA.

[Chris Gerty](http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/cgerty/) and I have also been experimenting with some video animation techniques and I used the Q&A portion of today’s talk to recap the talk with the following video.  It’s still rough, and we’re still experimenting with the technique, but I think it really turned out well!
