Slug: year-in-review

As 2011 comes to a close, we would like to share a special thank you to
everyone who has supported the Open Government Initiative this past
year. We have come a long way this year and to celebrate the many
accomplishments, we created an annual report infographic that shares
some of the impressive highlights related to Open Government at NASA
from the past 12 months. In 2012, we look forward to continuing to work
with you to share NASA's data, push forward the use of Open Source
technologies, and create new participatory opportunities to engage
citizens in our space exploration and aeronautics mission
