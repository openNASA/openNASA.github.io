*111 orgs, 25 cities, 17 countries, 2,083 pple, 71 challenges, 100+
solutions in 48 hours.

This weekend, NASA successfully fulfilled a commitment on behalf of the
United States as part of the \ `Open Government Partnership`_ Domestic
Action Plan.  The stated goal of the event, per the \ `US Action Plan`_,
was to "*promote innovation through international collaboration*\ ".
Space exploration was the ideal catalyst to foster this culture of
innovation, and NASA, in collaboration with \ `8 government
agencies`_ and `103 other organizations`_, hosted the International
Space Apps Challenge in \ `25 cities`_ in 17 countries on all seven
continents and online.  The event held 21-22 April 2012 brought together
2,083 registered participants (ages 16-70) together to address \ `71
challenges`_.  More than \ `100 unique solutions`_ were developed in
less then 48 hours during the event.  All solutions were developed in a
completely open source environment, and each have their own unique
potential to go even further to address world and space technology
challenges.

In addition to the technology developed, the event itself generated
considerable media coverage for the agency, resulting in \ `72 English
articles`_, including landing on the front of the \ `BBC`_ website on 21
April 2012.  `Gov2.0Radio`_ provided special coverage for the event
which included 45 interviews with organizers, experts and participants
from all locations.  The entire event was streamed online to thousands
of people around the world, and although hard to measure the total
viewership, the twitter stream alone generated 3.3M impressions.

We have compiled a small cross-section of 11 examples, that represent
the quality of the technology developed. Over the next few days, we will
be featuring the top 50 `solutions`_ on this website and `Innovation
Endeavours`_ and `Talenthouse`_ will start the global judging process.

    **Predict the Sky** - An app that combines ISS, HST and weather
    forecast data for a specified location to inform people about what
    they'll be able to see in the night sky.

    **Planet Hopper** - An app that visualizes Kepler data to allow
    children and teachers to explore all the exoplanets that we know
    about.

    **MyTravelImpact **- An app that uses NASA weather satellite data to
    bring carbon footprint computation down to the individual level,
    allowing trends to be associated with decisions people make based on
    weather conditions and convenience of transportation options.
     Further application could include city planning based on climate
    change predictions.

    **Growers Nation** - A collaboration between developers in Exeter,
    San Francisco, New York City, Santiago, Nairobi and Santo Domingo,
    that explores the potential of unused land for the growing of fruit,
    vegetable and other crops through the use of location, climate and
    agriculture data.

    **HazardMap** - A real-time hazard map application that is powered
    by social media observations to help provide a a useful risk
    assessment for potential (and actual) crisis situations.

    **Commonality of NASA Datasets** - A data schema attempts to capture
    the commonalities between datasets acquired by NASA to allow citizen
    scientists and data mining softwares to quickly locate relevant
    datasets required to answer questions posed in broad terms, such as
    "Has the sea level risen in the last 10 years?"

    **Aeration & Low Temperature Baking** - An energy efficient, self
    sufficient process to produce ordinary, fresh bread with minimal
    ingredients at lower, safer temperatures in a limited resource
    environment.

    **Solar Wind Visualization** - A desktop client that takes solar
    wind speed live from the web and produces an animation of the
    current wind speeds. The same feed is also used by an Arduino to
    show the live intensity of the solar winds by lighting more lights
    the more intense the winds.

    **NASA Open Data API** - A preliminary design and schema for a NASA
    Open Data API to improve accessibility and a unified interface to
    NASA datasets without requiring specialist knowledge.

    **ISS Open Hardware Design** - An open hardware design that
    visualizes the location of the ISS in space.  The distance is
    calculated and if closer than 15,000km (ground projection) lights
    are turned on using an Arduino. The closer the ISS the more lights
    that are lit topping out at 10 lights when within 0.5km.

    **A View from Space** - An app that restricts a shared social media
    stream based on the orbit of the ISS in order to provide a common
    viewpoint and build a community around space data based on location.
