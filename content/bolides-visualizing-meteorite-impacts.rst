We are always on the lookout for great visualizations of space data and
this one `Carlo Zapponi`_ does not disappoint.

The visualization titled `BOLIDES`_ is a beautiful representation of the
data from the The Meteoritical Society on all the known meteorites that
have hit Earth.  The design focuses on those meteorites that were
eye-witnessed when falling and hitting the ground - as of 1997, there
were 961 eye-witnessed meteorites out of the 34,842 total found.

The visualization is built with HTML5 and uses custom graphics.  You can
read more about it on his `blog`_ and view more wonderful
visualizations on his website \ http://www.makinguse.com/.

an attempt to visualize and explore the meteorites that have collided
with the Earth. The visualization focuses mainly on meteorites that were
eye-witnessed when falling and hitting the ground. Data from the
