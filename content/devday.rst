Dev/day is a 7.5 hour-long intensive event that will be held on Tuesday
July 9th, 2013, from 9:00 AM – 4:30 PM at NASA Johnson Space Center in
the new 1958 collaborative space. The event is designed to allow a
select group of 50 of the Agency’s brightest to conceive, design and
implement compelling solutions to further NASA’s mission. This is a bold
and innovative experiment in collectively inventing our future and we
are excited that you have been chosen to participate in this inaugural
event. We hope you will be able to join us!

The event is inspired by the International Space Apps Challenge,
sponsored by the Office of Human Capital and hosted by the NASA Open
Innovation Team.
