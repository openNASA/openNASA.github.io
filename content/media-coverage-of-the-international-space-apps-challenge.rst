In 3 days, nearly `1,800 people`_\ (and counting) from around the world
will come together in 24 cities (and online) to participate in the
`International Space Apps Challenge`_. The event is truly a global
collaboration with `over 100 organizations and government entities`_
from around the world participating. During the event, "*citizens from
around the world will work together to solve current challenges relevant
to both space exploration and social need... using minimal resources and
maximum brainpower to create outside-the-box solutions in response to
interesting problems*." We couldn't be more excited!

The event has recieved quite a bit of `media coverage`_, including press
releases, blog posts, news articles, and podcasts. We've been doing our
best to collect them all on our `press page`_, but if we missed
