Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative encompassing a core team of collaborators including NASA, World Bank, Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and HP, an ever expanding ecosystem of supporting organizations, and a community of over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries collectively working to make the world a better place.

The effort, which is only three years old, has resulted in 177 hackathons in 37 different countries producing thousands of solutions. There are a number of past RHoK projects that serve as guiding examples of whatâ€™s possible in just 48 hours, from those developed in the early days and still in use like CHASM, Open Street Map Tasking Manager, Risk-in-a-Box (now InaSAFE), First Responder and Caritas Disaster Mapping, as well as Bushfire Connect, to more recent RHoK projects like PhillySNAP, Sheltr, WaterVoices, AdHawk, Bring the Food, Yo! Philly Votes, Councilmatic, FourTeachersProject and Taarifa.

We have released an annual report on the Random Hacks of Kindness global initiative that describes its beginnings, the hackathon process, the initiatives impact, the amazing community, and how you can be a part of it.
