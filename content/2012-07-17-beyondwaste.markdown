_This post by Open Government collaborator Beth Beck is crossposted from her blog [here](http://bethbeck.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/stay-tuned-for-launch-beyond-waste/). We hope you'll join us this week and follow along with the event!_

It’s finally here — [LAUNCH: Beyond Waste](http://bethbeck.wordpress.com/2012/03/03/launch-culture-of-collaboration/)! We’ve been working for the last six months to get to this point. We head out to Pasadena, California this week to hear from nine innovators with creative ways to create value from discarded products  – plastic bottles, human and plant waste, unused fabric, and more.

LAUNCH, _for those of you who haven’t heard me talk about it before_, is a social entrepreneurship enterprise that breaks new ground in public/private partnerships. We created the LAUNCH program three years ago to address large, sustainability-related challenges that no single government or commercial entity can solve alone. Our talented [LAUNCH team](http://launch.org/team_page/) searches for transformative innovations, which we connect with a collaborative group of thought leaders and experts which we call [LAUNCH Council](http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste/council). LAUNCH Innovators are uniquely poised to accelerate their innovations for greater impact and scale by leveraging the advice, networks, and resources of the [LAUNCH Council](http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste/council) members and the global stage LAUNCH provides.

**The ultimate goal of LAUNCH is a sustainable future for planet Earth and her citizens.**

The [LAUNCH: Beyond Wast](http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste)e forum is the fourth in a series of challenges, following Water, Health, and Energy. The LAUNCH team focused on waste as a challenge topic in order to address increasing strain on the planet’s limited resources. Global citizens, as well as explorers who leave Earth’s protection, share the need for creative solutions to the issue of waste — from designing for zero waste to revaluing existing waste from inefficient production and processes. LAUNCH: Beyond Waste addresses this global challenge.

I love the tagline from [Anshu Gupta of Goonj](http://launch.org/forum/11/beyond-waste/innovators/42/goonj/profile), one of our innovators from India, who wants to transform the cash society into a trash society — meaning trash = revenue stream. Our western version: one man’s trash is another man’s treasure.

Here are the cool movie posters our team (Trish and Lilly) created to represent each innovation we’ll feature at the forum.
