*"Even in hindsight, I would not change one whit of the Voyager
experience. Dreams and sweat carried it off. But most of all, its legacy
makes us all Earth travelers among the stars." Charles Kohlhase, Voyager
Mission Analysis Engineer*

For the last 33 years, the twin Voyager spacecraft have been exploring
the edges of the solar system. Since 1998, it is the most distant
man-made object from earth, and continues to be one of the most prolific
sources of planetary data for NASA. The mission continues to be a leader
in science and science data. Per the crafts’ approximate 2011 locations,
ground signals traveling at the speed of light take about 13 hours one
way to reach Voyager 2, and 16 hours one way to reach Voyager 1.

Voyager’s final mission is to study the heliopause, the boundary at
which the solar wind transitions into the interstellar medium.
Scientists expect that Voyager 1 will cross the heliopause sometime
between 2012-2015, continuing to truly push the boundaries of the known
universe.

**Some of Voyager’s key scientific efforts**:

-  Imaging Science System: utilizes a two-camera system
   (narrow-angle/wide-angle) to provide imagery of Jupiter, Saturn and
   other objects
-  Radio Science System: utilizes the telecommunications system of the
   Voyager spacecraft to determine the physical properties of planets
   and satellites and the amount and size distribution of material in
   Saturn's rings and the ring dimensions.
-  Infrared Interferometer Spectrometer: investigates both global and
   local energy balance and atmospheric composition.
-  Ultraviolet Spectrometer: designed to measure atmospheric properties
   and radiation
-  Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer: designed to investigate the magnetic
   fields of Jupiter and Saturn, the solar-wind interaction with the
   magnetospheres of these planets, and the interplanetary magnetic
   field out to the solar wind boundary with the interstellar magnetic
   field and beyond
-  Plasma Spectrometer: investigates the macroscopic properties of the
   plasma ions and measures electrons
-  Low Energy Charged Particle Instrument: measures the differential in
   energy fluxes and angular distributions of ions, electrons and the
   differential in energy ion composition.
-  Cosmic Ray System: determines the origin and acceleration process,
   life history, and dynamic contribution of interstellar cosmic rays,
   the nucleosynthesis of elements in cosmic-ray sources, the behavior
   of cosmic rays in the interplanetary medium, and the trapped
   planetary energetic-particle environment.
-  Planetary Radio Astronomy: utilizes a sweep-frequency radio receiver
   to study the radio-emission signals from Jupiter and Saturn
-  Photo Polarimeter: utilizes a telescope with a polarizer to gather
   information on surface texture and composition of Jupiter and Saturn
   and information on atmospheric scattering properties and density for
   both planets
-  Plasma Wave System: provides continuous, sheath-independent
   measurements of the electron-density profiles at Jupiter and Saturn
   as well as basic information on local wave-particle interaction,
   useful in studying the magnetospheres

**The Golden Record: REALLY Open Data**

Both Voyager spacecraft carry recorded messages from Earth on golden
phonograph records – 12-inch, gold-plated copper disks. A committee
chaired by the late astronomer Carl Sagan selected the contents of the
records for NASA. The records are cultural time capsules that the
Voyagers carry with them to other star systems. They contain images and
natural sounds, spoken greetings in 55 languages and musical selections
from different cultures and eras.

**Education Outreach**

The Voyager team has also been incredibly committed to doing student
outreach to celebrate “humanity’s furthest journey” and invite students
to connect with the team and the science behind the mission. Wonder what
kind of questions the students had about Voyager? Check out their
questions and the NASA Voyager team’s answers here:
