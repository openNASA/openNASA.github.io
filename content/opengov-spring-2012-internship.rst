**Deadline Extended:** Applications now due at 11:59pm EST on Friday,
October 28, 2011

Are you a college student looking to make a difference in your
world...and beyond? Do you love the idea of using technology make
government more collaborative, participatory, and transparent? Does your
childhood dream of someday working for NASA still live on?

If you've answered yes to the above questions, and you'll be spending
your 2012 spring semester in either Washington, DC, or Houston, TX, then
read on! The NASA Open Government Initiative is looking for innovative
undergraduates to join our team for one-semester internships at NASA
Headquarters and NASA Johnson Space Center.

**What is the NASA Open Government Initiative?**

The Open Government Initiative is an innovative strategy for changing
how government works. The aim of open government is to take advantage of
the know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of those outside government
institutions to work together with those inside government to solve
problems. Open Government is all about embracing the concept of "open
innovation" - the idea that working in a transparent, participatory, and
collaborative fashion helps improve performance, inform decision-making,
encourage entrepreneurship, and solve problems more effectively.

As a member of NASA's OpenGov team, you'll be working on a number of
projects throughout the agency related to open government activities.
Some examples of projects we'll have you working on include:

#. Collaborating with NASA scientists and engineers across the country
   to help make data from their missions publicly available
#. Working with graphic designers, web developers, and creative artists
   to find ways to showcase NASA initiatives to members of the public.
#. Helping guide NASA's policy and strategy on Open Source Software
   development
#. Working with partners from Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, HP, and the
   World Bank on `Random Hacks Of Kindness`_
#. Writing white papers and briefing NASA management on the progress of
   OpenGov activities in the agency.
#. Blogging about your experience on `open.NASA.gov`_

A huge part of this internship will be self-guidance. Much like Google's
20% time, we'll want you to take part of your time here to start your
own OpenGov project. We'll work with you to find a project you are
interested in and passionate about, then allow you to take the reins and
manage it. In the past, OpenGov interns have created Android Apps using
NASA data, the `OpenGov Progress Dashboard`_, and worked on projects
like `Fragile Oasis`_ and `NASA Tweetups`_.

Although we have no requirement for a specific major or program for
applicants, **this position will be primarily policy-focused**. Thus, a
background in public policy, political science, business, or a related
field will be extremely useful. A love for space exploration and an
inquisitive nature are essential, as are self-motivation, strong writing
chops and experience in using web technologies. Additionally, knowledge
of HTML/CSS and Wordpress are desired but not required. To apply, fill
out the form below. **Applications are due [STRIKEOUT:Sunday, October 9,
2011] Friday, October 28, 2011 at 11:59pm Eastern Time. This position is
unpaid.**
