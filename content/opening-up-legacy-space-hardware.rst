Many of us now working at NASA reflect on our elementary school days,
when we were first inspired by the space program. We saw these amazing
achievements and thought, quite accurately, that there was cutting-edge
technology at work, being developed by brilliant engineers. Oh, how we
longed to work alongside and someday become one of those engineers!

Taking a look at the achievements of today, nothing is lost from that
effect. Skycranes and spacesuits still inspire. Galaxies are discovered
with lenses and techniques that boggle the mind. The hardware being
developed at NASA is truly cutting edge.

But what happens to all of this cutting edge hardware in the long-term.
Does it retain its impact to society, its relevance to our planet, and
most compellingly - its coolness factor? Is open source technology
itself, powered by its community, encouraged to reach for the stars - in
much the same way we were in elementary school?

| As a tribute to the relevance and enduring global impact of NASA
technology, we would like to highlight a video blog we stumbled upon
today. Fran Blanche acquired a piece of hardware called the Launch
Vehicle Digital Computer, which in her words is the "most important
circuit board in history".

Fran's quest is to learn more about the design decisions made in the
past as they relate to the open source hardware movement of today. Her
enthusiasm for the impact of the inner-workings of the LVDC brings this
Computer Engineer back to the days I dreamed of working at NASA. Her
follow-up video where she actually `takes the board to her dentist for
x-rays`_ is just as awesome.... and I hope she finds more and more
answers as she continues her quest! (an introduction is needed between
Fran and Ben Krasnow with his `Arduino-controlled CT scanner`_!)

In many ways we have come full-circle. The open source community is
making the same decisions that NASA engineers made in Apollo, but for
flexibility and hack-ability desires of today rather than reliability
and manufacturability challenges of the past. Can this global community
collaboratively make the next giant leap? Are we witnessing a rebirth of
electronic technology development?

What else could this open source community learn from NASA's legacy?

And what could the NASA of today learn from theirs?
