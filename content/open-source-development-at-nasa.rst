NASA has a special association with the principles of openness and
transparency characteristic of the open source software movement.
 Signed into law on July 29, 1958 by President Eisenhower, the `National
Aeronautics and Space Act`_ created NASA and charged it with, among
other things, providing for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof.  Manifestations of this duty can be observed across all of the
Agency’s mission and business functions, from `high resolution
photography`_ and reports on `planetary discovery`_ to `financial
transparency`_ and `independent oversight`_.

A particularly direct form of this transparency can be seen in NASA’s
efforts to release open source software.  In 2003, NASA published `a
report`_ assessing the formal barriers to distributing NASA software as
open source and reviewing the state of open source licenses.
 Subsequently, NASA developed an `open source license`_ and changed
`relevant policies`_ to permit the release of NASA software under this
license.  `Several projects`_ have since taken advantage of this work by
releasing their code as open source.

`NASA World Wind`_, a 3D interactive world viewer and winner of the
`2009 NASA Software of the Year award`_, stands out as a shining example
of the potential impact of open source NASA software.  Used by citizens,
scientists, and organizations such as the European Space Agency, the
Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, PEMEX (Mexico Petroleum Company),
General Dynamics, World Bank, Sun Microsystems, IBM, Northrop Grumman,
and the Government of Australia, World Wind has made a significant
impact on increasing public access to geologic data.

These efforts have validated the benefits inherent to releasing open
source software.  In furtherance of NASA’s open source efforts, we are
currently working toward expanding our flexibility to engage in
`bazaar-style`_, bi-lateral open development where code is developed
over the Internet in full view of the public from the outset.  This
approach holds the promise of increased software quality, reduced
development costs, accelerated software development cycles, reduced
barriers for public-private collaboration, commercialization of Agency
technology, and a higher rate of technology transfer both to and from
NASA.

NASA’s first foray into this area was through the `Nebula Cloud
Computing project`_.  Nebula started as a software development effort in
2008 to create a private cloud computing platform utilizing free and
open source software.  As a corollary of this architectural direction,
the team set about releasing its software under free and open source
licenses to engage a community in expeditiously advancing the state and
capabilities of open cloud computing.  Towards this end, the `Nebula
project worked with policy makers and stake holders across the Agency`_
to enable a construct wherein the team would be able to engage in
ongoing public development of the Nebula software under the Apache 2.0
license.  In this way, the project was able to work with other
interested developers at an early stage, building the software alongside
a diverse array of individuals and organizations.  After taking notice
of NASA’s work in this area, `Rackspace open sourced their Cloud Files
platform`_.  This act provided the impetus for NASA and Rackspace to
join their respective efforts under a common banner: `OpenStack`_.  The
ensuing public interest in OpenStack has been staggering, with nearly
`1500 individuals`_ and `110 organizations`_ currently participating in
some way to advance the project.

Given Nebula and OpenStack’s success, it became apparent that
bazaar-style development held the potential for bringing significant
value to NASA projects.  However, the Nebula experience illustrated that
NASA’s open source policies favor the `cathedral model`_ of development
where an isolated group of developers work on a project and release
infrequent iterations at the conclusion of development cycles. To better
understand NASA’s open source posture and to advance open development as
a formal option for NASA developers, we held an `Open Source Summit`_ in
March at `NASA Ames Research Center`_.  This event brought together
engineers, policy makers, and members of the open source community to
discuss our existing open source policy framework and to chart a course
toward bi-lateral open source development.  There were a number of `key
recommendations from the summit`_, among them:

   <ul>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Imbue an Open Source-First Culture.  Work to promote open source
development and release in NASA software projects through project,
budgetary, and organizational incentives.

   </li>

   <li>

Knock Down Barriers to Community. Clarify and reduce barriers to direct
NASA participation in open source communities, governing boards, and
related structures.  Clarify contributor license agreement requirements
to facilitate code contributions to NASA projects.  Further, clearly
describe restrictions and regulations which are peculiar to the
government, such as the `International Traffic in Arms Regulations`_.

.. raw:: html

   </li>

.. raw:: html

   <li>

Communicate. Highly visible communication about NASA’s open source
process and projects along with community management and ongoing fora
for discussion will increase awareness and help more projects explore
open source options.  Activities like the summit, coding contests,
hackathons, and similar events will highlight open source opportunities
for internal and external parties.

   <li>

Deprecate NASA’s License. The `NASA Open Source Software Agreement`_ was
developed in 2003 as a means to enable public release of NASA source
code.  This license received Open Source Initiative `approval`_, but
`has been criticized`_ for potentially hindering code reuse. In 2006,
the Open Source Initiative issued a `report`_ on the problem of license
proliferation identifying three consequences:

.. raw:: html

   </li>

#. the perception that there are too many licenses,
#. difficulty arising from license incompatibility,
#. and the expense of having to read and understand so many varied
   licenses.

.. raw:: html

   <li style="list-style-type: none;">

Although the report excepts NASA’s license as necessary due to unique
government constraints, Summit participants suggested that NASA should
deprecate this license and re-license previously released software under
a mainstream open source license.  Further, they suggested that NASA
should approve a subset of mainstream licenses for NASA use and
centralize guidance for license selection for new projects.

In the coming months, the Open Government team along with others
throughout the Agency will work toward implementing these and other
suggestions to expand the open source options available to NASA
developers.  The benefits of bi-lateral open source development are
undeniable, and NASA is uniquely positioned to inspire the public to
directly participate in building the systems that will enable us to
expand human knowledge of the Earth and propel us deeper into the
recesses of space.
