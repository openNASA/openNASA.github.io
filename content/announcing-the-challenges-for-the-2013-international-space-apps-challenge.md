The [International Space Apps Challenge][] is an international mass
collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over
48-hours in cities [around the world][]. The event embraces
collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant
open-source solutions. Today, we are announcing the challenges for this
years event!  The challenges are focused on improving life on Earth and
life in space in the areas of open source software, open hardware, data
visualization and citizen science. As we get closer to the event expect
more detail, data resources, and content to help you in your work. You
can find out more about all the challenges at
