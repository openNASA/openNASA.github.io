The 5th Global Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) event took place this
weekend in 34 cities around the world, with close to 2,000 developers
"hacking for humanity." RHoK is a collaboration between NASA, Google,
Microsoft, HP, Yahoo and Worldbank. With this weekendâ€™s events, RHoK has
now reached a total 99 hackathons worldwide and has engaged nearly 6,000
technologists, designers and citizens in its events! Cities joining RHoK
for the first time included Banjul in the Gambia; Pretoria, South
Africa; Antwerp, Belgium; Rosario, Argentina; Warsaw, Poland; London and
Oxford in the U.K., Montreal and Hamilton in Canada and Austin,
Milwaukee, Manchester, Princeton and Portland in the U.S.

The NASA Open Government team was active a number of locations and
blogged throughout the weekend about the many solutions developed. We
also teamed up with Astronaut Ron Garan and others to to host a
challenge called the "Collaboration Project" which challenged the
community to build a robust, user-friendly database and visualization of
collaboration projects worldwide that is easily accessed with all
metadata. There are an estimated 20 million governments, NGOs and aid
organizations aimed at making the world a better place.
