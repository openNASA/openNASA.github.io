The International Space Apps Challenge team has been hard at work with the preparations for the upcoming global event in April. We're building collaborations, reviewing challenges, and preparing for the largest exploration-focused mass collaboration that the world has ever seen.

One of the most frequent questions we get for Space Apps is **"where will it be held?"** The answer is: _everywhere_! There will be 50 local events and then extensive virtual participation - so you can participate, either in person or online, from any place on Earth (or in space!) A number of agencies and organizations are working together on every continent to bring Space Apps to you, and we are excited to announce the first round of confirmed cities today:

**North America:**
New York City, NY
Syracuse, NY
Rochester, NY
Reno, NV
Detroit, MI
