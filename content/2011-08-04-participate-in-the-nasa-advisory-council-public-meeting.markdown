The NASA Advisory Council (NAC) is meeting today at Ames Research Center, and you can join the conversation by phone, webex or in person!  If you are interested, visit the [NAC’s homepage](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/nac/home/index.html) or see below for more information.

**Background on NAC:**

The NASA Advisory Council (NAC) provides the NASA Administrator with counsel and advice on programs and issues of importance to the Agency. The Council consists of nine committees, Aeronautics, Audit, Finance and Analysis, Commercial Space, Education and Public Outreach, Exploration, Information Technology Infrastructure, Science, Space Operations, and Technology and Innovation. Each committee conducts sessions throughout the year in an effort to gain a broad understanding of current NASA issues and future mission implementation plans. The committees then bring their proposed observations, findings, and recommendations to the full Council for deliberation and final decision on whether to send forward to the NASA Administrator.

The Council deliberates on topics raised by each committee in public sessions and presents any observations, findings, and recommendations to the NASA Administrator on a quarterly basis.
