This past weekend, I had the opportunity to join fellow openNASAer Chris
Gerty at [Science Hack Day San Francisco][]. Science Hack Day brings
together designers, developers, scientists and other geeks in the same
physical space for a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking,
and building ‘cool stuff’ focused on science. I went to[last year's
event][] as well and was super impressed with the many awesome projects
that came out of the weekend - this year was no let down, either!

We began the weekend by offering a lightening talk on some of the many
NASA-related data resources available out there that participants could
use in their projects, including [data.nasa.gov][], [Helioviewer][],
[exoAPI][], and [ECHO][].

Throughout the weekend, we aimed to be the "NASA boots on the ground" -
offering help to those who wanted to do things with our data or focus on
space exploration. It was incredible to see so many intelligent people
in one room so excited about science - many of whom also participated in
the [International Space Apps Challenge][] last April.

Here's a quick run down of some of the completed projects from the
weekend.  
**Openpost  
**[http://openpost.com**  
**][]Openpost is a quick way to summarize events that are posted to
mailing lists. Simply subscribe openpost to your favorite mailing lists
and go to a URL you create to see a calendar view of upcoming events
mentioned on the list. It's a great way to de-clutter your inbox without
missing important info!

**Truthiness  
**[http://truthiness.herokuapp.com  
https://github.com/benjuang/truthiness**  
**][]Truthiness is a simple site devoted to clearing up misconceptions
about popular science topics. By sharing unbiased information coupled
with quizzes and social integration, Truthiness aims to make everyday
life more understandable.

**TwitterDots**  
<http://twitterdots.net/>  
<https://github.com/fennb/phirehose>  
TwitterDots is a real-time visualization of Twitter keyword data.
Inputting a keyword shows you geolocated data of where people around the
world are discussing that keyword. In the demo, the team demoed the tool
showing likely Romney and Obama voted based on language processing from
voter's tweets.

**GeoMappit**  
[http://geomappit.net/][]  
[https://github.com/basilleaf/geomappit][]  
GeoMappit takes USGS data and mashes it up with Google Fusion tables to
create an interactive map to display information about interesting
geological features in your backyard!

**CoGeNT Symphony and the Sounds of Dark Matter**  
<http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~bellis/cogent_sonification/>  
|The GoGeNT Symphony took sonic mappings from data generated by the
CoGeNT dark matter detection experiment to create a musical
interpretation of the sound of radioactive decay.

**Jamion**  
![Jamion ScreenShot][]  
Jamion compares San Francisco public transit flow to condensed matter
physics in order to make predictions about future SFMTA traffic jams.

**Evan XD**  
Evan designed a computer program that, when coupled with special
glasses, enables color-blind individuals to see patterns that otherwise
would be difficult or impossible to discern.

**Wrist-Based Input**  
<https://gist.github.com/4013771>  
Rio created a wrist-mounted sensor array that detects movement in the
hands and wrist using machine learning.

**Quantum Mixology**  
<http://www.slideshare.net/physicsdavid/quantum-mixology>  
This project mapped fundamental particles to cocktail ingredients and
made a series of recipes with a definite quantum theme!

**Schrodinger's Quest: Hunt for the Higgs**  
![][]  
This team took data from the Large Hadron Collider and created a game
where the player throws protons together using motion detection and
attempts to identify the Higgs Boson appearing.

**Browser Collider**  
<http://bloodyepic.com/images/picture1.png>  
Browser Collider visualizes what happens inside the Large Hadron
Collider on your web browser.

**Baudio**  
Baudio hacked together a way to collect audio feedback from our
physiology. The example connected a EEG to a speaker and allows the user
to control the pitch of the tone generated by using their mind.

**Election Bot**

> Putting the finishing touches on [\#ElectionBot][] !

<p>
<script charset="utf-8" type="text/javascript" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script>
  
ElectionBot built a robot out of an electric wheel chair that polls
user's sentiment about recent political issues and presents aggregated
data on sentiment around the US.

**GelloShotElectrophoresis**  
<https://secure.flickr.com/groups/2091253@N24/>  
This hack replaced Gel Electrophoresis chemicals with Salt Subsitute
and Lime Juice.

**NationRank**  
<https://github.com/Empact/nationrank>  
NationRank creats meta-indicies of nations according to published
values such as Press Freedoms.

**Zendosaur**  
<http://muga2.com/zendosaur/>  
<https://github.com/gossamr/zendosaur>  
Young children can make incredible observations and recognize hard to
see patterns. Zendosaur serves as a puzzle game that challenges players
to create hypothesis about the types of foods a dinosaur may want to eat
and test them out with various experiments.

**KineSutra**  
<http://kinesutra.wordpress.com/>  
<https://github.com/CodeStrumpet/KineSutra>  
KineSutra uses Kinect based body recognition coupled with a haptic
feedback suit to instruct dancers to follow a pre-set routine.

**Constellation**  
[http://mattsenate.github.com/constellation/][]  
[https://github.com/mattsenate/constellation][]  
Constellation is a web tool that takes patterns and identifies clusters
of stars in the sky that match those patterns. Instant constellation
creation!
