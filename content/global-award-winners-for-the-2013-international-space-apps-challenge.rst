The results from 2013 International Space Apps Challenge are incredible.
More than 9,000 hackers, designers, and explorers in 83 cities and from
all corners of the world made this the largest hackathon in history. An
unbelievable 770 solutions were submitted, and thousands of people
worked together to address challenges and create immeasurable amount of
enthusiasm and investment in exploration.

Of those solutions, 134 were nominated for global recognition. Over the
past few weeks we have reviewed each and every one of them, a truly
inspirational process. A panel of judges consisting of representatives
from NASA and other governmental and non-governmental organizations
evaluated the top solutions, and today we are announcing the six best in
class winners.
