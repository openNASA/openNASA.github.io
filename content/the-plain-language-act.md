The Plain Language Act directs agencies to write in clear,
understandable language.  At NASA we have many types of correspondence,
ranging from scientific summaries to press releases to rules and
directives.  As you can imagine, technical terms can be hard to
understand.  Our goal is to do our best to follow the intent of the
Plain Language Act and make our communications easier to read and to
understand.  Like other Federal agencies, we are used to certain styles
of writing and find it hard to "break that mold."  However, we pledge to
do our best to write in a common-sense style that will make it easier
for you to understand what we are trying to say.  We have many
fascinating missions going on across the Agency, and we hope that our
new emphasis on plain language writing will help keep you interested and
informed.

Please take a look at the Government’s Plain Language Web site at
[www.plainlanguage.gov/index.cfm][] and at NASA's Open Government Web
site at <http://www.nasa.gov/open/plainlanguage.html> and tell me what
you think.  There are several links on these sites that will give you a
good look at what plain language is all about.  I look forward to
hearing from you.
