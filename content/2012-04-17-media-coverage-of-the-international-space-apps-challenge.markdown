In 3 days, nearly [1,800 people ](http://spaceappschallenge.org/)(and counting) from around the world will come together in 24 cities (and online) to participate in the [International Space Apps Challenge](http://spaceappschallenge.org). The event is truly a global collaboration with [over 100 organizations and government entities](http://spaceappschallenge.org/partners/) from around the world participating. During the event, "_citizens from around the world will work together to solve current challenges relevant to both space exploration and social need... using minimal resources and maximum brainpower to create outside-the-box solutions in response to interesting problems_." We couldn't be more excited!

The event has recieved quite a bit of [media coverage](http://spaceappschallenge.org/press/), including press releases, blog posts, news articles, and podcasts. We've been doing our best to collect them all on our [press page](http://spaceappschallenge.org/press/), but if we missed something, _please let us know_!

Leading up to the event, [Gov2.0Radio](http://gov20radio.com/spaceapps) has produced a series of really engaging interviews with organizers, subject matter experts and local organizers from around the world, including:
