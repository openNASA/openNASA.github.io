    I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways
    that will restore the health and, in so doing, secure hope for
    humankind. Health to the ocean means health for us. —Sylvia Earle

On July 16 `One World One Ocean`_ will join `Dr. Sylvia Earle`_,
National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence, Liquid Pictures 3D, and a
team of aquanauts for a 6-day expedition to a "research only" zone in
Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, home to `Aquarius`_, the last
remaining underwater lab in the world. Since 1993, America's "*inner
space station*\ " has helped us understand the disappearance of coral
reefs, train NASA astronauts for space and research sea sponges, the
source of two cancer drugs. The discoveries made at Aquarius have opened
our eyes to how little we really know about the vast complexity of the
ocean. It is one of the planet's most important brain trusts, and it is
about to be closed.

| This may be the final mission to Aquarius Reef Base! One World One
Ocean will capture all the action with live interviews and in-depth
coverage. Check out this video that truly captures the beauty of the
Aquarius habitat using
|  IMAX, RED, GoPro and DSLR cameras.
