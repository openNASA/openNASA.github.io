excerpt: 'It''s time to "…find groups of people, bring them together around an issue
  or problem that needs to be fixed, then step out of the way and let the collective
  energy of the people in the room come together and really take that data and solve
  things in creative and imaginative ways that we would never have done ourselves." '

[Global voting starts today for the International Space Apps Challenge](http://www.talenthouse.com/international-space-apps-challenge)! The Space Apps Challenge fosters innovation by providing a platform for citizens from around the world to work together to solve current challenges relevant to both space exploration and social need. The [Innovation Endeavors](http://innovationendeavors.com/) and [Talenthouse](http://www.talenthouse.com/creative) community of investors, entrepreneurs and advisors are here to support and celebrate these teams and their innovations to the fifty challenges - and invite you to vote for your favorite App. The final winners will be determined with your votes and along with an internationally recognized jury of investors and entrepreneurs from Innovation Endeavors.

The videos submitted on behalf of each nominated project also demonstrate the vision of the collaboration process, the passion of the participants, and what it means to them to engage the data in their context. These videos tell the story about what is possible when people get a vision about exploration and for changing the world with science. _What earth observation data could help people, organizations, and governments make better decisions? How can we convey the orbital perspective to people on Earth? What are other low-cost off-the-shelf hardware options for exploration? What are new ways we could visualize data? How else could we communicate ideas too big for words or organize data bigger than we have yet been able to manage? What new things can we learn when we mashup data sources? How can we share data more efficiently?_ Space Apps asked all these questions in the global community - and discovered some interesting ideas and answers along the way.

[Aurora Project: Model & Data](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/aurora-layer-google-earth/solution/136) ([Dublin, Ireland](http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/tog)) An app that visualizes near-real time aurora data. During the Science Hack Day Dublin in March, we built up an Aurora Lamp. This consisted on an artistic representation of an Aurora using LEDs. However, this was not connected with any data feed. For the Space Apps Challenge we tried to improve this original project by using real data. On one side we developed a program that automatically downloads and processes data from NOAA's POES satellites. This gives an indication of aurora activity. However, as the satellites measure just what is below them the data needs to be extrapolated to show all the hemisphere. Simultaneously, we also developed software to generate a layer for Google Earth showing the forecast of aurora activity. This is based on magnetic field measurements from NASA's ACE spacecraft.

[Code/Game Controller/Water Sampling Mechanism OpenROV Framework Development Challenge](https://open.nasa.gov/wp-admin/Code/Game%20Controller/Water%20Sampling%20Mechanism%20OpenROV%20Framework%20Development%20challenge) ([San Francisco, USA](http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/techshop)) OpenROV is a DIY telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration and education. The community has developed a low-cost telerobotic submarine that can be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and is increasingly capable of doing serious scientific research. The goal of the project is to democratize exploration by allowing anyone to explore and study underwater environments. The OpenROV community is also laying the foundation for globally-connected citizen scientists to share their data and findings. [Vote here.](http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/show/submission/detail/WP23KX)

When complete, it will include the growing conditions required for different varieties of fruit, vegetables and grains. During the challenge weekend, we had some great collaborations with teams from around the world including: Exeter, San Francisco, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Nairobi and New York. We hope to continue collaborating with related projects into the future. There is a lot of potential for follow on work from this project and the Growers Nation team members are enthusiastic to continue working on what they regard as a very worthwhile project.

[Connect and Survive!](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/welovedata-challenge/solution/37) ([Exeter, United Kingdom](http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/met-office)) We want people to learn to manage long-term healthcare through connecting to healthcare information in their homes. If we only ever use computers to connect people to data then we are neglecting the majority of the global population. At the SpaceApps Challenge in Exeter we made a demonstrator Pollen Predictor that used live pollen data to change the colour of a 3D printed pollen ball. The colour of the ball is used to represent the next day's pollen level. So what next? We would love to develop this into a standalone Physical App that enables people to see data. In the first place we would like to design products to help children manage asthma caused by pollen allergies and to test this across a range of cultures and languages. [Vote here. ](http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/show/submission/detail/PW69PM)

[CERES](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/commodities-pricing-tool-rural-communities/solution/89) ([New York, New York](http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/pivotal-labs)) Farmers in the developing world lack proper access to food pricing information. Without proper information, rural farmers are vulnerable to a variety of problems.CERES solves these problems by allowing farmers to exchange commodity price information with their peers, allowing them to make better-informed decisions. Farmers interact with the service by using SMS to check current prices within seconds. For large purchasers and governments, CERES provides a powerful web interface for decision makers to view the data in aggregate. Over the coming months, our launch partner, Opportunity International - Nicaragua, will be piloting our application in rural Nicaragua. Won't you join us in driving economic transformation? [Vote here.](http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/preview/ac19c0ec35da61e8c028dbf1d4ec99c3/571)
