Crafting our world sounds like a lot of hard work and nearly impossible
for one person. Well, guess what? The 2^nd^ round of International Space
Apps Challenge is here to give you the opportunity to make a difference
in your community and around the world. By working together with
similarly concerned citizens from across the globe you can make a
difference. Here are just a few ways you can participate and help make
this event successful.

**Register for a location, and tell everyone that you're participating.  
**Sing up to attend one of our [locations][] near you, or choose to join
our largest location as a virtual participant. Registration is free and
open to anyone  who is willing to share their skills and perspective
with other teams around the world. It is very important to register
within the [website][locations] in order to be considered for global
judging. Share this opportunity with your peers before and during the
event. We cannot do this alone; enlist anyone with a passion. We
currently have 5,646 registered participants  and growing!

**Pick a challenge.  
**Having the freedom to choose your own project out of our 50
[challenges][] can be overwhelming. Picking and attacking a challenge
that interests YOU is usually the best [starting point][]. But don’t
stop there,  start commenting your questions or ideas on our challenge
page.

**Choose a team or make a team.**  
We want you to be involved physically and virtually. Once you pick the
challenges you're most curious about, seek out teams at physical
locations, seek out teams of virtual participants, or become a floater
by working with various teams and contributing  ideas to many challenges
-whatever you feel most comfortable with. You could even start
strategizing before the event by forming your own group of colleagues,
but just remember we’re all one big team. Branching out and
communicating with all the other paticipants, physically and virtually,
is expected; thousands of people have set aside 48 hours to work with
you. The possibilities are endless!

**Find a solution in your open source environment.  
**Weare excited to see what happens when people with diverse skill sets
come together to work for a common goal. Use earth and space data to
make awesomeness aka solution(s). The solutions can range from
software/hardware to videos/art and more.  Submit your solution(s) to be
judged locally and possibly internationally.

**Carry on with the challenge even after the event!  
**International Space Apps Challenge is only the beginning. Many of the
challenges+solutions outlive the hackathon to further space exploration.
Its been done [before][] and it can be done again.

The world is waiting for April 20th.
