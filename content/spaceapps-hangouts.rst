How do you enable 7000+ people to work together over 83 hours and across
24 time zones? One of those tools is hangouts! Hangouts provide a forum
for video, voice and text collaboration between different locations, and
they will be a key piece of our Space Apps collaboration strategy. Some
hangouts will be pre-planned (like the ones you see below) - some will
happen more serendipitously as collaborations come together. Some
projects have already done introductory Hangouts to introduce their
efforts, like \ `openROV`_.  However they happen, we definitely need
your help to get the word out at your event and in your language to get
and keep everyone connected! *(We'll add additional major hangouts here
if new ones are planned going forward.) *
