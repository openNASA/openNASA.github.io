|image0|\ Welcome to "The Sp.ace". The Sp.ace is for people who are
passionate about solving extraordinary problems.  It's a space for
people who envision a more open, participatory and collaborative space
agency.   It's a space that deserves the energy and creativity of those
who inhabit it because it is adaptable, innovative and engaging.  It's a
space where challenging the normal rules of business is encouraged.
 It's a space where an electric current of innovation pulses through
every activity, meeting, and conversation.\ |image1|

Directions: The location is above the old Weightless Environment
Training Facility (WETF) in Building 29. From Building 4N, take the
sidewalk between Building 7 and Building 29. Take the sidewalk between
T585 and Building 7, then look for the staircase on the outside of
Building 29 leading to second floor door. This is the closest door next
to Building 34. You’ll find the sp.ace at the top of the staircase in
Building 29.
