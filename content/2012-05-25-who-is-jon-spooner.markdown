It was day #1 of the [International Space Apps Challenge](http://www.spaceappschallenge.org) when I met [Jon Spooner](http://twitter.com/#!/untheatre), the director of Human Space Flight Operations at the [Unlimited Space Agency](http://www.unlimited.org.uk/home/). His goal: _**hack his way into space**_. I interviewed [Jon Spooner](http://twitter.com/#!/untheatre) about his plans as well as Todd Khozein from the operations team at [SecondMuse](http://secondmuse.com/), about his impressions on the mission.



In preparation for his flight, Jon interviewed [Dr. Alex Kumar](http://vimeo.com/40773985) (research medical doctor) from the European Space Agency, [Don Thomas](http://vimeo.com/40774306) from NASA, [Tim Peake](http://vimeo.com/40775400) (Astronaut) from European Space Agency, [Loredana Bessone](http://vimeo.com/40781271) (Astronaut instructor) from the European Space Agency, [Dr. Andy Newsam](http://vimeo.com/40806590) (Astrophysicist) from Liverpool John Moores University, and [Dr. Gail Iles](http://vimeo.com/40807998) (a condensed matter physicist and astronaut instructor) at the European Space Agency.
