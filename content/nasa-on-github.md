We love open source. Open source philosophies and collaboration models
resonate deeply with NASA and [our mission][]. Beyond ideology, open
source makes it possible for citizens to directly touch their space
program in very real ways. The collective genius enabled by open source
emboldens us and helps us reach new heights, whether they be in [low
earth orbit][], at [the edges of our solar system][], or on [new
Earths][].

[As we have mentioned before][], NASA has been working on open source
for some time. To continue, encourage, and highlight open source NASA
projects, the Open Government team today is pleased to announce [NASA’s
presence on GitHub][], the web-based social code host and revision
control application. Our [first public repository][] houses NASA’s
popular World Wind Java project, an open source 3D interactive world
viewer. In addition, we are actively reaching out to other open source
software projects within NASA and encouraging them to make use of this
and similar resources. We hope that highly visible and coordinated
hosting of projects will stimulate development and awareness.

If you have an open source NASA project you would like to share, please
