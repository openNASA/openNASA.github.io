**Volunteers and Experts around the World Collaborate To Solve Global
Challenges Through Random Hacks of Kindness**

December, 2011 - - On December 3rd and 4th, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!,
NASA, HP and the World Bank, through their initiative `Random Hacks of
Kindness`_ (RHoK), will bring together thousands of people in over 25
locations around the globe to “hack for humanity.” Random Hacks of
Kindness is a community of innovation that brings together subject
matter experts with volunteer technologists to develop open technology
solutions to the global challenges.

During past RHoK events around the world, volunteers have worked on
applications that are already making an impact. `Bushfire Connect`_, a
crowd-sourced mapping tool to report bushfires, is being used by local
communities across Australia. The Philadelphia Food Trust is promoting
`PhillySNAP`_, a mobile application connecting recipients of food stamps
to sources of fresh produce. The World Bank is piloting `CHASM`_,
software for visualizing landslide risk, in the Caribbean. The
Government of Colombia has adopted `ATAOLI`_, a shelter management
system built at RHoK Bogota, to manage millions of people displaced
annually by winter storms. Other apps have received support and interest
from governments, NGOs and international organizations around the world.
