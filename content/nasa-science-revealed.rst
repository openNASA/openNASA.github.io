NASA released a new iPad app called the NASA Visualization Explorer
which is "the coolest way to get stories about NASA's space-based Earth
science research". The NASA Visualization Explorer relies on computer
images built from satellite data for most of its pictures. Topics
include climate change, aerosols, glaciers, hurricanes, volcanoes and
wildfires; all things observed by NASA satellites.
