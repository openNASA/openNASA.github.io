What are YOU doing to celebrate [World Space Week][]?

Declared by the United Nations General Assembly in 1999, and celebrated
by hundreds of space agencies, aerospace companies, schools, planetaria,
and museums, World Space Week is the largest annual space event in the
world. World Space Week builds the workforce of tomorrow by inspiring
students, demonstrates visible public support for the space program,
educates the public about space activities, and fosters international
cooperation into space outreach and education. Since 2007, more than 94
nations have participated in more than 2,250 events with more than 1.3
million attendees.

Why October 4-10 every year? These dates were chosen to commemorate two
significant events in space history. On October 4, 1957 [Sputnik
I ][]became the first human-made satellite to be launched into outer
space. On October 10, 1967 the United Nations *[Treaty on Principles
Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Peaceful Uses
of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies][]* went
into effect.

The 2011 theme for World Space Week is [50 Years of Human
Spaceflight][]. The first human spaceflight took place on April 12,
1961, when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made one orbit around the Earth aboard
the Vostok 1 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet space program and
designed by the rocket scientist Sergey Korolyov. Since then, 3
sovereign nations have launched humans into space, with many more
partnering and participating. Talk about space history! What's going to
happen next? How are you going to be a part of it?
