We're excited today to announce the launch of our `Data API`_ for
`data.nasa.gov`_, the collaborative online database of NASA datasets we
`launched`_ in August. The data.nasa.gov API allows a machine-readable
interface to return metadata from the site organized by category, tag,
date, or search term. We're hoping this allows new and creative
visualizations of the data resources NASA provides to the public.
Additionally, it is a learning experience for us as we work to expand
transparency, participation, and collaboration at NASA through new uses
of technology.

You can view documentation on the API directly on
`data.nasa.gov <http://data.nasa.gov/api-info>`__. As this (like all of
our project) is a continual work-in-progress, we would love your
feedback on the tool and your ideas on how you would improve access to
NASA's public data.
