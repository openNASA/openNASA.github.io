The Sp.ace is a open collaboratory and workspace at Johnson Space Center focused on creating participatory environment that invites innovation and challenging the normal rules of business. Since opening in February 2011, the Sp.ace has provided coworking space for a variety of projects, including Engineers Without Borders, OpenGov, and the NASA FIRST participants.

The Open Government team hopes that the Sp.ace will serve as a role model for potential collabortorium projects across the agency, enabling flexible workspace for short-term team projects, brainstorming sessions, or a place to simply escape from the traditional office environment to focus on thinking "outside the box".
