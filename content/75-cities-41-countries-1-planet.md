*What could be possible when citizens in 75 cities and 41 countries come
together to work on more than 50 specially curated challenges?* We will
explore new ideas, perspectives and technologies. We will use data to
build solutions to address real challenges. We will work together,
harnessing the capacity and experience of a diverse group of global
citizens to help make a better planet to live in on well as a better
future for living off-planet. **All in 48 hours. **
