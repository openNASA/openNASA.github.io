We're excited today to announce the launch of our [Data API](http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/) for [data.nasa.gov](http://data.nasa.gov), the collaborative online database of NASA datasets we [launched](https://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/30/introducing-data-nasa-gov/) in August. The data.nasa.gov API allows a machine-readable interface to return metadata from the site organized by category, tag, date, or search term. We're hoping this allows new and creative visualizations of the data resources NASA provides to the public. Additionally, it is a learning experience for us as we work to expand transparency, participation, and collaboration at NASA through new uses of technology.

You can view documentation on the API directly on [data.nasa.gov](http://data.nasa.gov/api-info). As this (like all of our project) is a continual work-in-progress, we would love your feedback on the tool and your ideas on how you would improve access to NASA's public data.
