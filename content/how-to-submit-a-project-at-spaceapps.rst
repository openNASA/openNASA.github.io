Whether you're a scientist, a software developer, an educator, a
student, a maker, or just a space geek, we hope you enjoy building
innovative solutions at this year's International Space Apps Challenge. 
Collaboration - both locally and globaly - is the core of this event. 
Ask for help, take risks, and try something new!

#. To enter a project you need a name, a description, and a license that
   you release the work under, so be prepared for that.
#. Once you enter a project, you can come back and edit it as often as
   you like.
#. Make sure ALL of your teammates get entered in. This is important in
   the cases when awards are given, or folks are otherwise recognized.

Now get this "paperwork" done and go back to the fun stuff -- but
remember: if you don't enter it as a project, it didn't happen at Space
Apps!!
