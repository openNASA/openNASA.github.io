NASA’s OpenGov Office supported and actively participated at November’s
Science Hack Day in Palo Alto, CA, where scientists, engineers,
developers, and designers came together to complete a variety of
projects, ranging from a Android phone controlled rover to an GPS
carrying balloon that could be used to quickly map a wide area. Through
their involvement, the NASA team gained valuable feedback on how to best
interact with Citizen Scientists to provide them with the tools and data
they need to succeed.

The team is now planning a similar event to hold in Texas later this
year. The event will be coordinated with Space Life Sciences and is
meant to engage “makers” - an emerging class of hackers who blur the
line between raw science data and the physical world with an interest in
bringing science and technology together.  Scientists, engineers,
developers and designers will be invited and encouraged to join teams to
develop, solder, construct, assemble and present projects related to
life sciences and NASA data.  The event will provide the NASA’s Open
Government team another opportunity to make NASA data more available and
accessible.
