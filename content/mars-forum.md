NASA is currently charting a new agency-wide strategy for the future of
Mars exploration, both robotic and human.  Involvement from the science
& technical community and all interested members of the general public
is essential to this process.

Today, NASA’s Mars Program Planning Group (MPPG) is opening up a new
opportunity for the public to pose questions and participate in the
discussion regarding plans for the future of Mars exploration.  We need
your help to get the word out about the Mars Forum:

<http://mars.ideascale.com>

This online community, open from today through July 1, 2012, allows the
scientific & technical community and all interested members of the
general public to:

\* **Ask**(today-July 1): Pose questions, offer answers, and vote on the
most important user-generated content related to the [Mars program
planning effort][];  
\* **Discuss**(June 12-14): Comment online and tune in to the [Concepts
and Approaches for Mars Exploration Workshop][], via Live Stream; and  
\* **Contribute**(post-workshop through July 1): Use the forum to
discuss ideas addressing the challenges posed at the workshop, and share
your knowledge of the challenges and opportunities of Mars exploration.

**It's time to make plans. **
