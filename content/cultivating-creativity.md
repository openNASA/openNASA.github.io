*"Our future depends on innovators who can bring together diverse
talents and perspectives to imagine and implement new solutions and
ventures."*

In preparation for the [International Space Apps Challenge][], NASA was
invited to lead a Salon at [Vanderbilt University][] as part of the
[Curb Creative Enterprise and Public Leadership Scholars Program][]. The
Curb Center Leadership Salons provide some of Vanderbilt's [brightest
students][] the chance to engage in informal conversations and hands-on
workshops with leaders from across the creative spectrum. Some of their
[previous guests][] include the co-creators of Guitar Hero and Rock
Band, to fashion designers and entrepreneurs. Given that the
[International Space Apps Challenge][] is one of the most creative
undertakings the Agency has ever attempted, the invitation seemed
appropriate!

The [NASA Open Government Initiative][] in general, and the
[International Space Apps Challenge][], in particular, are activities
that value creativity and require "outside-the-box" thinking.  The idea
of a Salon incentives students to apply the use of a creative process in
order to develop innovation solutions to tough challenges. The approach
is much more engaging then a lecture about a topic and challenges the
students to develop creative solutions to real problems facing real
organizations.  The Curb Center is all about understanding and applying
the creative process. Through creative practice workshops, the Curb
Scholars experiment and gain experience in the creative process and
problem solving—brainstorming, improvising, storytelling, asking
provocative questions, synthesizing ideas, using humor, recombining
materials and ideas, diagnosing problems, prototyping, and pitching
their innovations.

As predicted, the process *works*.  When presented with a sub-set of the
[60 challenges][] posted on the [International Space Apps
Challenge][]website, the students came up with some very impressive
solutions. The ideas and feedback generated by the students in just a
matter of hours were so good that we used them to refine and improve the
challenges for the event. To give you an example of what the solutions
looked like, one team took the approach to develop a challenge by NASA
for schools across the nation to "[Visualize the All-too-Common
Astronomy/Solar System Misconceptions][]."

> *Wouldn’t you like to party it up with an astronaut at your school?!?
> Visit NASA’s “How Well do You Know our Solar System?” page to enter
> your school in our national competition. We have listed dozens of
> misconceptions that exist about our universe and we would like you to
> solve them. Help educate others with a 1 minute music video/jingle
> that spreads the truth about the solar system! Next, upload your
> videos onto our page. You will compete with hundreds of other classes
> around the world for a chance to meet an astronaut. The class with the
> best jingle will be rewarded with an all day visit from a real
> astronaut! If your video is chosen, it will also be featured on
> television!*
>
> *Not interested in creating a video but still want to be involved?
> Purchase your own space buddy that have been modeled after actual
> astronauts! Each stuffed doll comes with a URL that allows you to
> access your own universe. You will be able to play interactive games
> and build your own world! See what happens if the Earth does get
> bigger than the Sun! If the Sun did disappear at night! Each item
> purchased will provide funds for an impoverished child to learn more
> about the solar system by providing them with a scholarship to attend
> a NASA space camp!*

**So why does creativity matter?**

In an [article][] posted on the Curb Center's website by [Steven
Tepper][]and George D. Kuh called “*Let’s Get Serious About Cultivating
Creativity*,” the authors explains that "*To fuel the 21st-century
economic engine and sustain democratic values, we must unleash and
nurture the creative impulse that exists within every one of us, or so
say experts like Richard Florida, Ken Robinson, Daniel Pink, Keith
Sawyer, and Tom Friedman. Indeed, just as the advantages the United
States enjoyed in the past were based in large part on scientific and
engineering advances, today it is cognitive flexibility, inventiveness,
design thinking, and nonroutine approaches to messy problems that are
essential to adapt to rapidly changing and unpredictable global forces;
to create new markets; to take risks and start new enterprises; and to
produce compelling forms of media, entertainment, and design.*"

As we get ready for the [International Space Apps Challenge][] and start
to think about the solutions we plan to develop around one of the many
challenges this weekend, I really encourage you to consider your
creative approach. Are you thinking about the problem in a traditional
way or are you really stretching yourself creatively? What are
the decisions, practices, regulations, and laws that you are letting
nurture or constrain your creative work?

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Please</span> use this event
as an opportunity to experiment - *to learn* - to try something
different. Being creative may feel like a risk, but it's one that is
well worth it.  You may be surprised with the results!
