The `International Space Apps Challenge`_ is an international mass
collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over
48-hours in cities `around the world`_. The event embraces collaborative
problem solving with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions.
Today, we are announcing the challenges for this years event!  The
challenges are focused on improving life on Earth and life in space in
the areas of open source software, open hardware, data visualization and
citizen science. As we get closer to the event expect more detail, data
resources, and content to help you in your work. You can find out more
about all the challenges at http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges
