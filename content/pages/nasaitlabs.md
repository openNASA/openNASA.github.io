  Initiated in May 2011, IT Labs is a NASA agency-wide program of the Chief Technology Officer for Information Technology (CTO-IT) within the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). IT Labs strives to identify and seize opportunities to make progress quickly and affordably, identify and manage risks, learn fast and adapt plans to take next steps. The best IT-related ideas are solicited from within NASA to fund incrementally for research and development with the goal of making NASA IT the best it can be. In two years of existence, IT Labs has already garnered two Federal accolades for Innovation and IT.   [![NASA\_CIO graphic.jpg][]][]

| completes one of three (3) phases:   |                                      |
| Idea/Issue, Proof of Concept, or     |                                      |

<a name="x-Our Vision"></a><a name="x-Government Uses"></a>Our Vision {#toc1}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

*IT Labs will engage the brightest minds across the Agency to guide
NASA's IT strategy and investment decisions, and identify IT
capabilities that can best support NASA’s needs in a rapidly changing
world.*

<a name="x-Our Mission"></a><a name="x-Government Uses"></a>Our Mission {#toc2}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Technology is constantly evolving, and we must adapt to keep the pace.
IT Labs represents a significant leap from how NASA traditionally
evaluates new technologies. Often, innovative projects are either
burdened by multiple layers of documentation, evaluation, and approvals
or conducted separately, often in multiple NASA centers to fulfill
business needs.*  
*Our program provides a central collection point for innovative ideas,
as well as a lightweight, low-cost methodology for research,
proofs-of-concept and prototypes. The IT Labs process for project
evaluation allows for projects to be quickly and effectively evaluated
based on essential criteria identified by the program, at defined points
in the project’s life cycle. This evaluation of quality and potential
viability mitigates risk factors of both time and cost, effectively
providing a better chance for more projects to be realized.*

-   NASA is running a pilot phase with Google Apps as of March 2013 with
    the intent to roll out as an Enterprise Service in the Summer of
    2013.

-   An IT Labs-funded project is now producing a plug-and-play modular
    approach to test automation. The IEEE Standards Association project
    1877 will define a web/XML Test Orchestration Interface that will
    enable discovery of modular assets, the summary control and status
    data and metadata, and behaviors, requirements, hardware interfaces,
    and other descriptive information in a standardized
    machine-interpretable information format. Called mREST, the
    interface combines plug-and-play and web services protocols with
    Automatic Test Markup Language (ATML). ATML is an IEEE information
    framework standard.

-   Numerous other projects are in work under the themes of: Big Data,
    Cloud Computing, Mobility, Gaming Tech, Searching, Knowledge
    Management, etc.

IT Labs is interested in partnering across federal agencies, academic
institutions, and industry to collaborate and explore great ideas. IT
Labs is integrated into the network of Chief Technology Officers at each
of NASA's Field Centers including NASA Headquarters and is also
networked with [NASA Open Gov Initiative][], [Data.Gov][], and
NASA's [Center of Excellence and Collaborative Innovation][] (CoECI)
which hones in numerous innovation platforms used by NASA.

Outside of NASA, IT Labs is networked with the Human and Health Services
(HHS) program [Ignite (beta)][] and the General Services Administration
(GSA) Digital Services Innovation Center as well as the collaboration
network of government, industry, academia, and non-profits, [NASA Human
Health and Performance Center][] (NHHPC). For more innovation programs
highlighted in this wiki site, see [challenge.gov][].

The work completed for the 2011 Fiscal Year and the work that received
funding for the FY 2012 period is found in the [FY 2011-2012 IT Labs
Annual Report][]. An annual report for FY 2012-2013 is currently in
work. NASA Open Gov Initiative hosts a page with more information on
an [external IT Labs page][]. With NASA credentials, one can see the IT
Labs internal site at [https://labs.nasa.gov][] but efforts are in work
to create more external transparency with a more dynamic web site.  
Currently, in IT Labs' short life since May 2011, two (2) accolades
have been earned from external entities.
