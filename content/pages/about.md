NASA is expanding transparency, participation, and collaboration and
creating a new level of openness and accountability. We are focusing on
embedding open government into three integrated aspects of our
operations—policy, technology, and culture. Whether NASA is using social
networks to allow students to interact directly with astronauts, or
creating a Cloud Computing Platform to give unprecedented access to
scientific data, we have embraced the Open Government Directive.

**About open.nasa.gov**

open.nasa.gov is a collaborative platform for the open government
community to share success stories and projects they are working on.
 The content on this site is written by NASA employees and contractors
across the agency. We are excited to highlight the ways that
transparency, participation, and collaboration are being embraced by
NASA policy, technology, and culture – and the amazing future that
becomes possible because of that commitment.

**Highlights from NASA's Open Government Plan**

NASA’s founding legislation in 1958 instructed NASA to “…provide for the
widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information…” The
principles of open government have been embedded in our operations for
50+ years. We recognize that open government is a process rather than a
product, and have taken a continuous-learning approach.

We believe that integrating Open Government Principles into existing
systems (e.g., governance councils and performance management system)
provides the best framework for success. Throughout the plan we
establish a solid foundation for institutional change based on the five
NASA Open Government principles:

1.  Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external
    stakeholders.
2.  Enable citizen participation in NASA’s mission.
3.  Improve internal NASA collaboration and innovation.
4.  Encourage partnerships than can create economic opportunity.
5.  Institutionalize Open Government philosophies and practices at NASA.

NASA’s Open Government activities span 22 identified Agency projects
across the centers, and 3 flagship initiatives will take the Initiative
to a new level:

-   **Policy**: NASA is working to make open source software development
    more collaborative at NASA to benefit both the Agency and the
    public.
-   **Technology**: NASA Nebula, as the government's first open-source
    cloud computing platform, offers an easier way for NASA scientists
    and researchers to share large, complex data sets with external
    partners and the public.
-   **Culture**: The creation of a new NASA Participatory Exploration
    Office will infuse more public participation into NASA’s mission.
