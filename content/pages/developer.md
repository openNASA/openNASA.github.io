To truly accomplish the immense task NASA has been given, we are working
to develop new ways to enlist citizens around the globe to contribute
their time, talent, and creativity to help us solve the grand challenges
of our time. This is especially true in times of shrinking budgets,
constrained resources, and increasing demands for a more open and
transparent government. The key principles of openness—participation,
collaboration and transparency—have been embedded in NASA operations for
more than 50 years, but new applications are becoming possible all the
time in this digital age.

As NASA continues to implement the Open Government Directive, the
Digital Government Strategy, and the Open Data mandate, we are committed
to promoting the innovative application of our data in the public and
private sectors by providing engagement opportunities and tools for
citizen developers.

We need your help! We have created this page for developers who are
interested in using NASA data and code to build new technology and
re-think how our most valuable assets from our space exploration and
aeronautics mission can be used and remixed to improve life on Earth and
life in space.

*What will you create?*

### **code.NASA**

[Code.nasa.gov][] expands NASA’s open source activities, surfaces
existing activities, and guides internal and external groups in open
development, release, and contribution. In doing so, NASA hopes to lower
barriers to building open technology in partnership with the public.
Future plans for code.nasa.gov include closer integration with our
GitHub presence (<http://github.com/nasa>), as well as improved catalogs
of our available APIs and software release processes. If you are a
developer employed by NASA or a NASA contractor and have open source
code you wish to host on the NASA GitHub repository, email us at
opensource@lists.nasa.gov. If you aren't affiliated with NASA, we
encourage your to clone, fork, modify, break, and improve the code that
we've released thus far.

### **data.NASA**

[Data.nasa.gov][]is NASA’s flagship platform for sharing information
about the vast data we collect and store—over 100 years of U.S.
aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists, entrepreneurs,
citizen scientists, and many others can contribute directly to the
exploration of space and Earth by helping to create new ways of looking
at this data. The Agency continues to work to improve accessibility to
this data and is actively incentivizing the use of government data by
citizens. To address the ever-increasing amount of tools and data
catalogs that are publicly available on NASA’s many websites, this
directory lists publicly available datasets and serves to streamline the
process for posting these datasets on data.gov. The directory includes
information and direct links to more than 1,000 datasets.

### **APIs**

Over the past 50 years, NASA has collected a vast amount of data that
has helped us better understand Earth, other planets in our solar
system, and the depths of space. Almost all of of this data is now in
the public domain—petabytes upon petabytes waiting for you to
explore. Although the Agency offers petabytes of publicly available data
to the world from a variety of missions, only a small portion is
accessible through API interfaces. NASA sees huge promise in web APIs,
as they can enhance our ability to deliver data to both established and
new audiences. The Digital Strategy mandate directed NASA to use web
APIs to make available high-value data and content for at least two
existing major customer-facing systems. Examples of NASA-produced APIs
include:

> **NASA Data API**
>
> The data.nasa.gov API allows a machine-readable interface to return
> metadata from the site organized by category, tag, date, or search
> term. We’re hoping this allows new and creative visualizations of the
> data resources NASA provides to the public. Additionally, it is a
> learning experience for us as we work to expand transparency,
> participation, and collaboration at NASA through new uses of
> technology.
>
> <http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/>
>
> **Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearing House (ECHO)**
>
> The NASA-developed Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearinghouse (ECHO)
> is a spatial and temporal metadata registry and order broker built by
> NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) that enables
> the science community to more easily use and exchange NASA's data and
> services. ECHO's main objective is to enable broader use of NASA's EOS
> data. It allows users to more efficiently search and access data and
> services, and increases the potential for interoperability with new
> tools and services. The value of these resources increases with the
> potential to exchange and interoperate. ECHO has been working with
> other organizations to provide their Earth science metadata alongside
> NASA's for users to search and access. ECHO stores metadata from a
> variety of science disciplines and domains, including Climate
> Variability and Change, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Earth Surface and
> Interior, Atmospheric Composition, Weather, and Water and Energy
> Cycle.

> <http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/>
>
> **Heliocentric Trajectories Web Services**
>
> An API offering heliocentric trajectories for selected spacecraft,
> planets, and comets.
>
> <http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/>
>
> **Satellite Situation Center API**
>
> The Satellite Situation Center (SSC) web services allow a software
> developer to use portions of the SSC software in their own
> applications. SSC is a system to cast geocentric spacecraft location
> information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions and
> mappings of spacecraft locations along lines of the Earth's magnetic
> field. This capability is one key to mission science planning (both
> single missions and coordinated observations of multiple spacecraft
> with ground-based investigations) and to subsequent multi-mission data
> analysis.
>
> <http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/>
>
> **Coordinated Data Analysis System (CDAS) Web services**
>
> The Coordinated Data Analysis System (CDAS) web services allow a
> software developer to use CDAS services in their own applications.
> CDAS supports simultaneous multi-mission, multi-instrument selection
> and comparison of science data among a wide range of current space
> missions. While CDAWeb provides access to this data through an
> HTML-based user interface, these web services provides a (web)
> application programming interface (API) to CDAS. If you are developing
> an application that requires science data from any CDAS-held datasets,
> then the CDAS web services will provide an interface to the data for
> your application.

With constrained budgetary resources and the large, complex, and legacy
systems our data is housed in, however, relying solely on NASA data
owners to release APIs is not the best approach to opening our data to
the world. Thus, our strategy has been to launch a series of challenges
and collaboration opportunities to enable citizen developers around the
world to help us in our quest to further the transparency and
accessibility of NASA data systems. Events like the International Space
Apps Challenge create opportunities for thousands of citizen developers
from across the planet to contribute their time, and help the agency
create front-end APIs for many of our legacy data systems.

NASA has hosted two [International Space Apps Challenge][] events - the
first in April 2012 and the second in April 2013. In the 2013 event,
over 9,100 participants at over 83 cities around the world created 770
unique, open source solutions for a series of challenges the agency
issued. The challenges varied in scope and subject, from creating data
visualizations to designing more efficient air traffic control systems
to creating new API interfaces for legacy datasets. With relatively
little investment from the Agency, dozens of unique APIs were born out
of the initiative, many of which are listed below. Going forward, NASA
hopes to hold more events like the International Space Apps Challenge in
collaboration with our own internal efforts. In adopting these APIs, we
can harness the power of citizen collaboration to assist us in reaching
our goals.
