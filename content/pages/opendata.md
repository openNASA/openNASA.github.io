NASA has a long history of placing large amounts of data online for
members of the public to use. Recently, on January 22, 2010, we provided
three new datasets and 18 other tools, widgets and catalogs to Data.gov.
Of the 18 new widgets and catalogs, three of which stand out as chosen
descriptive tools indicative of NASA's products:

-   **NASA World Wind** is a web service and open source project with
    nightly builds which allows people to zoom from satellite altitude
    into any place on Earth, leveraging satellite imagery and mission
    data, and thus experience Earth terrain in visually rich 3D. NASA
    World Wind Java is also a plug in to allow third party users to
    customize their own information through the World Wind Java widget;
-   **Global Change Master Directory** is an integrated platform with
    continuously updated information about the planet's vital signs,
    including the rising global temperature, size of the ozone hole, the
    rising sea level, and the amount of carbon dioxide in the
    atmosphere;
-   The **Planetary Data System** is an archive of data products from
    NASA planetary missions, and it has become a basic resource for
    scientists around the world.

The three new datasets provided to the "raw" data catalog are available
in a machine readable format and updated as new data is received from
NASA's spacecraft:

-   **On Earth** is the most current, near-global image of the earth
    available, updated each day in a KML format. Taken from the MODIS
    instrument on the Terra and Aqua spacecraft, this data will improve
    our understanding of global dynamics and processes occurring on the
    land, in the oceans, and in the lower atmosphere. MODIS is playing a
    vital role in the development of validated, global, interactive
    Earth system models able to predict global change accurately enough
    to assist policy makers in making sound decisions concerning the
    protection of our environment;
-   **Tropical Surface Current Velocity** is a dataset of estimates of
    the horizontal near-surface currents of the Tropical Pacific ocean.
    The near-surface velocity is directly derived from sea surface
    height, wind velocity and sea surface temperature. This data
    provides an unfiltered velocity field, on a 1deg X 1deg grid with a
    5day resolution;
-   **Land Surface Temperature at Night** is a global map which shows
    the temperature of Earth's lands during the nighttime. Taken with
    the MODIS instrument on the Terra and Aqua satellites and aggregated
    into monthly datasets in a KML format, this temperature dataset is a
    measure of how warm or cold Earth's lands are at night. This dataset
    is useful for understanding where it is too hot or too cold for food
    crops to prosper, and general influences on weather or climate
    patters.

NASA has provided public insight into its operations for many years,
from publishing its employee directory online to providing human capital
information query-able in many ways. Since NASA's inception, we have
publicly archived all of its data received from spacecraft projects,
including over 4TB of new Earth Science data each day. There are tools
and geodata catalogs available to allow scientists and the public to
access NASA's raw data. When accessed through these Distributed Active
Archive Centers (DAACs), tools and catalogs, the user gets more value
out of the aggregated data than it would alone. NASA is committed to
receiving public and employee ideas for additional high-value datasets,
particularly datasets from the institutional and procedural realms of
NASA activities and providing new datasets to the raw data catalog on
data.gov giving greater insight into the inner workings of the U.S.
space program.
