### Background

This 27' long Airstream began its career at NASA in 1989 as the Shuttle
Modal Inspection System. After the Space Shuttle Program ended the
trailer became excess and was available for other uses.

At NASA Johnson Space Center, the Center Operations Directorate has set
a goal to expand the use of the outdoor mall area and take full
advantage of the beauty and serenity of the ponds, trees and wildlife.
We decided to conduct a low-cost experiment with the Airstream and
create an outdoor meeting and gathering area for employees in the center
of the mall.

### **Project** **Sputnik**

The Center Operations Directorate has turned the historic Airstream into
a collaborative meeting area, code-named "Sputnik".  The project pays
homage to the past while linking to our future. The Airstreams' unique
silver exterior invokes the same creative flair seen in the world's
first satellite. Sputnik launched from the same pad that now carriers
our astronauts to the International Space Station.

Sputnik's features include:

-   Sustainable power in the form of a solar generator and LED light
    fixtures
-   An outdoor sitting area for casual meetings
-   An indoor meeting area for small groups
-   Whiteboards and large post-it-note paper
-   A small table for private work
-   The Airlock - a two person "back porch" complete with a raisable
    hatch to enjoy the full view of the natural outdoors

### **Explore!**

We invite you to meet, eat, drink a little coffee, create or enjoy the
area in any way you wish. Planned activities include luncheon "AMA (Ask
Me Anything)" informal sessions with members of senior staff and perhaps
even Acoustic Thursdays featuring lunchtime music from some of JSC's
home grown artists. Feel free to suggest other planned activities as you
wish.

The Sputnik experiment will run through the winter (our best time of the
year!) and will be evaluated in the Spring to see how well it worked and
whether it will be relocated to a different area or purpose.

### **How We Did It**

The Sputnik conversion from mobile lab to meeting area was accomplished
through volunteered efforts of JA employees, from sewing cushions, to
painting cabinets, to stenciling designs. Many thanks to all of the
volunteers that made this experiment possible.
