-----------------------

August 4-5, 2011
----------------

NASA Forward Maker Camp is an effort at engaging the work force in fast,
hyper local projects that advance NASA’s mission and vision. Based on
the “Maker” culture, the concept is to gather interested individuals and
go about making something new. Several centers have already conducted
their Maker Camps, focusing on 2 to 3 activities ranging from physical
creations to process improvements.

On August 4-5, Ames Research Center and Johnson Space Center will join
forces to create a cross-cultural event focusing on engaging our student
populations on a few relevant projects. It is hoped that the student
themselves will have concepts for bettering NASA that they would like to
explore with their peers locally and remotely. There will also be a
number of “seed” concepts or projects where students can contribute
their perspectives and talents.

Please see below for locations, connection details, and frequently asked
questions.
