There was an [op-ed piece published in The NY Times on 23 October 2011
written by Joel E. Cohen][], a mathematical biologist who heads the
Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University and Columbia
University, titled, “Seven Billion.”  Sandy Leeds, a finance professor
at the University of Texas, summarized some key facts, [in his blog post
on November 6th][]:

> -   The UN estimates that our world population reached seven billion
>     at the end of October.
> -   Our world population has doubled in the past 50 years. We had
>     three billion in 1959, four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987
>     and six billion in 1998.
> -   The UN anticipates 8 billion people by 2025, 9 billion by 2043 and
>     10 billion by 2083. India will have more people than China shortly
>     after 2020. Before 2040, sub-Saharan Africa will have more people
>     than India.
> -   In 1950, there were nearly three times as many Europeans as
>     sub-Saharan Africans. By 2010, there were 16% more sub-Saharan
>     Africans than Europeans. By 2100, there will be nearly five
>     sub-Saharan Africans for every European.
> -   Life expectancy is now 70. The average number of children per
>     woman fell worldwide to 2.5. It was five in 1950. The world’s
>     population is growing at 1.1% per year, half the peak rate in the
>     1960s.
> -   In 1950, for each person 65 and older, there were more than six
>     children under 15. By 2070, elderly people will outnumber children
>     under 15 and there will be only three people of working age (15 to
>     64) for every two people under 15 or 65 and older. We will have
>     intense pressure to extend the working age beyond 65.
> -   Nearly half the world lives on \$2 per day or less. In China, the
>     figure is 36%; in India it’s 76%.
> -   Approximately 850 million to 925 million people experience food
>     insecurity or chronic undernourishment. In much of Africa and
>     South Asia, more than half the children are stunted (low height
>     for their age) as a result of chronic hunger.
> -   The world produced 2.3 billion metric tons of cereal grains in
>     2009-10. This is enough calories to sustain nine to eleven billion
>     people. BUT…only 46% of the grain went into human mouths. Domestic
>     animals got 34% of the crop and 19% went to industrial uses like
>     biofuels, starches and plastics.
> -   Human demands on the earth have grown enormously. (Unfortunately,
>     the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents have stayed the same
>     size.) Already, more than a billion people live without an
>     adequate, renewable supply of fresh water.
> -   About two-thirds of fresh water is used for agriculture.
> -   We’re going to see huge shifts in the geopolitical balance of
>     numbers, further declines in the number of children per woman,
>     smaller but more numerous households, an increasingly elderly
>     population, and growing and more numerous cities.
> -   Growth in households can be even more important than pure
>     population growth. Each household has energy demands.

The stats are thought-provoking and really help provide the context for
the future of our world. But, sometimes reading the numbers isn’t
enough. That’s why I wanted to share this great youtube video
infographic created by [NPR][] that helps visualize the numbers in a
really creative way.

*It was just over two centuries ago that the global population was 1
billion — in 1804. But better medicine and improved agriculture resulted
in higher life expectancy for children, dramatically increasing the
world population, especially in the West.*

*As higher standards of living and better health care are reaching more
parts of the world, the rates of fertility — and population growth —
have started to slow down, though the population will continue to grow
for the foreseeable future.*

*U.N. forecasts suggest the world population could hit a peak of 10.1
billion by 2100 before beginning to decline. But exact numbers are hard
to come by — just small variations in fertility rates could mean a
population of 15 billion by the end of the century.*
