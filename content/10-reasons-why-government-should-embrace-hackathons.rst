Recently `NYC’s Chief Digital Officer Rachel Sterne`_ wrote an article
about why cities (but really any level of government) should embrace the
code-a-thon. We couldn’t agree more, so we wanted to post her list
(slightly modified to include all government, not just NYC) on open.NASA
and take this opportunity to encourage you to let you know about two
upcoming NASA sponsored / supported code-a-thon events:

-  Waterhackathon, Fall 2011, \ http://www.waterhackathon.org/
-  Random Hacks of Kindness, December 3-4, 2011,\ `http://www.rhok.org`_

Additionally, we hear that another `Science Hack Day is currently being
planned for November 12-13th`_ in San Francisco!
