What are YOU doing to celebrate [World Space Week](http://www.worldspaceweek.org/)?

Declared by the United Nations General Assembly in 1999, and celebrated by hundreds of space agencies, aerospace companies, schools, planetaria, and museums, World Space Week is the largest annual space event in the world. World Space Week builds the workforce of tomorrow by inspiring students, demonstrates visible public support for the space program, educates the public about space activities, and fosters international cooperation into space outreach and education. Since 2007, more than 94 nations have participated in more than 2,250 events with more than 1.3 million attendees.

Why October 4-10 every year? These dates were chosen to commemorate two significant events in space history. On October 4, 1957 [Sputnik I ](http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/)became the first human-made satellite to be launched into outer space. On October 10, 1967 the United Nations _[Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies](http://history.nasa.gov/1967treaty.html)_ went into effect.

The 2011 theme for World Space Week is [50 Years of Human Spaceflight](http://www.worldspaceweek.org/theme.html). The first human spaceflight took place on April 12, 1961, when cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin made one orbit around the Earth aboard the Vostok 1 spacecraft, launched by the Soviet space program and designed by the rocket scientist Sergey Korolyov. Since then, 3 sovereign nations have launched humans into space, with many more partnering and participating. Talk about space history! What's going to happen next? How are you going to be a part of it?
