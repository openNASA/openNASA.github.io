The `International Space Apps Challenge`_, held on 21-22 April 2012, was
a very productive event.\ `100+ solutions`_ were developed in less than
48 hours, and although a few teams are still submitting their solutions
to the website, we wanted to provide a summary of the 100+ reasons what
you did at the event made a difference! We have listed out all unique
solutions submitted below, in alphabetical order, and included a one or
two sentence elevator-pitch description of each. We have also included a
link to the solution page if you are interested in finding out more
information about the solution, want to view or download the code, share
a comment, contact the team, or in some cases view a demo or prototype
of the solution itself. If you are one of the participants and would
like to improve the description we have for your project, please email
us your updates at `coreteam@spaceappschallenge.org`_.
