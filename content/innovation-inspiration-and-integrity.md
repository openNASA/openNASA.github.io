[NASA Chief Scientist Waleed Abdalati][] reminded me so eloquently
yesterday about what is so powerful about what we do here at NASA.

> The iconic success of NASA is planted firmly on three foundational
> elements: innovation, inspiration, and integrity. While innovation and
> inspiration are visible through our endeavors and successes, *it is
> our integrity – how we work, and our commitment to excellence and
> openness – that earns us the trust of the public and ensures our
> continued ability to inspire and innovate.*  Integrity is woven
> throughout the fabric of NASA.  It has always been there. And each and
> every day, we recommit ourselves to keeping it there.

(You can read more about the Agency's framework for scientific
integrity [here][].)

**Innovation** is what NASA is known for. Every day we are asking new
questions and solving problems in new ways. We are [encouraging
innovation internally][] and building [innovative communities
externally][], incubating technologies that are [deeply committed to
making a better world][]. We are developing [innovative partnerships][]
all the time to encourage cross-pollination of research and ideas.

Almost all of us have wondered about life beyond Earth or dreamt of
flying in space at some point in our lives;**inspiration** is the part
that seems to come so easily. Who isn't inspired by [this][]? Or
[this][1]? Or [this][2]? NASA gives us [perspective on our planet][] -
and on [what it means to be human][] - every single day. Every time I
watch brave explorers suit up and climb onto a rocket to go to space,
like I did [just this week][], I get excited again about what is and can
be possible.

**Integrity**, however, is the commitment we make every single day.
Integrity is doing the hard work of putting things into the light -
documenting ideas, insuring safety, working through processes, truly
engaging citizens. It's what allows crewmembers to ["strap themselves to
a few million pounds of explosives and trusting that everything will
work as planned."][] Sometimes it means [asking hard questions about our
own issues][]. Integrity is insuring that not just the crew but the
*public* can trust what is behind the decisions we are making - and
committing to appropriately share that information with them. The
[National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958][], as amended, stipulates
that NASA shall “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof.” And as the policy notes: *unless a determination is made that
public dissemination of  information must be prohibited or restricted,
NASA information is made available to the public*. ([NPR 2200.2, Section
4.5.1][])

I fully believe that this is why [openness][] is so important at NASA as
we stay focused on such an important [mission][]. As Dr. Abdalati notes,
our "awareness of the freedoms and responsibilities [that integrity
requires] will help us continue to pursue new knowledge, fuel wonder,
and make groundbreaking discoveries about the universe and our place in
it." It is also why we continue to [engage citizens][], pressing forward
with [open source policy development][], building an effective [platform
for open data][], accelerating [effective technologies][], and
strengthening the [open communities][] here across NASA.

It is a commitment that is often hard. *But it is one that is always
worthwhile.*
