Last month, we submitted our 6 month report on [NASA's Digital
Strategy][] to the Office of Management and Budget. The 6 month
milestones for our [Digital Strategy][] are the 2nd update we've made to
the plan, following our 3 month milestones that we launched in August.
There are a number of new things that we're super excited to share:

**NASA's Digital Services Governance Framework**  
<http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html>  
The Digital Strategy is cross-cutting and involves dozens of leads and
potentially hundreds of potential participants from across the agency.
As a result, as we work towards implementing many of the goals of the
strategy, its imperative that we also look at how we manage our overall
direction and focus to ensure that the right people are getting involved
and that we're working efficiently together.

Our Governance Strategy, the majority of which was written by the
awesome Sarah Rigdon in NASA's Web Services office, plans to help us
focus our efforts by establishing the following:

-   A Clearly Defined Scope of Authority
-   Core Principals to Guide Action
-   Established Roles and Responsibilities
-   A Target State

**An Agency-wide Inventory of Mobile Devices and Contracts**  
[http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html][]  
We also developing an inventory of mobile devices and contracts at the
agency which we expect to deliver to OMB shortly. NASA employees use
thousands of mobile devices, from smartphones to mobile hotspots to
pagers (yes, pagers - they still have some use in specialized
situations!), to stay connected to their work around the globe. We're in
the midst of a major transition to a new service provider under the
[ACES contract][], which has given the agency a great opportunity to
look closer at the mobile services we offer to employees and make them
even better.

Additionally, the CIO group at NASA has focused on our BYOD (Bring Your
Own Device) policy as a major way to empower employees to stay connected
to their work. As part of this, we've realized that mobile interfaces
and responsive design are more important than ever in ensuring the
services NASA offers both internally and to the public are accessible,
usable, and extensible.

As always, our Digital Strategy is available in a number of formats,
including [HTML][NASA's Digital Strategy], [JSON][], [XML][]. It's also
available to the public via [GitHub][].

We hope you're excited as we are with the progress we're making on
implementing a Digital Strategy for NASA. As always, if you have
comments, questions, or feedback for us, please leave us a comment -
we'd love to hear from you!
