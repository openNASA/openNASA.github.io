WASHINGTON -- NASA and government agencies worldwide will host the
second International Space Apps Challenge on April 20-21, with events
across all seven continents and in space.

Participants are encouraged to develop mobile apps, software and
hardware, data visualization, and platform solutions that could
contribute to space exploration missions and help improve life on Earth.

The two-day event will provide an opportunity for government to harness
the expertise and entrepreneurial spirit of citizen explorers to help
address global challenges. During the event, representatives from NASA
and other international space agencies will gather with scientists and
participants to use publicly released open data to create solutions for
50 software, hardware and visualization challenges, including robotics,
citizen science platforms and applications of remote sensing data.
Challenges selected to be worked on during the event will be published
online prior to the event.

The 2012 challenge engaged more than 2,000 participants who collaborated
on more than 100 open source solutions to 71 featured challenges.

"What sets apart the International Space Apps Challenge from other
events is that this is a collaborative opportunity to engage people from
all over the world to participate in space exploration and develop
state-of-the-art technology to improve life on Earth and in space," said
Nick Skytland, program manager of NASA's Open Innovation Program.

We are excited to connect with explorers living and working at McMurdo
Station in Antarctica and onboard the International Space Station.

In addition to the physical locations noted above, there will be a
limited number of satellite locations that are smaller, more informal
events but open for public participation. As always, virtual
participation is available to anyone who would like to connect and
contribute remotely. Registration for citizen participation will open in
March for the main events, satellites and virtual.
