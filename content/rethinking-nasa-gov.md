NASA's web presence is gigantic. We operate thousands of websites
covering pretty much every topic imaginable. Events such as the STS-135
Space Shuttle Launch and the Mars Curiosity rover landing bring millions
of visitors watching streaming video live. According to an [Alexa
report][], NASA.gov is the 732nd most visited website in the world
(498th in the US), beating the White House (2,813th) and a number of
other extremely popular websites.

Since we launched our last design in 2007, the online landscape has
changed. Social Media has exploded and the growth of mobile web traffic
has placed a huge importance on [responsive design][] and adaptive
experiences. As NASA's web team enters a new brainstorming process on
the future of the site, they want \*your\* input on how to make it even
better.

From now until December 19th, NASA is accepting feedback for new ideas
on functionality and strategy. Have a suggestion? Go ahead and submit,
vote, and comment on ideas at <http://nasaweb.ideascale.com>. They'd
love to hear from you!

As a side note, this all fits very well with NASA's [Digital
Strategy][], which is shaping how the agency offers its services to the
public online. There's currently a huge effort to offer more [raw
data][] and [APIs][] for public consumption. We'd love your feedback on
how to improve this initiative, as well!
