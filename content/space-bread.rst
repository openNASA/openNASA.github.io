Last week, the top six global winners were announced for the
International Space Apps Challenge. The `top six challenges`_ were
chosen from the `29 finalists`_ chosen from over `100 submitted
solutions`_ at `25 participating locations`_. But here's the thing,
there were so many incredible ideas submitted to the Space Apps
Challenge that it is almost easy to overlook some of the challenges that
were not highlighted through the global judging process.

**Let me give you an example that I've been sharing with others when
they ask about the innovation that happened at the event.
**

It was 12:00pm on day #2 of the Space Apps Challenge. I was in Oxford,
UK where some of the most innovative solutions originated. I was walking
around, documenting the event and doing interviews with some of the
participants, when I met 16 year old `Sam Wilkinson`_. Sam's not your
ordinary 16 year old and he also didn't have time for an interview. He
did ask a question though...

    | "Nick, what time does judging start this afternoon?"
    |  "4:00pm, but we'll need everyone to wrap up their work a bit
    earlier so that we can make sure you get it submitted on time."
    |  "Okay, do you think I have enough time to try to solve another
    challenge? I'm really interested in `Baker Faire`_."
    |  "Um, well, do you have anyone else working on it with you?"
    |  "No, just me."
    |  "You better get on it then, you only have 3 and half hours max."
    |  "Okay, I'll see what I can do."

Four hours later the judging process started. The judges had a really
difficult time picking the top three teams. Sam submitted a solution
called "Aeration & Low Temperature Baking". Included here is his final
presentation along with the slides he created:

In the end, Sam took third place in Oxford which put him one place out
of qualifying for the global judging. But that didn't slow him down. He
returned home and kept working on his idea. In an email to me a few days
later he writes:

    "Hi again, I tested my hypothesis in my school chemistry lab with
    excellent results!!! Will film it tomorrow (camera broke) and send
    you the link."

Here is the video he posted as well as an explanation from his blog.

"*By using the process of bread aeration, by which carbon dioxide is
actually forced into the bread, the only ingredients required to produce
dough are water, flour and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is mixed with
water to form a 8.4Ã—10-2 mol/L solution of carbonic acid, as well as
excess aqueous carbon dioxide. If the partial pressure of the carbon
dioxide is maintained at 2.5 atm, this concentration of carbonic acid
will be maintained as the system enters a dynamic equilibrium between
the aqueous carbonic acid and gaseous carbon dioxide. The solution is
mixed thoroughly with ordinary flour (and any other required flavourings
i.e. salt, sugar etc.) at a (20/7):1 water:flour ratio in a sealed
container with the carbon dioxide at a consistent partial pressure of
2.5 atm (about the same pressure as carbon dioxide in a soda bottle).
The pressure in the sealed container is then released. This decrease in
pressure causes the carbonic acid which is mixed into the flour to be
converted into carbon dioxide gas. The carbon dioxide that is evolved
from the mixture will be maintained in suspension within the mixture.
Combined with microgravity, this will cause an even, leavened dough to
be formed.*\ "

Sam's solution was later picked up by `Make Magazine's blog`_.

    "Just thought you might be interested that my space bread is getting
    blogged about! Here is the `link`_ to the post on Make The video on
    the post is pretty cool if I do say so myself. Could have done it on
    the weekend with a vacuum cleaner and fizzy water!"

It's an incredible example of the ingenuity we witnessed at the
International Space Apps Challenge. It's people like Sam Wilkinson that
made the event so successful. Space Bread truly showcases the potential
of participatory exploration to help solve our space exploration and
social needs.
