Slug: we-want-your-thoughts-on-connected-an-autoblogography

Earlier tonight, we hosted an advanced screening of the acclaimed
Sundance documentary [Connected: An Autoblogography about Love, Death &
Technology][] at the [NASA IT Summit][].

In “*Connected*“, **Tiffany Shlain**, award-winning filmmaker and
founder of The Webby Awards, traces interdependence througha history,
discovering surprising links between right brain and left; honey bees
and stress; hormones and happiness; technology and nature; progress and
consequences; and parents and children. The result: a personal film with
universal resonance.

If you liked the film, you can also see Tiffany speak at tomorrow's
[TEDxNASA@SiliconValley][], which will also be streamed online [here][].

You can view the trailer below:

We want to know how **you** enjoyed the film and what **your** thoughts
are on how it relates to NASA's continually growing exploration of
collaborative technologies. We'd love to have a discussion in our
comments on this topic and other ideas from the themes seen in the film.
Some potential areas for discussion:

1.  How does collaboration at NASA mirror the idea of connectedness
    shown in the film? Can our ten centers be seen as the trees in the
    forest with a common system of roots?
2.  There was a large emphasis in the film on the impact NASA has had on
    both the filmmaker and the world. What ability does NASA have to
    influence collaboration and inspiration on others? How can we, as an
    IT organization, contribute to this?
3.  How do you as an individual feel you fit in with the bigger mission
    of NASA? How do you see yourself as critical to our success?
4.  Perhaps most importantly: did you like the film? What thoughts do
    you have on the creator's life adventure and her way of illustrating
    it to the viewer? Would you like to see more of these types of
    screenings at future NASA events?
