Every single day, an object graces your fingertips, and manifests a
series of interactions and thoughts. We surround ourselves with them. No
matter where you are, who you’re with, or what you’re doing, something
inanimate is part of your experience. These objects are so integral in
our daily experiences through the age of manufacturing. Procured during
a time when money was seldom and when design was booming, this luxury
overhauled the way we functioned, worked, and lived. But in the modern
era, the implications of manufacturing provide a new set of challenges
and restrictions for the future. We are fighting the very thing we
created in order to advance. Rather than using the same methods of the
past, how can we use the same type of thinking that bred a solution in
the industrial era, for today’s world? That magic technology of the
early 20th century exists in a pocket today.

I spoke with Jon Rogers, operator of MSc `Product Design at the
University of Dundee`_, who shed a little bit of light on how his
passion for design has evolved over the course of his life and how he
continues to be inspired by the “possibilities” of what can be done.
Focused on the in-between of physical and digital, Rogers has paid very
close attention to the post-industrial world through his adventurous
work for the past ten years, before the web had even phased society. Our
conversation reminded me that **true change comes from picking up a
device you don’t know, and teaching yourself how to make something out
of it.** Rogers is just one of many out there, who tangles personal
passions into everyday work.

Responsive, active, and engaging technology is bringing around concepts
that exist in the nook and crannies of imagination. Because of the
widely accessible, free tools we can use at any time on the web, the
generation of possibilities is exploding. Understanding milestones in
this regard, the `1992 Durrell Bishop Marble Answer Machine`_, was one
of the foundry interaction projects that brought life to the intangible.
From that time, we’ve seen `progressive technology that thinks in this
way`_, but makes use of resources available to our everyday. And at the
same time, while we have companies creating hardware that can be
“hacked” (or used for good), we also have software services that are
creating a `landscape socially`_. This is where inspiration and funny
thoughts create meaningful experiences, beyond just the technology
producing it. `Sweet Tweet`_ is one of the most exciting projects
socially and digitally. Produced by `Uniform`_ and Rogers, this design
distributes a prize every time you’re mentioned in a tweet. Just through
our conversation, Rogers introduced so many active and past projects
that propagate constant questioning and learning through data and
technology of the age.

One general question that I think is asked many times, is “\ *what is
the actual, quantifiable value of design in society?*\ ” To answer a
piece of that question, `IDEO`_ produced a document detailing evidence
of design’s value, in a downloadable version `here`_. Not only is the
human-centered design theory evident in research, but it also exists in
practice. NASA’s widely-successful `International Space Apps
Challenge`_, posed an extensive list of problem statements to the
general community, hoping for tangible solutions and concepts. What
started as an idea, grew into one of the largest `hackathon`_ events in
history, boasting 17 countries, 25 cities, 108 organizations, 2083
citizens, 71 challenges, 101 solutions, 3.3 million media impressions,
and all in just 48 hours. What these numbers don’t count, is the amount
of impact these solutions will have on the future. With one of the most
spectacular and disruptive projects resulting from the challenge, Rogers
created a `3D printed Pollen Predictor`_, which exists to represent data
in a physical way.

With an Arduino, paper, and cardboard, Rogers suggests that you can
create anything. Rogers asks, “Can you make it for a dollar?” Questions
like these benefit business models of the future. So go out, buy one
today, “fold some paper around it” and make it fantastic. You may not
know how to connect your device to the web, but that’s okay. Communicate
to the world that making is part of our future, by using the web
effectively by documenting that process well.

We have the successes of the past to prove that the way in which we make
things can procure and embed the future. Line assembly was one of the
most outstanding advances in technology, just as other production
processes continue to be in our everyday. Technology as a catalyst
presented the world with intelligent objects. By mimicking our thoughts,
actions, and habits, design is calibrating mankind towards a world of
unfounded creation. With a blank piece of paper before you and
absolutely no idea how to begin, think about this : don’t just take
after the masses that ride the coat-tails of technology, rather
challenge technology. What manufacturing did for design in the 1930’s,
are what digital tools could do for us right now.

As Rogers states, “\ **the role of you as a maker is to demonstrate the
future, not to conserve the past.**"
