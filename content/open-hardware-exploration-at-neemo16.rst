    It is an amazing rapid prototyping environment that is like a
    Hackathon on the ocean floor.

In April, we had the chance to meet `Eric Stackpole`_ and `David Lang`_
at the `International Space Apps Challenge`_. They had submitted a
challenged called “\ *`OpenROV Framework Development`_*\ ” with the goal
to “\ *further the development of hardware, software, and communications
interfaces to visually and bathymetrically map the ocean floor, in an
opensource fashion*.” `OpenROV`_ captured our interest, not only because
it was one of the top globally recognized solutions submitted during the
event, but because it’s exactly the open source, observation-class ROV
(remotely operated vehicle) we have been looking for! *Let me explain.*

During last year’s NEEMO-15 mission, the NASA Open Government Initiative
built a software platform to engage citizen scientists in helping us
`crowdsource the analysis of the coral reef around the Aquarius
habitat`_. The effort was an overwhelming success. In just over a week,
over 300 citizen scientists discovered over 12,000 features, and
confirmed (or disputed) each others observations over 22,000 times.
Crowdsourcing techniques such as these are being considered in the
overall exploration approach, as NASA plans missions to distant worlds,
including asteroids.

The plans for `OpenROV`_ couldn’t have fit more perfectly with our hopes
of `crowdsourcing science during the NEEMO mission`_. The goal of the
`OpenROV`_ project has been to create an ROV that is low-cost and able
to be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts, but also capable of doing
scientific research. A secondary goal of the project has been to
cultivate a community of citizen science contributors to the design and
implementation of the ROV. The contributors consist of both professional
and amateur underwater robotics enthusiasts.

The promise of `OpenROV`_ is that citizens around the world can create
their own open hardware and help us explore our world. This is why we
invited `Eric Stackpole`_ and `David Lang`_ to join `Chris Gerty`_ and I
at the `NEEMO`_ mission to see how we might combine the open software
and open hardware technology we have collectively developed. If you
aren’t familiar with `NEEMO`_, it’s a NASA analog mission that sends
groups of astronauts, engineers and scientists to live in Aquarius, the
world's only undersea research station, for weeks at a time. As `Brian
McGlaughlin`_ describes it, `NEEMO`_ is "*an amazing rapid prototyping
environment that is like a Hackathon on the ocean floor*." The Aquarius
habitat and its surroundings provide a useful analog for space
exploration. The ocean floor is largely uncharted terrain, has potential
to be explored in great detail, and has the need to send people to only
the most interesting of locations - much the same is true of our
potential off-planet destinations.

The team’s focus during `NEEMO-16`_ was specifically to demonstrate how
open hardware can be used to take imagery of local undersea
environments, and then feed this data into applications that visualize
or crowdsource the analysis, in order that we might better understand
extreme environments. From a technical perspective, the test evaluated
the opportunity for incorporating open source hardware technology into
the program, learning both the benefits and challenges of an open,
distributed development network. The larger benefit of incorporating
`OpenROV`_ is the potential for the engagement and involvement of the
general public. By using a low-cost, open source product, NASA aims to
involve public contributions to their missions as well as inspire
citizen scientists to experiment and explore in their own backyards. Our
objectives for the week were simply to:

-  Establish physical and software techniques to minimize effect of
   ocean currents and sea states on a lightweight ROV,
-  Develop techniques to generate a geotagged imagery dataset of the
   reef,
-  Demonstrate ability to provide real-time situational awareness to
   ongoing `NEEMO`_ seafloor activities, and
-  Interface with other objectives of `NEEMO-16`_ and evaluate use of
   `OpenROV`_ technology for future missions.

The `OpenROV`_ performed spectacularly during the test and the
technology demonstration was a success, which enabled the team to
experiment a bit more using the platform. An undersea sensor package
used by science teams at NEEMO-16 was attached to the OpenROV and
evaluated. Also, images of Aquarius gathered by various underwater
`GoPro`_ cameras were processed by `Autodesk’s 123D`_ image software to
attempt a three-dimensional mapping of structure on the ocean floor.
 Thank you to `Eric Stackpole`_ and `David Lang`_ of
`OpenROV <http://www.openrov.com>`__ for participating in the mission as
well as `Brian McLaughlin`_ from the `Joint Polar Satellite System
(JPSS)`_ project at NASA Goddard for helping to share the story with his
audience on `Wired’s Geek Dad blog`_.
