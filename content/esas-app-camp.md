This week’s ESA App Camp didn’t see canoeing or campfires. Developers
worked diligently despite the Mediterranean heat to create applications
for mobile phones that bring Earth observation and GMES services to the
everyday user.

Ending today at ESRIN, ESA’s centre for Earth observation, in Frascati,
Italy, 21 developers from 17 ESA and EU Member States spent the week
creating mobile applications – or apps – using satellite data.

The goal was to come up with some innovative and off the beaten track
ideas for apps using Earth-monitoring data on smartphones, in particular
by calling on the possibilities offered by the Global Monitoring for
Environment and Security (GMES) programme.

In groups of four, each team worked to create an app under the following
categories: GMES for Everyday Life, Observe and Learn, Play the GaMES
and Discovering Climate Change with GMES.

On a balmy Friday afternoon, developers of the ShareAware app won the
challenge. Their app aims to interconnect people concerned about the
environment to understand, learn about, be prepared for or react to
various events or remote sensing results.

Organised by environmental ‘themes’, such as water, air quality,
deforestation or disasters, users could browse the datasets and report
on a certain issue relevant for that theme and location – a ‘callout’.

Users could write a short message or post an image in their callouts.
GMES products would also be made available for reference in the various
thematic areas.

Members of the winning team were each presented with an iPad3.

The other apps developed during the week included the educational app
GEOLife that shows how Earth observation data can affect our daily
lives. TeakGuard aims to protect rainforests from illegal logging,
4Sense is in the game category and EnviSim attempts to simulate the
effect of policy decisions and technical developments on Earth’s climate
and environment.

Participants of the App Camp are encouraged to submit their apps to the
ESA App Challenge by 16 September for the chance to win support by one
of the seven ESA Business Incubation Centres, valued at €60 000.

The App Challenge is an initiative of ESA’s GMES Space Office to promote
awareness of GMES to a wider community. It complements the GMES Master
Prize competition, which awards prizes for the best projects and
business ideas involving commercial GMES applications. It supports the
development of market-oriented applications that use data from the
programme.

The App Camp was devised by the GMES Space Office and co-sponsored by
the Technology Transfer Programme Office.
