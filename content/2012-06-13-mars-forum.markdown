NASA is currently charting a new agency-wide strategy for the future of Mars exploration, both robotic and human.  Involvement from the science & technical community and all interested members of the general public is essential to this process.

Today, NASA’s Mars Program Planning Group (MPPG) is opening up a new opportunity for the public to pose questions and participate in the discussion regarding plans for the future of Mars exploration.  We need your help to get the word out about the Mars Forum:

This online community, open from today through July 1, 2012, allows the scientific & technical community and all interested members of the general public to:

* **Ask **(today-July 1): Pose questions, offer answers, and vote on the most important user-generated content related to the [Mars program planning effort](http://www.nasa.gov/marsplanning);
* **Discuss **(June 12-14): Comment online and tune in to the [Concepts and Approaches for Mars Exploration Workshop](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/marsconcepts2012/), via Live Stream; and

**It's time to make plans. **
