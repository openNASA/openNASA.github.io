Last weekend, the `Expedition 28`_ crew onboard the International Space
Station heard that their return home will be postponed from September
8th to an anticipated landing on September 16th due to the `failure`_ of
a Russian Progress cargo vehicle on August 24th. Although I don’t think
anyone would disagree with the fact that space travel is pretty much the
most incredible opportunity anyone on this planet can have, I can
imagine that, after six months onboard the Station, one must get a
little homesick.

Astronaut `Ron Garan`_ is no exception - his departure delay has given
him a stroke of orbital blues. The most fascinating thing to me about
his latest video from space is not his musical talents (sorry, Ron) but
rather the incredible view it gives of the International Space Station,
courtesy Astronaut `Mike Fossum`_. The massive size of the interior of
the station never ceases to shock me.  Take a look:

If you haven’t already, be sure to also check out `Fragile Oasis`_, a
project Ron started to share and explore projects around the world
contributing to making our planet a better place to live. It’s a perfect
example of OpenGov in action and a great community to join!
