We had a very large response to the International Space Apps Challenge this year by people who were participating virtually. Over 2,200 people from all corners of the world participated online to tackle the 58 challenges. 170 solutions were submitted and today we are announcing the top 4 virtual winners! These teams will progress to the global judging round and will also receive two K’NEX Building Sets which were provided by the organizers of the Philadelphia Main Stage location.
