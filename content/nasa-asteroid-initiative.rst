On Tuesday, June 18, NASA proudly `announced a Grand Challenge`_ “to
find all asteroid threats to human populations and know what to do about
them” at the Asteroid Initiative Industry and Partner Day in Washington,
DC. The goals of the day were to (1) provide more detail about the
Asteroid Redirect Mission planning to find, capture, and redirect a 7-10
meter asteroid into a translunar orbit so astronauts can explore it and
bring back samples to Earth, (2) announce the Grand Challenge a brand
new effort and new way for NASA to do business, and (3) release a
Request for Information (RFI) to solicit ideas and concepts that could
support both. The Asteroid Initiative proposed in the FY14 President's
budget for NASA includes two synergistic components: the Asteroid
Redirect Mission and the Grand Challenge.

The essence of this stage of the Grand Challenge is to begin to engage
in a broad conversation with traditional and non-traditional partners to
collaboratively design an implementation plan to manage the many
pathways to address this Challenge. While there is no imminent danger
from a hazardous asteroid and NASA has led a global effort resulting in
discovery of 95 percent of the potentially devastating 1 km wide
near-Earth asteroids, more needs to be done. Asteroid impacts and
explosions from objects much smaller than 1 km, like the one over Russia
in February, have the capability of rendering massive devastation and
most of the objects of that size are undiscovered.

In order to accelerate and enhance the existing global effort, NASA has
issued this Call to Action to expand the conversations about ways to
work more collaboratively on science, technology development and threat
mitigation for the Grand Challenge. Recognizing the power of traditional
and innovative collaboration – including the use of public private
partnerships, citizen science, crowdsourcing, and incentive prizes, in
addition to international and other cooperative partnerships – NASA will
lead a dialogue addressing how to best use these methods to aid in
solving this global problem, together.

| **So how can you get involved?**
|  NASA has issued \ `this Request for Information`_ to gather ideas and
concepts on how best to engage the community and develop solutions for
the Asteroid Initiative, which includes both the Grand Challenge and the
Asteroid Redirect Mission. The RFI is open to all organizations and
individuals, and submissions are due July 18. To help address questions
from potential respondents, NASA technical experts will host a Google+
Hangout on June 27. You can send RFI-related questions
to \ hq-asteroid-rfi@mail.nasa.gov in advance and during the Google+
Hangout.

The RFI is just the first of multiple engagement opportunitiesfor the
Grand Challenge – including online brainstorming and a fall workshop –
to meaningfully engage stakeholders. What kind of contributions would
you like to make? What can you envision as possible? Share your thoughts
below in the comments and via social media (**#NASAAsteroid**) – we're
listening, and we'll let you know as additional opportunities become
available.
