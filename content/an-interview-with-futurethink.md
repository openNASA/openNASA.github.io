I had the opportunity to talk to [futurethink][] about NASA’s Open
Innovation Program. This is a cross-post of the [interview][] from their
website.   A longer version of this interview will be published (and
linked here) in a few days.

> **1) How does a large organization like NASA manage its innovation
> process? (And more specifically, the Open NASA initiative?)**
>
> For the last century, we have relied on governments to tackle the
> grand challenges of our time and to manage the innovation process
> within government by themselves. For the average citizen,
> participating in government was extremely limited – you could show up
> to vote on election day, express your concern by protesting about a
> cause, or if you really wanted to make a change, apply for a
> government job.
>
> Most people had very little influence on how business in government
> was conducted and how innovation was managed (if it was managed at
> all). This severely limited not only the number of people working on
> solving our nation’s toughest challenges, but also limited the
> diversity in perspective contributed towards the solutions.
>
> Over the past few years, we have witnessed the emergence of technology
> that is slowly starting to change the way governments approach
> innovation and opening up new ways to participate directly in
> government. At NASA, we are just beginning to rethink what this means
> for how we manage our innovation process. We are starting to embrace
> openness as a catalyst to innovation and providing unprecedented
> access to our raw data, software and technology to a wide base of
> potential contributors. We are also starting to shift away from purely
> competitive approaches and also embrace new paradigm shifting
> collaboration.
>
> Because of this shift, we are starting to enable breakthroughs to
> proceed at a faster rate than was possible before. We work with others
> to show how they can leverage distributed collaboration to focus the
> investment of thousands of individual effort hours by citizens across
> the country towards constructive projects that benefit both NASA and
> the nation.
>
> **2) How do you select which ideas to invest in and move forward
> with?**
>
> Government agencies must find groups of people, bring them together
> around an issue or problem that needs to be fixed, then step out of
> the way and let the collective energy of the people involved solve
> problems in creative and imaginative ways that we would never have
> done ourselves. It’s not just about individual participation; it’s
> about mass collaboration. It’s about creating platforms that allow us
> to take advantage of the exponential power of what happens when a
> thousand eyes look at our toughest problems and we collectively
> develop a solution.
>
> The key to this is to build a platform for collaboration that doesn’t
> prescribe our own solution and then rewards the best ideas with the
> recognition they deserve. Our approach within the Open Innovation
> Program has been to identify and prioritize the challenges most worth
> solving, build a platform to engage a large diverse group of
> participants around the challenge, incentivize them (through
> collaboration) to develop a solution, and then let the best ideas rise
> to the top naturally.
>
> **3) What are some collaborations the program has facilitated that
> have led to new ideas and solutions?**
>
> An amazing collaboration that has come out of our work that has led to
> new ideas and solutions is the [Random Hacks of Kindness][] project.
> Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative
> encompassing a core team of collaborators including [NASA][], [World
> Bank][], [Microsoft][], [Google][], [Yahoo][] and [HP][], an ever
> expanding ecosystem of supporting organizations, and a community of
> over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries collectively working to
> make the world a better place.
>
> Based on our experience with Random Hacks of Kindness, we developed
> the [International Space Apps Challenge][] which is an international
> mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over
> 48-hours in cities around the world. In April of 2012, we hosted the
> first International Space Apps Challenge. The event embraces
> collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant
> open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life
> on Earth and life in space. The event took place in 25 countries
> around the world and resulted in over 100 solutions. It was the
> largest government-led mass collaboration event to date, and a
> testament to what people can accomplish together if given the
> permission, opportunity, and resources.
>
> The event demonstrated that the creativity and innovation that used to
> take place primarily behind closed doors within large institutions is
> increasingly taking place by people connected together online. By
> tapping into a global community of expertise, partnering with leading
> researchers, scientists, technologists, academics and entrepreneurs as
> well as collaborating directly with citizens and innovative
> organizations on projects like Random Hacks of Kindness and the
> International Space Apps Challenge, we are able to develop solutions
> that we would have never came up with on our own. Solutions that may
> have a lasting impacts on both NASA and the world.
>
> **3) What is the single biggest challenge to making innovation happen
> at NASA? (And how do you overcome them?)**
>
> The single biggest challenge to making innovation happen at NASA is
> simply “*culture*.” If you want to see how innovative an organization
> truly is (not just how people perceive it to be), simply take a good
> hard look at its culture. To move beyond this, we must challenge
> long-standing business management orthodoxies – even the cultural
> ones.
>
> The grand challenges today are too complex – the ones worth solving
> will require all of us. But changing the culture of an entire
> organization as big as NASA seems like a nearly impossible task at
> first, so you have to lead by example and start small. Innovation is
> all about challenging prevailing assumptions about the way we have
> done things in the past and suggesting better approaches. It’s about
> staying nimble by minimizing complexity.
>
> **5) What is your favorite innovation that has come out of the Open
> Innovation Program?**
>
> My favorite example is that of the [VICAR2PNG][] project which helped
> unlock some valuable NASA data. NASA really has an unparalleled trove
> of scientific and engineering data that represents an incredible asset
> that we want the public to utilize. At the [2012 International Space
> Apps Challenge][], we offered a challenge to improve access to NASA
> data. As it turns out, much of the image data from NASA’s missions in
> the Planetary Image Atlas was in an very outdated VICAR format. As the
> developers soon found out, VICAR was unreadable by any existing open
> source image conversion tools, so they set out to create one! They
> wrote and packaged a solution called “vicar2png” so that anyone can
> view, enjoy, and remix NASA’s mission image data easily by converting
> VICAR files to the popular PNG image format. To demonstrate the
> potential of the solution (and the data), they then created movies
> using PNGs from several segments of raw images from the
> Cassini-Huygens mission. The solution showcased the potential of
> what’s possible by making NASA’s data more accessible.
