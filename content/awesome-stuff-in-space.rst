Awesome Stuff in Space

There are a couple of man-made objects in space that almost everyone
will know about: the International Space Station, the Hubble Space
Telescope, Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity and maybe Voyager I and/or
 II. However, there is so much other man-made stuff in space it’s crazy
(and it’s actually starting to become a `problem`_). This abundance of
space-faring objects can make it hard for some truly awesome
experiments, missions etc to get much exposure! I’d like to fix that
with a recurring blog post series called “Awesome Stuff in Space”. Since
this is the inaugural post, I’m going to cover two of the coolest
lesser-known things currently in space (in my humble opinion), as well
as an awesome example of recycling (which is no longer in space).

1. `LAGEOS`_: The (really useful) orbital disco ball

When asked what the most precise method currently available for
determining the position of a place on earth was, my first response
would probably be military-grade GPS, but I’d be wrong. In fact, the
most precise way to determine your position on earth is by bouncing a
laser beam off of what is essentially a disco ball in space. That disco
ball would either be LAGEOS-1 or LAGEOS-2 (***LA***\ ser
***GEO***\ dynamics\ ***S***\ atellite), `two 60cm wide spheres`_ each
covered in 426 retroreflectors (a special mirror that reflects light
back the way it came) currently orbiting the earth at `5,900km above
us`_. By measuring the time taken for a laser pulse to travel to a
LAGEOS satellite and back, the distance between the ground station and
the satellite can be calculated to a very high degree of accuracy (~1
inch for thousands of miles). Since the orbits of the LAGEOS satellites
are very stable, their positions can be determined to a high degree of
accuracy. This coupled with the distance between the ground station and
the satellite can be used to determine the precise location of the
ground station. There are ground stations performing these measurements
in many countries, and the results are used to study tectonic plate
movement by groups from around the world.

2. `Dawn`_: Exploring new frontiers in new ways

One of my favourite statistics on the solar system is this:
approximately 42% of the mass of the asteroid belt is made up from just
two objects, the dwarf planet `Ceres`_ and the asteroid `Vesta`_. These
also happen to be the two main objectives for the spacecraft Dawn,
launched in September of 2007. Dawn has already travelled to Vesta, and
is currently en route to Ceres. The study of Ceres and Vesta will
greatly contribute to our understanding of the formation of planets.
Since Ceres and Vesta are the two largest remaining
protoplanets (planetary embryos) in the solar system, the observation of
these objects will give us a peek at the earliest stages in the
formation of the solar system. What makes Dawn even more special, aside
from it being the first craft to travel to both Vesta and Ceres
(hopefully), is that it is NASA’s first purely exploratory mission to
use `ion thrusters`_ as its sole mode of propulsion.

3. `SuitSat-1`_: “A Russian Brainstorm”

The concept behind SuitSat-1 is quite simple, put some simple
electronics (radio communications system, telemetry) into a Russian
Orlan spacesuit, then throw it out of the airlock. According to Frank
Bauer of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, “SuitSat is a Russian
brainstorm, some of our Russian partners in the ISS program ... had an
idea: Maybe we can turn old spacesuits into useful satellites." Aside
from broadcasting voice messages from students around the world, and
some telemetry data, SuitSat-1 also looked really eerie. Images of
Suit-Sat as it was being jettisoned from the ISS are kind of haunting...
