How do you enable 7000+ people to work together over 83 hours and across 24 time zones? One of those tools is hangouts! Hangouts provide a forum for video, voice and text collaboration between different locations, and they will be a key piece of our Space Apps collaboration strategy. Some hangouts will be pre-planned (like the ones you see below) - some will happen more serendipitously as collaborations come together. Some projects have already done introductory Hangouts to introduce their efforts, like [openROV](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=b91CcuttprY).  However they happen, we definitely need your help to get the word out at your event and in your language to get and keep everyone connected! _(We'll add additional major hangouts here if new ones are planned going forward.) _
