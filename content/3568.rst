There are many voices of NASA. NASA leadership, noted scientists, public
affairs writers, nobel lauretes, Congressional Representatives, Union
leaders, your neighbor. To the average person, including our friends and
relatives, the image and message gets cloudy and distorted. This is a
collaborative website written by NASA employees across the agency, and
occasional invited guests. We come from a perspective within NASA of
transparency, accessibility, risk, honesty, merit, and participation. We
have insight into what is and could be happening inside the U.S. space
program– but so do you, and it is something to be shared and discussed.
Let’s create a space program which stimulates non-governmental activity,
excitement and inspiration, and which guides humanity onto a sustainable
path into the future. This is the voice of promise and opportunity. This
is our voice. Feel free to visit our authors page for more information
on who we are. Feel free to email spacegeeks at opennasa dot com if you
have questions or comments.
