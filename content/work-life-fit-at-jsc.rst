A few weeks ago, the Joint Leadership Team (JLT) at Johnson Space Center
(JSC) was treated to a day-long retreat of presentations from each of
the Innovation and Inclusion (I&I) Council’s Engagement Teams. I know it
seems like classic “NASA acronym soup”, but there was nothing classic
about how far the audience was reaching outside of their comfort zone
that day.

Perhaps the furthest-reaching team was called Barrier Analysis. You
might be familiar with that team’s video, since as of now it's received
over 92,000 hits on You Tube. That’s right, it’s the one from `Wayne
Hale’s blog post`_ and the `NPR story`_. There's even a good summary of
its background `here on OpenNASA`_. It has been great to see the
conversation that has started among NASA employees and the general
public alike. The other teams also had some very interesting (if not
quite as controversial) contributions relating to the inner-workings of
the JSC Community. They looked internally at challenges such as
Recruiting, Mentoring, IT Infrastructure, or Work-Life Fit. Personally,
I had the privilege of working with 12 others to study the latter, and
in the spirit of being open, I'd like to share with the OpenNASA readers
the results of our work.

The Work-Life Fit team was made up of employees from across the center,
civil servants and contractors, including some subject matter experts
and a facilitator to help keep the varying perspectives focused on our
goal. That goal was to conduct a short study, addressing three general
areas:

   Develop ideas on how to market current flexibilities, encouraging

Given the challenge to think outside of PowerPoint for our presentation,
we decided pretty early to put together a video that caught the
audience’s attention, and highlighted our key findings and
recommendations. Knowing we would have folks in the room that needed to
immediately discuss our suggestions, we accompanied the video with a
summary `one-pager`_, and of course we had a more detailed `white
paper`_ that fully explained the research that brought us to our
conclusions.

Our video was split into two parts, the first of which reflected on why
fitting work and life together effectively was important – and
particularly at NASA/Johnson Space Center. The videos on YouTube have a
“Watch in High Quality” link, so make sure to click just to the
bottom-right of the video. Here’s Part One, which we showed to introduce
the subject of Work-Life Fit at the Johnson Space Center (JSC):

 

`Work-Life Fit at JSC: Part 1 (YouTube video)`_

During the interlude we asked the audience a few prying questions to
help communicate some of the “eureka moments” we had. First we wanted to
convey the difference between Work-Life Fit, and Work-Life
Balance/Segregation, so we asked how many people who were given a
Blackberry for work, used it to communicate on occasion with their
spouse. We then asked if anyone ever carried a separate cell phone for
work and personal calls. To us, this was a simple example of the
difference between integrating, and balancing. After a few more of those
types of questions we came back around to the use of technology by
asking how many people used a cell phone, pager, or PDA in college or
high school to be more productive in work *and* life. Very few hands
went up. Our point here was that 100% of new-hires are familiar with the
use of these technologies. This younger generation can be very effective
when given flexibilities which allow them to manage their life and work.

| The second video was a few minutes longer, and specifically addressed
our recommendations and gave a preview of some of the data we used to
make our conclusions.

Keep in mind that these are only recommendations, and not sanctioned or
accepted by NASA as of yet. Hopefully after presenting to the Joint
Leadership Team we have opened a few eyes and sparked some conversations
within the gates of the Johnson Space Center, and maybe by posting it
here we’ll even get some feedback from outside the gates. So after
watching the video and/or reading our written publications which
accompany it, what are your thoughts? How does the JSC community compare
to others with respect to Work-Life Fit? How do you fit work with your
personal lives?
