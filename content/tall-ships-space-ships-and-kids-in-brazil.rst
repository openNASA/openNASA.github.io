… a great mix! Starting June 15, the Tocorime’ Pamatojare, Brazil’s
largest sailing ship, will host the kick off of “\ `Following
Darwin`_\ ”, an environmentally focused educational outreach expedition
along the coast of Brazil. For five days in June in Rio de Janeiro
harbor, school kids, teachers, community leaders, and the public will be
welcomed aboard to see and hear about the upcoming voyage of the
Tocorime’ Pamatojare, which means “Adventurous Spirit” in Portuguese, to
sail to the ports of call of the HMS Beagle. The theme of the expedition
is Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development as it relates to
the coastal environs of Brazil. These events, exhibits, and public talks
coincide with the `United Nations Rio +20 Conference on Sustainable
Development`_.

Publicly available astronaut photography taken aboard the International
Space Station (ISS) will provide the big view; showing off the beauty of
the Brazilian coast while helping to link the ecosystems, marine
biology, and oceanography with coastal development. Astronauts such as
`Mike Barratt`_ add the human exploration perspective, linking the crews
of the ISS to the crews of the tall ships and the Beagle’s voyage 180
years ago.

The educational and public outreach events in Brazil are just one
example of the growing use of astronaut photography  to teach and learn
about life on Earth. The image collections are cataloged and maintained
by the Crew Earth Observation ISS payload team at Johnson Space Center
and the `Astromaterials Research and Explorations Science (ARES)
Directorate`_. Through the `Gateway to Astronaut Photography`_, the
public can find collections such as Earth from Space, images from the
International Polar Year, or the wildly popular `time sequence videos of
auroras, city lights, coastal regions, and celestial phenomena`_.

In September 2009, a team of marine biologists and oceanographers from
around South America, the UK, and the US met in Paraty, Brazil for the
first educational outreach event aboard the Tocorime’ and in area
schools. Organized by the `HMS Beagle Project`_, a UK charity, the event
also featured NASA astronaut photography and a live ham-radio call from
Mike Barratt on the ISS to the kids of Paraty. The event was a great
success with a variety of hands-on marine biology experiences for the
kids, including DNA sequencing of marine organisms in Paraty harbor led
by a biologist from the `Barcode of Life Project`_. More such events are
planned for Following Darwin as it begins to circumnavigate South
America beginning in September.

Partners for the Rio+20 events include the host educational institution
IASEA (Institutio Para Aprendizagem Social, Emocional e Academica) and
the tall-ship `Tocorime’`_, the University of Sao Paolo – Zoology Museum
and Oceanographic Institute, the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment
and Ministry of Culture, National Geographic-Brazil, the British
Council, and the HMS Beagle Project. Once again, NASA’s astronaut
photography and science education and outreach programs will play a
part.

Astronaut photography also serves as a focal point for `Expedition Earth
and Beyond`_. This NASA/JSC/ARES education program is designed to
facilitate student-driven, authentic research projects to study the
Earth and to compare Earth to other planetary bodies such as the Moon
and Mars. Images of Earth acquired by astronauts are the hook for
getting students interested and involved in the program.

The future looks bright for all of these partners; greater involvement
of NASA public resources from the ISS, a possible circumnavigation of
South America on a tall-ship following the voyage of Darwin’s Beagle,
and opportunities for thousands of kids to learn about the importance of
Earth science, protection of the environment, and sustainable living.
Tall-ships, space ships, and kids learning about the Earth; a great mix
indeed!

**Hope you'll stay tuned and follow the adventure!**\ *We'll be
following the Tocorime's explorations over the next few weeks - feel
free to leave a note here to share with the crew and the students. You
