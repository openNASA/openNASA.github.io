Yesterday, the White House [open sourced its first project][] on Github,
"[We The People][]", the popular e-petitions platform that powers
[petitions.whitehouse.gov][].

It's great to see other organizations in the government participating in
the open source movement and releasing their code with the goal of
engaging the public, improving the services they offer, and encouraging
the sharing of public resources. As you may know, NASA has been
extremely active in the open source community. Our open source hub,
[code.nasa.gov][], currently lists dozens of open source projects at the
agency, and our [GitHub page][] hosts 11 public repositories (including
the most recent, our [digital strategy][]). We're also big users of open
source projects, such as [nginx][], [Bootstrap][], and [Eclipse][]. In
June of this year, we held our second successful [Open Source Summit][]
(this time at the University of Maryland).

I've been keeping a close eye on the We The People platform for possible
uses at NASA, and now that it's just a one-click fork away, it will be
even easier to deploy if we find ourselves needing the functionality it
provides. Kudos to the White House for joining the open source community
on Github!

Wanstrath, with O'Reilly Media discussing NASA, open source, and
