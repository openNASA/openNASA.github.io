The foundation of the Open Government movement at NASA is the `Open
Government Plan`_, which was released on April 7, 2010 as part of
President Obama's Open Government Directive. The principles of Open
Government have been embedded in NASA operations for 50 plus years. The
plan is our start in revisiting these concepts and creating a new level
of openness and accountability in our policies, technology, and overall
culture.

One of the most vital components of the plan is the over 150 milestones
and goals set for organizations across the agency to implement Open
Government-related programs and policies over the next five years. As
part of this, we are working to keep you updated on the progress of
these goals. There are three ways to keep track of NASA's progress on
the OpenGov Plan:
