`Global voting starts today for the International Space Apps
Challenge`_! The Space Apps Challenge fosters innovation by providing a
platform for citizens from around the world to work together to solve
current challenges relevant to both space exploration and social
need. The `Innovation Endeavors`_ and `Talenthouse`_ community of
investors, entrepreneurs and advisors are here to support and celebrate
these teams and their innovations to the fifty challenges - and invite
you to vote for your favorite App. The final winners will be determined
with your votes and along with an internationally recognized jury of
investors and entrepreneurs from Innovation Endeavors.

The videos submitted on behalf of each nominated project also
demonstrate the vision of the collaboration process, the passion of the
participants, and what it means to them to engage the data in their
context. These videos tell the story about what is possible when people
get a vision about exploration and for changing the world with science.
*What earth observation data could help people, organizations, and
governments make better decisions? How can we convey the orbital
perspective to people on Earth? What are other low-cost off-the-shelf
hardware options for exploration? What are new ways we could visualize
data? How else could we communicate ideas too big for words or organize
data bigger than we have yet been able to manage? What new things can we
learn when we mashup data sources? How can we share data more
efficiently?* Space Apps asked all these questions in the global
community - and discovered some interesting ideas and answers along the
way.

**The nominated apps:  `(main voting page)`_**

`Aurora Project: Model & Data`_ (`Dublin, Ireland`_) An app that
visualizes near-real time aurora data. During the Science Hack Day
Dublin in March, we built up an Aurora Lamp. This consisted on an
artistic representation of an Aurora using LEDs. However, this was not
connected with any data feed. For the Space Apps Challenge we tried to
improve this original project by using real data. On one side we
developed a program that automatically downloads and processes data from
NOAA's POES satellites. This gives an indication of aurora activity.
However, as the satellites measure just what is below them the data
needs to be extrapolated to show all the hemisphere. Simultaneously, we
also developed software to generate a layer for Google Earth showing the
forecast of aurora activity. This is based on magnetic field
measurements from NASA's ACE spacecraft. `Vote here.`_

`Code/Game Controller/Water Sampling Mechanism OpenROV Framework
Development Challenge`_ (`San Francisco, USA`_) OpenROV is a DIY
telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration and
education. The community has developed a low-cost telerobotic submarine
that can be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and is increasingly
capable of doing serious scientific research. The goal of the project is
to democratize exploration by allowing anyone to explore and study
underwater environments. The OpenROV community is also laying the
foundation for globally-connected citizen scientists to share their data
and findings. \ `Vote

[spaceappschallenge.org] by a team of three amazing geniuses who knew
nothing about space before they started this...and still don't
really. Currently the data is provided by
http://exoplanetology.blogspot.com/ who in turn feeds the data from
http://exoplanet.eu/. The ExoAPI team plans on extending the API to
encompass a wider array of data sources and more interesting space data
to reach as many programmers as possible and encourage an explosion of
space data based mashups. `Vote

Dominican Republic`_) An app that explores the potential of unused land
for the growing of fruit, vegetable and other crops through the use of
location, climate and growing data. The Grower's Nation application is
designed to reduce the barriers to growing by taking location, climate
and growing conditions data into consideration and aims to give more
people the information they need when selecting what to grow.  The crop
dataset we are creating is possibly the first of its kind that is
available open source, and will enable cross referencing of crop,
climate, weather and soil data. When complete, it will include the
growing conditions required for different varieties of fruit, vegetables
and grains. During the challenge weekend, we had some great
collaborations with teams from around the world including: Exeter, San
Francisco, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Nairobi and New York. We hope
to continue collaborating with related projects into the future. There
is a lot of potential for follow on work from this project and the
Growers Nation team members are enthusiastic to continue working on what
they regard as a very worthwhile project. `Vote

`Vicar2png`_ `(Virtual Participation`_) Much of the image data from
NASA's Planetary Image Atlas is in the VICAR format, which was
unreadable by any existing open source image conversion tools. We wrote
and packaged vicar2png so that anyone can view, enjoy, and remix NASA's
mission image data easily by converting VICAR files to the popular PNG
image format. Our submission video demos vicar2png and showcases some
beautiful images we converted from NASA's Cassini mission, as well as a
short movie stitched together from raw Cassini data. `Vote

`Connect and Survive!`_ (`Exeter, United Kingdom`_) We want people to
learn to manage long-term healthcare through connecting to healthcare
information in their homes. If we only ever use computers to connect
people to data then we are neglecting the majority of the global
population. At the SpaceApps Challenge in Exeter we made a demonstrator
Pollen Predictor that used live pollen data to change the colour of a 3D
printed pollen ball. The colour of the ball is used to represent the
next day's pollen level. So what next? We would love to develop this
into a standalone Physical App that enables people to see data. In the
first place we would like to design products to help children manage
asthma caused by pollen allergies and to test this across a range of
cultures and languages. \ `Vote here. `_

`Growing Fruits: Pineapple Project`_ (`Santo Domingo`_, Dominican
Republic) Our success was the result of a dedicated team that is
passionate about exploring the potential of unused land for growing
fruit, vegetables and other crops. Multiple resources (currently in the
Beta testing phase) have been designed to reduce the barriers to growing
by taking location, climate, and growing requirements into consideration
to provide potential farmers recommendations they need when deciding
what to plant. `Vote

`CERES`_ (`New York, New York`_) Farmers in the developing world lack
proper access to food pricing information. Without proper information,
rural farmers are vulnerable to a variety of problems.CERES solves these
problems by allowing farmers to exchange commodity price information
with their peers, allowing them to make better-informed decisions.
Farmers interact with the service by using SMS to check current prices
within seconds. For large purchasers and governments, CERES provides a
powerful web interface for decision makers to view the data in
aggregate. Over the coming months, our launch partner, Opportunity
