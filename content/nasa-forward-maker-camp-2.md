NASA Forward Maker Camp has been an effective experiment in new ways
to engage the workforce in fast, hyper local projects that advance
NASA’s mission and vision. The event provides a chance to pursue
projects of value to the NASA mission that might not normally be done
and also to collaborate with others from around the agency who are doing
interesting work in diverse fields. Based on the “maker” culture, Maker
Camp makes hands-on creating and experimenting accessible to all parties
and incubates innovative thinking and *doing*. Johnson Space Center and
Ames Research Center recently partnered to hold the third such event,
the first to allow other centers to participate remotely. Highlights of
this Maker Camp included the projects and teams, the remote
participation, and the use of a variety of collaborative spaces.

**Diverse local projects addressed by short-term teams: **12 projects
were submitted for the JSC-ARC Camp, including ideas around hardware,
software, process improvement, and website development. Only a few had
been prepared by the event leadership; many were contributed day-of by
participants across centers. All project progress was documented via
wiki so that teams can continue to work on their chosen projects at
later dates or pass on the work to others. While many were more
self-contained, a few of the projects were able to provide catalytic
contributions to longer-term, ongoing NASA efforts.

**Use of collaborative platforms:**The event used AdobeConnect to
collaborate virtually with others at ARC and Goddard, allowing everyone
to provide real-time feedback and cross-pollination from different
centers and disciplines. The tool was very effective with audio, video,
chat, and screen sharing capabilities, and allowed the varied projects
to see each others’ work and the participants to ask questions
continuously.

**Use of collaborative spaces:** The collaborative spaces proved ideal
for the diverse teams to work together, in the main collaborative sp.ace
as well as the Sandbox (JSC’s new Innovation Design workshop/fabrication
space.) (See [this post][]for more on collaborative spaces at JSC and
across NASA.) One of the projects even included advancing the
development of a new collaborative space at another center.
