NASA released a new iPad app called the NASA Visualization Explorer which is "the coolest way to get stories about NASA's space-based Earth science research". The NASA Visualization Explorer relies on computer images built from satellite data for most of its pictures. Topics include climate change, aerosols, glaciers, hurricanes, volcanoes and wildfires; all things observed by NASA satellites. 

[Download it the NASA VIZ app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nasa-visualization-explorer/id448700202?ls=1&mt=8), free of charge, at the App Store now and see a world of often intangible data brought to life in stunning and beautiful form.
