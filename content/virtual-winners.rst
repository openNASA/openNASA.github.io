We had a very large response to the International Space Apps Challenge
this year by people who were participating virtually. Over 2,200 people
from all corners of the world participated online to tackle the 58
challenges. 170 solutions were submitted and today we are announcing the
top 4 virtual winners! These teams will progress to the global judging
round and will also receive two K’NEX Building Sets which were provided
by the organizers of the Philadelphia Main Stage location.
