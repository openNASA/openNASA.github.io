**Mars Data**

Have you seen this? `Chris Herwig`_ set out to map Mars with open data
and open source tools. The `results`_ are pretty spectacular, along with
the story of how he did it. `Here's`_ where you can explore more of Mars
yourself with open planetary data. This is what openness is all about:
what the data can make possible, how it can engage you, pull you in.
What could you build with the live data and images from Mars? How could
it stir people's imagination about exploration?

More Mars data can be found `here`_ - and we'd love to see what you
create.

**Mars Music**

NASA is holding a celebration this afternoon at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA, to share findings about Mars with
students and premiere a new song by musician will.i.am that will be
broadcast from the surface of the Red Planet via the Curiosity
rover. Members of the team that successfully landed the rover on Mars
earlier this month will explain to students the mission and the
technology behind the song's interplanetary transmission. will.i.am will
then premiere "Reach for the Stars," a new composition about the
singer's passion for science, technology and space exploration.

Go \ `here <http://www.nasa.gov/ntv>`__ to watch the event live (1 p.m.
PDT /4 p.m. EDT) - don't miss this first interplanetary musical release!
