**Mars Data**

Have you seen this? [Chris Herwig](http://twitter.com/hrwgc) set out to map Mars with open data and open source tools. The [results](http://mapbox.com/blog/2012-08-26-mapping-mars/) are pretty spectacular, along with the story of how he did it. [Here's](http://hrwgc.github.com/planets/) where you can explore more of Mars yourself with open planetary data. This is what openness is all about: what the data can make possible, how it can engage you, pull you in. What could you build with the live data and images from Mars? How could it stir people's imagination about exploration?

More Mars data can be found [here](http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/raw/?s=15) - and we'd love to see what you create.

**Mars Music**

NASA is holding a celebration this afternoon at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, CA, to share findings about Mars with students and premiere a new song by musician will.i.am that will be broadcast from the surface of the Red Planet via the Curiosity rover. Members of the team that successfully landed the rover on Mars earlier this month will explain to students the mission and the technology behind the song's interplanetary transmission. will.i.am will then premiere "Reach for the Stars," a new composition about the singer's passion for science, technology and space exploration.

Go [here](http://www.nasa.gov/ntv) to watch the event live (1 p.m. PDT /4 p.m. EDT) - don't miss this first interplanetary musical release!
