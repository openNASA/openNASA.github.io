I had an opportunity to talk about NASA Open Government Initiative and
the use of Social Media to engage citizen’s at the `Gov 2.0
Conference`_ early today at the National Convention Center in Canberra,
Australia. The presentation builds on a number of previous presentations
about Open Government and social media at NASA, and continues to explore
how YOU can engage citizens in your mission by better understanding on
how to harness the opportunities Open Government presents.   We talked a
lot about how to engaging citizens through the use of Web 2.0 technology
and how government agencies move towards an open and transparent
government.  The presentation covers a lot of best practices from recent
work at NASA.

`Chris Gerty`_ and I have also been experimenting with some video
animation techniques and I used the Q&A portion of today’s talk to recap
the talk with the following video.  It’s still rough, and we’re still
experimenting with the technique, but I think it really turned out well!
