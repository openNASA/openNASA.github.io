Late last month, the Goddard-led GMAT team unveiled the General Mission
Analysis Tool R2012a, the latest in a line of beta feature-development
releases that we’ve been putting out for the past five years. This is an
important milestone for the project: earlier this year our team switched
almost entirely to validation, documentation, and QA in preparation for
our first production-quality release, currently scheduled for early next
year. R2012a represents a feature-complete preview of that release.

The `General Mission Analysis Tool`_ (GMAT) is a space trajectory
simulation, analysis, and optimization system developed by a team made
up of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and private industry partners. It
is developed as open source under the NASA Open Source Agreement: not
only is the source code for each release available for download, but the
primary development repository is hosted publicly at `SourceForge.net`_.
Here at GSFC, it’s been used as a primary or secondary design tool on
many of our most exciting missions: LCROSS, ARTEMIS, LRO, MMS, OSIRIS,
and others. And externally, it’s been used by entities as varied as the
Air Force Research Lab, Iowa State University, and the European Space
Agency. Contributors to this release included NASA GSFC civil servants,
Thinking Systems Inc., and A.I. Solutions.

The R2012a release offers some exciting improvements from the last year
of development:

-  **Ground track plot**: GMAT can now show a two-dimensional ground
   track of your spacecraft on any planet or celestial body you choose.
-  **Orbit Designer**:Now you can design an (Earth-centered) orbit as
   easily as choosing a type and a small set of defining parameters. For
   example, a geostationary orbit can now be created with just one
   click.
-  **Preview features**: We’ve included previews of an eclipse locator
   feature, which can detect when a spacecraft will enter and exit
   shadow regions, and of a C-language interface to GMAT’s modeling
   features.
-  **Many others**: This version of GMAT includes many smaller
   improvements to its modeling capabilities, performance, and
   usability.

As mentioned above, this is the last of the feature-driven beta versions
that we’ve been releasing since 2007. As of this spring, we’ve switched
almost entirely to quality improvement. We’re making a full sweep
through the system, going feature-by-feature and making sure everything
is spec’d, tested, and documented, all leading to our first production
release this winter. The coming year is going to be an important one for
the project: the production version will open the doors for
collaboration and public engagement far beyond their current levels, and
we’re working hard to get ourselves into a position to take advantage of
that. Look for many changes to GMAT’s public-facing infrastructure and
community development efforts in the coming months.
