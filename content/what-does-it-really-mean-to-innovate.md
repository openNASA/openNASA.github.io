It has been four months since the [International Space Apps Challenge][]
took place.  We are currently in the process of planning a number of
future mass collaboration events and in reflecting back on what we
learned over the past six months, I wanted to share a few words from the
introduction to the [final report][] for the International Space Apps
Challenge.  It really addresses why innovation is so important, why it's
so often bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable, and why it's
so different the normal way we do business.

> **What does it really mean to innovate?**
>
> Innovation at NASA often reveals itself as a single advancement in a
> specific technology. The challenge then lies in reliably repeating the
> act of this advancement. We believe that innovative practices are the
> key to creating and discovering state-of-the-art technology. The
> International Space Apps Challenge sought to bridge the gap between
> innovative technology, and its practice.
>
> In business and government, there currently exists a set of techniques
> for developing new products that has been carried over from the
> industrial age: a large team is pulled together, the budget is
> established, a business model or project plan is created, a detailed
> product road map is developed and rolled out to a user base in phases.
> This process has proven itself many times over and is especially
> important when building an expensive rocket – the tiniest error could
> yield catastrophic failure. Much technological advancement has been
> made through this process. However, these time-tested methods of
> management do not lend well to seasons of uncertainty. Innovation, on
> the other hand, thrives in those seasons.
>
> Innovation is bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable. True
> innovation necessitates failure. The more you experiment, the more you
> fail, the more you learn. Small technologies and initial development
> deserve innovative process and the opportunity for failure.
>
> At the International Space Apps Challenge we opened up challenges of
> space exploration and social need and empowered citizens around the
> world to solve those challenges. This was a bold risk. NASA partnered
> with organizations with whom they had not previously partnered. NASA
> empowered local planners in 24 cities around the world, with the
> vision for contributing to space exploration and social good.
> Passionate citizens were asked to find and share their solutions to
> the challenges. In the process of planning, executing and concluding
> the event we have learned a lot; and recognized the power released
> when we work together with others committed to changing the way the
> world works. With that in mind, this report is to share our
> experience. We experimented with a model for accelerating technology
> and have captured that story here to be built upon. We hope that
> business and government alike can carry the story forward.
