*Is it possible to change the world in 48 hours?  We think so!  *

[Random Hacks of Kindness][] is a rapidly growing global initiative
encompassing a community of over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries
making the world a better place by developing practical, open source
technology solutions to respond to some of the most complex challenges
facing humanity. This is done by defining problems, organizing
hackathons, and ensuring the solutions are effectively deployed. This
weekend, we are hosting another two-day RHoK event in 30 cities and we
have big expectations for what will be accomplished.

This is our 6th global [RHoK][Random Hacks of Kindness] hackathon and
the impact of past RHoK events can not be understated.  RHoK has an
impressive and influential history.  The effort, which is only three
years old, has already resulted in 177 hackathons in 37 different
countries producing thousands of solutions.  There are a number of past
RHoK projects that serve as guiding examples of what's possible in just
48 hours, from those developed in the early days and still in use
like [CHASM][], [Open Street Map Tasking Manager][], Risk-in-a-Box
(now [InaSAFE][]), [First Responde][]r and [Caritas Disaster Mapping][],
as well as [Bushfire Connect ][], to more recent RHoK projects
like [PhillySNAP][], [Sheltr][], [WaterVoices][], [AdHawk][], [Bring the
Food][], [Yo! Philly
Votes][], [Councilmatic][],[FourTeachersProject][] and [Taarifa][].

**New RHoK Challenges**

This weekend, hundreds of new challenges will be tackled, including
problems presented by hackers at each of the 30 events as well as a
diverse set of Featured Problems coming from the [Peace Corps][], [Code
for America][] and the [World Bank's Sanitation Hackathon][].  You can
see all the [feature problems here][] and [all the problems here][].  At
NASA, we are particularly excited about the opportunity presented by the
[Peace Corps Innovation Challenge][] to positively impact the developing
world by developing innovative solutions for the real challenges faced
by Peace Corps Volunteers. We have included an overview of the 10
challenges here and encourage you to use your time this weekend at RHoK
to*"hack for peace"*.

The [Peace Corps Innovation Challenge][] is based on a simple yet
powerful idea:

</div>

</div>

-   Use the on-the-ground knowledge of the over 9,000 Peace Corps
    Volunteers who live and work in some of the most remote areas of the
    developing world to identify and articulate the day-to-day
    challenges.
-   Then, empower talented and concerned citizens from around the world
    to work together to deliver innovative, meaningful, and practical
    solutions.
-   Finally, make these tools easily available to all those living and
    working in the developing world on open-source technology platforms.

**RHoK Accelerator**

If you are one of the teams participating in RHoK and you are interested
in taking your solution farther, check out the [Geeks Without Bounds
accelerator program][].  GWOB will help take teams through a six month
mentorship cycle to bring good intentions to a state of deployment. The
way it works is that if you are selected, you will be connected with
other developers from the global community who can aid in tool learning,
maintenance, and further development. The goal is to improve your
solution and transition it into operation.  You can now apply for our
next round of acceleration, but make sure to get your applications in*by
December 15th*.

**Follow Along Online**

If you are not able to physically participate in a RHoK event this
weekend, you can still follow along online!  Our team will be attending
events in DC, Atlanta, Philadelphia and Rochester and will be providing
live updates of the experience. Here is a video capturing the opening
remarks at the Atlanta location.
