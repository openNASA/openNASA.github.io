Mobile apps have become a regular part of my daily life. It’s safe to say there are enough apps to perform virtually any task you have in mind! I find apps to be a great tool to keep me in touch with friends, daily news, and NASA.

The flagship app for NASA is of course the "[NASA App](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/index.html)", which is available on both iOS and Android platforms, and has been downloaded over 9.9 million times and recently averaged over 2.5 million hits per day.  However, NASA has made a wide variety of interactive apps for mobile users, which range from performing a spacewalk to receiving a notification every time the ISS is right above you. These apps give you an opportunity to stay involved and educated on current and future NASA missions.  Listed below are all 41 of the NASA-related apps for iOS and Android!

Click away and download as many as you can.

**Now *this* is living in the 21st Century!**

It’s amazing to see all the apps that are related to NASA and space, all compressed into one list. As a space lover, I like the apps that feature neat pictures from space or interactive simulations, which tends to be a theme for most of them.

From the list above we can say that (so far) 74% of the apps are iOS and 26% are Android. Although Android continues to grow iOS stands firm and dominates the NASA application list! Find the apps that most interest you, and spark your interest in science and space through them! They're only a _touch_ away.

**This list is definitely not complete - we need your help to make it even more accurate. Do you know of any other apps that should be on this list?  What kind of apps would you like to see?  Let us know in the comments below or email us at opengov@nasa.gov.**
