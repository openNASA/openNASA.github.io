Today we are proud to announce the latest developments for the upcoming
`International Space Apps Challenge`_! Last September, we `announced`_
that we would be hosting the two-day event as part of the United States’
domestic commitments to the `Open Government Partnership`_. Since then,
we have been hard at work planning the collaborative technology
development event during which citizens from around the world will work
together to solve current challenges relevant to both space exploration
and social need.

The International Space Apps Challenge will be held on all seven
continents on April 21-22, 2012. Locations in which events are currently
planned to be held include `San Francisco, US`_; `Tokyo, Japan`_;
`Melbourne`_ and `Canberra, Australia`_; `Jakarta, Indonesia`_;
`Exeter`_ and `Oxford, UK`_; `Nairobi, Kenya`_; `Sao Paulo, Brazil`_;
Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic; and `McMurdo Station, Antarctica`_.

The challenges for the event address both 1) strategic exploration needs
and 2) strategic social need, and are organized into four categories
including: 1) `open source software`_, 2) `open hardware`_, 3) `data
visualization`_, and 4) `citizen science platforms`_. We'll be adding
2-5 new challenges per week to the site between now and the event, so
check back often to join the project teams and related discussion.

We’ve been very fortunate to work with a number of government entities
and other organizations around the world in preparation of today’s
announcement. We are truly thankful for their support.

We anticipate a lot of interest in the event, so makes sure to
`register`_ as soon as possible!  If your organization is interested in
planning an event in your city or offering a challenge to be worked on,
please `contact us`_ as soon as possible.
