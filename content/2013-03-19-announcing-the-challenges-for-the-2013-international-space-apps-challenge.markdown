The [International Space Apps Challenge](http://spaceappschallenge.org) is an international mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over 48-hours in cities [around the world](http://spaceappschallenge.org/locations/). The event embraces collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions. Today, we are announcing the challenges for this years event!  The challenges are focused on improving life on Earth and life in space in the areas of open source software, open hardware, data visualization and citizen science. As we get closer to the event expect more detail, data resources, and content to help you in your work. You can find out more about all the challenges at [http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges](http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges)
