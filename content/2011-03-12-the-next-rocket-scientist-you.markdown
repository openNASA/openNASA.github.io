For over half a century, [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov) has inspired people across the world to [look to the heavens](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and wonder what secrets are hidden within the cosmos. Solving those mysteries has long been the domain of lab-coat wearing scientists in government agencies and universities. However, with the advent of the internet, social web, and open source data, it has become [possible for anyone](http://www.zooniverse.org/) to make scientific discoveries about our [universe](http://www.virgingalactic.com/). Find out how you can actively [contribute to space exploration](https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/NASA) and how the collective power of the internet is enabling the [future of scientific research](http://www.googlelunarxprize.org/).
