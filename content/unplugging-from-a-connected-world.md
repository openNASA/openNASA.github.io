This past week, the founder of the Webby Awards, [Tiffany Schlain][],
presented her most recent work at [TEDxNASA][] in San Francisco.  In the
coming months, her new documentary film “*[Connected: An Autobloggraphy
about Love, Death and Technology][]*” will start to rollout nationwide. 
The OpenGov team had the fortunate opportunity to talk to Tiffany about
what it means to live in an interdependent world and she really got us
thinking about the interdependence of technology, culture, and the world
as we know it.

As Tiffany pointed out, **the single most important thing about
technology is that you can turn it off**.  Think about that for a
minute.  When is the last time you unplugged?  Have you ever unplugged? 
Do you NEED to unplug?

Unplugging is a noble goal. But here’s the challenge: *it seems almost
impossible to do*.  It’s clear that we are rapidly being overcome by the
realities of living in the information age and for many, being
hyper-connected is a fundamental survival technique. To prove her point,
Tiffany asked the TEDxNASA for a show of hands of how many people
regularly unplug one day every week.  Out of the hundreds of people in
attendance, two people raised their hands!  Most people just laughed it
off.

**The amazing thing that happens when you unplug is that time slows
down** and you are “*more present*.” This is something that is becoming
much more important in my own life as my wife and I start to raise our
family.  There just doesn’t seem to be enough time in the day to do
everything I did before, and invest in my family.  At the end of the
day, my family is much more important and the idea of slowing down time,
and being more present, is incredibly attractive.

Last week, I also had an opportunity to watch [Seth Godin][] present
about a very similar topic.  Shortly thereafter he published a blog post
called*"the filter hierarchy*” which really scopes the the problem we
face today.  I’ve cross-posted his article below and would love to know
what you think.

**<span style="text-decoration: underline;">[The Filter
Hierarchy][]</span>**

riffs, causes, meetings, opportunities, viral videos, technologies and

<span style="color: #333399;">Which of these are required reading for a
productive member of society or a good employee or an informed citizen?
Which do you do out of habit? Are you assuming that your habits are the
norm, and that others have an obligation to pay attention to what you
pay attention to? Should there be symmetry--is it logical to only engage
with people who prioritize their filters the same way you do?</span>
