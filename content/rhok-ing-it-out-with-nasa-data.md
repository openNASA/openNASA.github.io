This weekend, 34 cities across the globe will play host to [Random Hacks
of Kindness \#4][]. Random Hacks of Kindness is a community of
innovation that brings together subject matter experts with volunteer
technologists to develop open technology solutions to the global
challenges. NASA has a long history with RHoK - we were one of the
founding core team members and have been involved ever since!

Many of the projects worked on at RHoK rely on critical data about earth
in order to accomplish their goals (such as rainfall analysis,
temperature readings, imagery, etc). NASA's earth science missions
collect terabytes upon terabytes per day of information about our
planet, and we've made it our goal to help RHoK-ers as much as possible
with accessing our data and using it in amazing ways to create apps that
save lives. Here are just a few ways we're working with RHoK this year
to make our data accessible:

**1) data.nasa.gov**  
*<http://data.nasa.gov>*  
We launched data.nasa.gov earlier this year to act as "yellow pages" of
NASA datasets. Since NASA's data is so distributed across the internet,
it's traditionally been incredibly difficult to find the data you needed
unless you knew what you were looking for. data.nasa.gov aims to make
the process of discovering data easier by offering a simple, tagged
index of NASA data resources. If you're really ambitious, you can even
use our [API][] to query the site!

**2) Meet us in person!**  
All five members of NASA's Open Government Team will be on call and
present at different RHoK locations around the country. We'll work to
make ourselves known at the events - feel free to come up to ask
questions, get ideas, or just chat about space! If we can't answer
something, we'll work to find a NASA expert who can.

**3) Tag up with us online  
**We'll all also be available online to help out those RHoK locations
without a NASA-rep, or to help facilitate cross-RHoK event
collaborations. See below for a list of where we'll be and how to
contact us.

**4) Join "The Collaboration Project"  
***<http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/12/01/the-collaboration-project/>*  
The goal of this collaboration is to bring together different
perspectives to create one, simple, user-friendly mechanism to
communicate and collaborate to tackle the challenges facing our world.
By doing that we can all learn from each othersâ€™ successes and mistakes.
[NASA Astronaut Ron Garan][] is spearheading this effort, and will be
presenting on it at RHoK Austin Saturday morning. We'll update this post
with a recording as soon as his talk takes place!
