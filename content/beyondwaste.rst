*This post by Open Government collaborator Beth Beck is crossposted from
her blog `here`_. We hope you'll join us this week and follow along with
the event!*

It’s finally here — `LAUNCH: Beyond Waste`_! We’ve been working for the
last six months to get to this point. We head out to Pasadena,
California this week to hear from nine innovators with creative ways to
create value from discarded products  – plastic bottles, human and plant
waste, unused fabric, and more.

LAUNCH, \ *for those of you who haven’t heard me talk about it before*,
is a social entrepreneurship enterprise that breaks new ground in
public/private partnerships. We created the LAUNCH program three years
ago to address large, sustainability-related challenges that no single
government or commercial entity can solve alone. Our talented \ `LAUNCH
team`_ searches for transformative innovations, which we connect with a
collaborative group of thought leaders and experts which we
call \ `LAUNCH Council`_. LAUNCH Innovators are uniquely poised to
accelerate their innovations for greater impact and scale by leveraging
the advice, networks, and resources of the \ `LAUNCH Council`_ members
and the global stage LAUNCH provides.

**The ultimate goal of LAUNCH is a sustainable future for planet Earth
and her citizens.**

The \ `LAUNCH: Beyond Wast`_\ e forum is the fourth in a series of
challenges, following Water, Health, and Energy. The LAUNCH team focused
on waste as a challenge topic in order to address increasing strain on
the planet’s limited resources. Global citizens, as well as explorers
who leave Earth’s protection, share the need for creative solutions to
the issue of waste — from designing for zero waste to revaluing existing
waste from inefficient production and processes. LAUNCH: Beyond Waste
addresses this global challenge.

I love the tagline from \ `Anshu Gupta of Goonj`_, one of our innovators
from India, who wants to transform the cash society into a trash society
— meaning trash = revenue stream. Our western version: one man’s trash
is another man’s treasure.

Here are the cool movie posters our team (Trish and Lilly) created to
represent each innovation we’ll feature at the forum.

**Attero:** Attero is India’s first low cost, efficient metal extraction
technology for e-waste. With an integrated recycling and refurbishing
facility and proprietary metallurgical processes (patent pending),
Attero is the only end-to-end e-waste recycling company in India.

**`Goonj`_:** Using urban waste streams as a powerful development
resource in rural India, Goonj is dedicated to saving lives, empowering
people, and ensuring dignity for the underserved poor in rural India.
Through its activities, Goonj helps to create a parallel economy that is
not ‘cash based’, but ‘trash based.’

`**Kiverdi:**`_ Kiverdi offers a proprietary bioprocess that recycles
waste carbon from a number of waste streams, including syngas (from
forestry residue and landfills), stranded natural gas or agricultural
residue, to produce drop-in fuels, oils and custom chemicals. Kiverdi’s
industrial scale bioreactor allows the company to transform biomass into
high value industrial products.

`**Pylantis:**`_ Pylantis is a bioplastics company with a proprietary
process that combines organic fillers (waste) with plant plastic resins
to create high waste content injection molded products capable of
withstanding temperatures up to 140C. Pylantis produces a wide variety
of products that provide a commercially viable alternative to
environmentally unsustainable traditional petroleum-based plastic
products.

`**re:char:**`_ re:char’s technology allows farmers worldwide to convert
their waste into biochar, a carbon-negative soil amendment to grow more
food and fight climate change.

**`RecycleMatch`_:** RecycleMatch is the first global on-line
marketplace for recycling that connects waste generators, recyclers, and
manufacturers. The RecycleMatch platform finds the ‘highest and best
use’ for recyclables and ‘waste’ byproducts in the market.

**`Sanergy`_:** Sanergy provides quality sanitation facilities,
efficient and effective waste collection services, and proper waste
treatment in the slums of Kenya.

**`SEaB Energy`_:** SEaB provides companies a turn-key waste to energy
product which uses micro anaerobic digestion to convert organic waste
into energy on-site at the source of the waste generation where the
energy can be utilized continuously.

**`SIRUM`_:** SIRUM disrupts the pharmaceutical supply chain by
redistributing unused, unexpired medicine that would otherwise be
destroyed.
