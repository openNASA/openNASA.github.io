What are you doing on Friday, July 20, 2012? On behalf of the Fragile Oasis team, I invite you to roll up your sleeves and **Do 1 Thing to make life better on this planet we call home.**

July 20th is a special day in the history of humankind. We celebrate the day 43 years ago when two of the Apollo XI astronauts landed on Earth’s moon, and left their footprints on its surface. It is also the day we mark the [second anniversary of fragileoasis.org](http://www.fragileoasis.org/blog/2011/7/thats-one-small-step-for-man/), the catalyst for a growing community of people from all walks of life who look for opportunities to better our communities and our world, making life better for all of us.

In that spirit, let us know what you are doing - the down-to-earth kinds of things people do everyday - bagging trash from a park, reading to children at a public library, helping a neighbor - any individual act when multiplied by others builds the momentum that changes the world bit by bit. [Submit it here ](http://www.fragileoasis.org/projects/nominate)as a special project (select "Do 1 Thing" from the project category choices), upload a picture if you like, and [you'll receive this limited edition Fragile Oasis badge](http://www.fragileoasis.org/badges/community-do/) displayed on your profile.

We have one Fragile Oasis, and 7 billion pairs of hands and hearts, including yours. #Do1T!
