As part of the NASA Open Government plan released on April 7, 2010, NASA
announced more than 150 milestones related to integrating Open
Government into the agencies programs and projects. To celebrate the one
year anniversary of our plan, we’ve released a new infographic to
communicate our first year of progress toward becoming more transparent,
participatory, and collaborative. While we’ve set high goals, we’re
committed to incorporating open government into every facet of our
mission. We have made great progress in some areas; others have taken
longer than we anticipated and extra time is required to fully realize
the goals. We hope this will clearly communicate our progress and keep
you informed of new and exciting things within NASA. All of these goals
are fluid – you’ll see growth and movement as we work to determine the
best path toward openness. If you have any questions or comments, we
encourage you to visit the NASA Open Government Initiative website and
share your ideas.
