						<p><a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">Squares have been appearing on the world map</a> for the past several
months…  there are now so many that some are buried underneath others!
Right now we know of 83 local events planned in 44 countries –
connections on all 7 continents and in&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: <em>what if you live somewhere where you can’t join a
local event?</em> Whether that’s Alaska, Russia, the bottom of the Atlantic
or on the International Space Station, we are committed to engaging the
participation of anyone and everyone who wants to be a part of
addressing exploration challenges. Fortunately, with the aid of
technology, that’s possible. Your city may not have an event this year –
but you can “put it on the map” by volunteering your skills and&nbsp;perspectives!</p>
<p><strong>So what do virtual participants need to know for Space&nbsp;Apps? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Before the&nbsp;Event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Check out <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">challenge pages</a> and figure out what you want to work
    on. You can ask questions and leave comments on the hackpads
    associated with each challenge. (There&#8217;s a blue button on the page
    to get to the hackpad.) Leave a note with your skills and how people
    can contact&nbsp;you.</li>
<li>Invite your friends and colleagues! While we would love to connect
    you with collaborators in other cities, you certainly can bring your
    own collaborators with&nbsp;you.</li>
<li>Connect up with the Virtual Coordinator, <a href="https://twitter.com/wmburke">Wayne Burke</a>! He’s ready
    to help match you with project teams and answer your&nbsp;questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>During the&nbsp;Event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/virtual/">Virtual Location page</a> will be your home base – Wayne will be
    keeping it up to date with contact information, news and whatever
    information you need to&nbsp;know.</li>
<li>Create a project page on spaceappschallenge.org and list your
    collaborators. This will be where you ultimately submit your work&nbsp;online.</li>
<li>Figure out with your team how you want to communicate and what tools
    will work for you.  The key to successful virtual participation is
    solid communication – and so we want to be sure that everyone is
    getting the information they&nbsp;need.</li>
<li>Stay connected with the global event from your location! Watch the
    intro video when it gets posted and stay tuned to the dashboard for
    timeline, Ustream updates, Twitter&nbsp;connections.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>After the&nbsp;Event:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/spaceapps">Watch online for updates</a> on judging of virtual projects and
    nominations for global&nbsp;judging!</li>
</ul>
<p>The International Space Apps Challenge is fundamentally about
collaboration. It takes many nations working together to build the space
station and keep a human presence in space – and it will take many
nations working together to go further and explore beyond. Come be a
part of helping to make that&nbsp;happen.</p>
<p><a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/register/">Sign up here</a> to participate virtually in the International Space
Apps Challenge – and we’ll “see” you next&nbsp;weekend!</p>
