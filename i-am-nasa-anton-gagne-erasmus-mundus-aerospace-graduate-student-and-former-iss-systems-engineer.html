						<p>Fifty or so years ago, a popular science fiction show about space
exploration began airing. Not a novel subject for the 1960’s; however,
it was set apart by the ship’s crew, who at the time were as fictional
as the fantastic voyages undertaken. The plot depicted Americans and
Russians working together at the height of the Cold War; men, women and
people of different races working together as equals at a time when that
was far outside of the norm in much of the <span class="caps">US</span>.</p>
<p>One of Star Trek’s original cast members, George Takei, remarked during
a visit to <span class="caps">NASA</span> Johnson Space Center that our world has (partially)
caught up to the fictional one he starred in and I tend to agree. While
the International Space Station (<span class="caps">ISS</span>) is not travelling the galaxy at
warp speed making contact with new alien species, it is an incredibly
complex engineering feat undertaken by nations from around the globe,
two of the major partners being former Cold War rivals. The
multinational crew living and working on the <span class="caps">ISS</span> is comprised of men and
women from these countries that train together, learn each other’s
languages and have dedicated their lives to furthering the common goal
of space exploration for the good of all&nbsp;mankind.</p>
<p>The discoveries being made possible by the <span class="caps">ISS</span> are giving the world a
treasure trove of information on the intricacies of long duration space
flight; both on the effects of the harsh space environment that the crew
endures and the machines needed to sustain them. It is also providing a
wealth of information through experiments with Earth applications, as
well as observations of the Earth below and the infinitely deep space&nbsp;above.</p>
<p>It has been a privilege to work in the strategic planning team, where I
got the chance to see this cooperation firsthand. I had the opportunity
to be a part of a team planning <span class="caps">ISS</span> logistic support after Shuttle
retirement alongside all of the international partners. I also had the
opportunity to work with many systems experts and our partners to
determine the impacts of possible module relocations, new research
module integration and new ports for the next generation of crew
vehicles that will help this amazing platform remain in orbit long into
the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that humanity’s next great ventures into space
exploration will be international. So far, space has not had an owner.
It belongs to all of mankind and bringing countries together to expand
man’s last frontier brings us all closer together as we look down on the
tiny blue speck and out at the infinite universe around us. Think of how
the Apollo-Soyuz and Mir projects thawed the ice, even so slightly,
between the two countries involved despite the fact that at the time
they were pledging mutual&nbsp;annihilation.</p>
<p>Inspired by my role supporting the <span class="caps">ISS</span>, I hope to remain a part of the
fantastic and boundless field of international space exploration after I
finish my graduate degree, which will hopefully not only give me a
better understanding of aerospace engineering, but also of the way
business is conducted overseas and long term relationships are built
between governments, agencies and&nbsp;businesses.</p>
