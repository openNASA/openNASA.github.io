						<p>I&#8217;m here writing for <span class="caps">NASA</span> because of an internship program for my high
school. That program ends today, so I&#8217;ll be talking about my time here -
telling my own story for once, as it&nbsp;were.</p>
<p>Anyways, as a senior of Staples High School, I have won, as a product of
my years of high school servitude, a month of freedom before graduation
to spend at any internship of my choosing. Through a wonderful amalgam
of kismet, effort, Todd Khozein, and Ali Llewellyn, I began my journey
with the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Innovation&nbsp;team.</p>
<p>I went in to this specific internship in a state of mild
fan-girl-freak-out (it&#8217;s freaking <span class="caps">NASA</span>, man!). To be honest, I&#8217;m not
quite sure what I expected. My imagination was running so fast it
probably could&#8217;ve launched into space. All I knew was that there was the
International Space Apps Challenge, and that I would find some way to
dig into it with hands, feet, and&nbsp;elbows.</p>
<p>Find a way I did. Within the dawn of my first day as an official <span class="caps">NASA</span>
intern, I was enveloped in the Open Innovation Team. My passion is for
telling stories and working with data - it was decided I would become
the team&#8217;s story-miner, responsible for discovering the stories behind
the data and participants of the Space Apps Challenge. (It&#8217;s through
this position I discovered that blogging could be used for Actual
Important Business, and not just funny cat gifs.) In seriousness, it&#8217;s
through being the team&#8217;s story-miner that I discovered that my words are
a medium for spreading innovation. As a seventeen-year-old about to go
off to college to &#8220;make something of myself,&#8221; it&#8217;s a powerful
realization. My time at <span class="caps">NASA</span> transformed my language from a tool I have
used all my life to express my needs and opinions into a sword that I
can use to carve my way in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>All I seemed to need was a push in the right direction, and a
conveniently placed WordPress account - it makes me think that maybe
this sword has been there all my life, but merely sheathed, and my
mentors and friends at open.<span class="caps">NASA</span> were the ones who only showed me how to
pull it out and let it&nbsp;gleam.</p>
<p>As I sit here at the end of my official time with <span class="caps">NASA</span>, I&#8217;m trying to
reflect back on what I&#8217;ve learned. I learned that working from home, as
I had to do from my small Connecticut residence, is both wonderfully
relaxing and strangely challenging. (No, Kiana, you can&#8217;t watch 5
episodes of <em>Supernatural</em> in succession, you have calls to make.) I
learned through the patience of the small yet indomitable Sarah Rigdon
how to use Twitter and navigate the streets of Washington, <span class="caps">D.C.</span> in high
heels. From all-around genius Sean Herron, I saw that deadpan sarcasm
and technological savvy are traits to never be undervalued, and from
&#8220;Jedi Master&#8221; Nick Skytland that yes, it is possible to spend 11 hours
on a plane innovating and creating and still return excited and ready to
continue innovating. (Yeah, I didn&#8217;t believe it at first&nbsp;either.)</p>
<p>From my now-forever mentor, Ali Llewellyn, the things I learned were
both simple and profound. Always discover as many paths to take as
possible, so that you can take the fabled &#8220;one less travelled.&#8221; Hugs are
always appreciated. Just because I&#8217;m only a teenager doesn&#8217;t mean I
can&#8217;t change my own world, and just because it&#8217;s my
own microcosm doesn&#8217;t mean that it can&#8217;t change the macrocosm we call
Earth, or even space. When you talk about meatballs at <span class="caps">NASA</span>, you&#8217;re
probably not referring to Italian food. But most importantly, passion is
what keeps your work alive. Passion is what will revolutionize the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Never let go of that&nbsp;passion.</p>
