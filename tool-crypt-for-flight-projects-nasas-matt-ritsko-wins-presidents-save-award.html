						<p>I recently had a chance to chat with Matt Ritsko, the recent winner of
the President&#8217;s <span class="caps">SAVE</span> Award. The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award/about"><span class="caps">SAVE</span> Award</a>, which stands
for Securing Americans Value and Efficiency, was launched in 2009 by
President Obama. The award seeks ideas from federal employees to make
government more effective and efficient and ensure taxpayer dollars are
spent wisely. Matt is a Financial Manager on the <a href="http://gems.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Gravity Extreme
Magnetism <span class="caps">SMEX</span> (<span class="caps">GEMS</span>)</a> Flight Project at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Goddard Space Flight
Center</a>. <span class="caps">NASA</span> has a <a href="http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/multi/explorer.html">long heritage</a> of launching <a href="http://explorers.gsfc.nasa.gov/smex.html"><span class="caps">SMEX</span> or Small
Explorer</a> missions. There have been over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explorer_program">92 Explorer class
missions</a> launched by <span class="caps">NASA</span>, including <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/explorer1.html">Explorer 1</a>, the first <span class="caps">US</span>
satellite, and <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/cobe/"><span class="caps">COBE</span></a>, whose science won the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/starsgalaxies/nobel_prize_mather.html">Nobel Prize for
Science</a>. <span class="caps">NASA</span> Explorer class missions have the lowest cost of all
<span class="caps">NASA</span> flight missions, which means that the cost and schedule are
typically very aggressive. So a large emphasis is put on creative ways
of saving cost. Join us as we catch up with Matt to hear the background
on his <span class="caps">SAVE</span>&nbsp;Award.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Open <span class="caps">NASA</span></strong>: Welcome Matt, tell us about what its like on a <span class="caps">SMEX</span>
mission and the lead up to submitting your idea to the President&#8217;s <span class="caps">SAVE</span>&nbsp;Award.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Ritsko</strong>: One of the challenges I have on a daily basis is to
look for ways of being as efficient with the resources we have available
to us in terms of staff, materials and time. We are on a very short
schedule and quick turn around to build <a href="http://gems.gsfc.nasa.gov/"><span class="caps">GEMS</span></a>, so we are always looking around Goddard for the right mix
of resources to accomplish the mission. I am very interested in finding
ways of being more&nbsp;efficient.</p>
<p>There are a few flight projects at Goddard which had improved tracking
of parts that they had left over after they launched their mission,
including the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/iss_carriers.html">Express Logistics Carrier</a> launched in 2009, which is
an un-pressurized attached payload for the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">International Space
Station</a>. As part of <span class="caps">GEMS</span>, I wanted to see what parts and tools we
could leverage off these other projects. After seeing what they did with
their internal tracking system, it seemed to make sense to enhance our
tracking of tools, such as benches, lifting slings, and shipping
containers. These items can add up to be pretty significant in cost over
the life-cycle of a <span class="caps">NASA</span> flight project. And when you have as many
<a href="http://fpd.gsfc.nasa.gov/programs.html">in-house projects as you have here at Goddard</a> at one point in time,
those cost savings can become pretty significant. At that point you can
start tying in both parts and tools and get at some great cost savings.
With some support, we can raise the bar for both parts and&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ON</span></strong>: And when you talk about parts, do you mean parts that could fly
in space as&nbsp;well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MR</span></strong>: Yes, spaceflight parts, which are very expensive. There are
sometimes left over parts because in the space world, the time to test
and manufacture parts that can tolerate space is very time consuming and
expensive, so you always need spares on hand if parts fail. We put parts
through harsh testing, so that if its going to fail, it fails on the
ground. If a part fails after we launch it, we are sometimes limited on
ways to fix it. Projects are efficient now with parts; we look for ways
to trade and share parts between projects, but it can be a difficult&nbsp;process.</p>

<p><strong><span class="caps">ON</span></strong>: What are some factors which make that&nbsp;difficult?</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MR</span></strong>: Once a project ends, most of the staff are moving on to the next
job. They do not necessarily have the time to find the homes for extra
spare parts and materials. In the process of these transitions, we often
times have a challenge of keeping track of the paper work associated
with it, which is critical for flight parts. You need to have very
detailed documentation to ensure the proper tests were done and that it
only contains certain materials. Without the paper work, you are
spending extra time and man hours to check these space parts and&nbsp;materials.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ON</span></strong>: So how did you hear about the <span class="caps">SAVE</span>&nbsp;Award?</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MR</span></strong>: I heard about the <span class="caps">SAVE</span> Award program though a Goddard-wide
email. I figured, it will only take a few minutes to submit, so sent it
in. It was a very innocent idea at the time and seemed like a good fit
for <span class="caps">SAVE</span> and could be potentially beneficial for Goddard. I submitted
the idea July 14th. I did not hear anything back until about two months
ago, in September, when I got a call from <span class="caps">OMB</span> that the idea had made the
top ten. What I submitted was pretty simple and generic, so they were
looking for more details and the current state of things. <span class="caps">OMB</span> then down
selected to the top 4, and invited us to a teleconference with the
President (which you can see on the top of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/save-award">main <span class="caps">SAVE</span> Award website
here</a>). That opened up the voting period on these top 4 ideas and on
Friday, November 18th, I received a call from Charlie Bolden, the <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Administrator, on my cell phone informing me that we&nbsp;won.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ON</span></strong>: So that call from Charlie was the first you heard of winning the
<span class="caps">SAVE</span>&nbsp;Award?</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MR</span></strong>: Yes, that&#8217;s the first I heard of it. Charlie was great to talk&nbsp;to.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ON</span></strong>: What are your initial plans to implement the&nbsp;system?</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MR</span></strong>: We anticipate that there will be two pieces of this when we go
to implement it, one part is the tool crypt itself and the other part is
the software to manage the trace-ability. With the tools, you simply
check it in and check it out from the tool crypt. If we are talking
about a specific part to fly on a spacecraft, then you need that flight
hardware paperwork that is attached to it which shows all the tests, the
part source and its materials. We have some subject matter experts
examining some of the details for possible&nbsp;implementation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ON</span></strong>: Great, congratulations on your award and thanks for taking the
time to chat with&nbsp;us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">MR</span></strong>: Thank&nbsp;you.</p>
