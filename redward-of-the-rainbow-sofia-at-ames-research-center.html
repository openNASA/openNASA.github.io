						<p>I was privileged this week to visit the Stratospheric Observatory for
Infrared Astronomy - or <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> - while it was at <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Ames Research
Center</a>. <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> is a Boeing 747 built in 1977 that has been modified to
accomodate a 2.5 meter infrared reflecting telescope. This world-class
airborne observatory that will complement the Hubble, Spitzer, Herschel
and James Webb space telescopes and major Earth-based&nbsp;telescopes.</p>
<p>Flying at altitudes up to 45,000‐feet, <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> observes from above more
than 99 percent of Earth’s atmospheric water vapor, thereby opening
windows to the universe not available from the ground. The
Cassegrain-telescope with Nasmyth focus, with a 2.7 meter
aluminum-coated primary mirror, weighs approximately 20,000 kg. (Its
operating temperature is 240 Kelvin, or -33 degrees Celsius!) The near-,
mid- and far- infrared cameras and comprehensive set of
spectrometers allow us to see further through the dust into the sky with
access to more of the&nbsp;wavelength.</p>
<p><img alt="SOFIA telescope" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/telescope-e1318640260385-991x1024.jpg" title="SOFIA telescope" /></p>
<p><span class="caps">SOFIA</span> is a joint program by <span class="caps">NASA</span> and <span class="caps">DLR</span> Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft- und
Raumfahrt (German Aerospace Center). Completion of systems installation,
integration and flight test operations are being conducted at <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s
Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., from
2007 through 2010. <span class="caps">SOFIA</span>&#8217;s science operations are being planned jointly
by the Universities Space Research Association (<span class="caps">USRA</span>) and the Deutsches
<span class="caps">SOFIA</span> Institut (<span class="caps">DSI</span>) under leadership of the <a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span> Science project</a>
at <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Ames Research Center at Moffett Field near San Jose,&nbsp;Calif.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s cool about <span class="caps">SOFIA</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>We get unique <strong>science data </strong>from the <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> project. Its unique
    capabilities illustrate how massive stars form in different
    environments by distinguishing physical, chemical, and dynamical
    differences between high and low mass star formation regions. <span class="caps">SOFIA</span>
    data will be used to refine accretion and cooling models of
    circumstellar disks, and to study the kinematics, composition, and
    evolution of disks around low‐mass young stellar objects. It also
    extends our study of exoplanets and their formation. (Go <a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/docs/SofiaScienceVision051809-1.pdf">here</a>
    for the science vision statement and <a href="http://www.sofia.usra.edu/Science/science_cases/index.html">here</a> to see some of the
    science cases from the&nbsp;project.)</li>
<li><span class="caps">SOFIA</span> offers unique <strong>flexibility </strong>for deployability, resupply, and
    repair. Its scientific instruments can be exchanged regularly for
    repairs, to accommodate changing science requirements, and to
    incorporate new technologies. These instruments do not need to be
    space qualified. Its &#8220;close to home&#8221; status enables <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> to meet
    dynamic needs more quickly and less&nbsp;expensively.</li>
<li><span class="caps">SOFIA</span> redefines <strong>collaboration</strong>. From the beginning, the project
    was designed physically and administratively to foster partnerships
    between educators and scientists in a research environment - across
    international&nbsp;lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about <span class="caps">SOFIA</span>, follow @SOFIATelescope on Twitter or
check out her mission page <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/page2new_rd.html">here</a>. Wonder what the &#8220;space tweeps&#8221; had
to say about their experience on <span class="caps">SOFIA</span> today? Go <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/search/realtime/%23NASATweetup%20SOFIA">here</a> to see their&nbsp;reflections.</p>
<p><strong>What other kinds of partnerships could advance <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s science
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/big-questions/">goals</a>? What would you build or create with that kind of&nbsp;data?</strong></p>
