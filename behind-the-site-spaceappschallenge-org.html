						<p>If you follow openNASA, you’ve no doubt heard of the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">International
Space Apps Challenge</a> – our global codeathon taking place on all seven
continents and in space next month. Last month, we launched a new
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">website</a> for the Challenge that
allows visitors to sign up for events, view and submit challenges, and
learn more about the event. We put a lot of effort in to making it
cutting edge by using the latest web technologies and standards to
provide an excellent user experience. This post will showcase just some
of the methods we used to make the site, and give you some ideas for
creating one&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Screen-shot-2012-03-23-at-2.09.24-AM-300x241.png" title="Screen shot 2012-03-23 at 2.09.24 AM" />][]</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Methodology</strong></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges in creating the site was that, due to our
global audience, we had to ensure the site is compatible and accessible
across a wide range of devices, screen sizes, and internet speeds. The
site is fully responsive, meaning that by using some <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span>
trickery, we’re able to serve up different designs depending on the
user’s screen size. Try it now – visit
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">spaceappschallenge.org</a> on a
smartphone and a desktop at the same time. You’ll see two different
designs, even though each uses the same <span class="caps">HTML</span>&nbsp;files.</p>
<p>Responsive design is becoming increasingly important on the web as more
and more users access websites using smartphones, tablets, and other
small devices. By optimizing the site to a range of user experiences, we
don’t lock people in to viewing a design best suited for a desktop&nbsp;monitor.</p>
<p>The site also makes much use of the <span class="caps">HTML5</span> and <span class="caps">CSS3</span> standards. <span class="caps">CSS3</span>
allows us to duplicate a lot of the design features that previously
required images, meaning that pages load faster and our design is more
flexible. The framework of the site is built off of a combination of the
<a href="http://getskelton.com">Skelton</a> flexible grid system, with some design elements taken from
<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. We also make use of <a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>, which
allows us to use a webfont for icons rather than images. By using these
forward-leaning practices, we can considerably cut down on file sizes
and offer a faster and more accessible experience to&nbsp;visitors.</p>
<p>Accessibility for us also meant making the site available in as many
different ways as possible. For instance, much of our content is encoded
in <a href="http://microformats.org/">Microformats</a>, which extends our <span class="caps">HTML</span> in a semantic way to be
understandable by machines. Additionally, we&#8217;re working with our
location partners to offer translations of content where appropriate.
The Tokyo location, for instance, offers a <a href="http://tokyo.spaceappschallenge.org">Japanese translation</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;Backend</strong></p>
<p>Apart from our design philosophy, we also strived to create a backend
system that enables flexibility, stability, and performance. The site is
hosted on a cloud platform running Linux and powered by <a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx</a> and
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a>. While our sites have traditionally run on <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>,
we decided to go with a Django-based platform. This is due to some of
the particular needs of the site, such as event registration and project
collaboration. We utilize extensive server-side caching to improve
performance and automatically compress and minify our <span class="caps">HTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span>, and
Javascript. On the design side, our templates were styled using <a href="http://lesscss.org"><span class="caps">LESS</span></a>
and we used the helpLESS library to help us do some common tasks more&nbsp;effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Design&nbsp;Philosophy</strong></p>
<p>Ultimately, the technologies and methodologies I have written about are
the things that the end-user is least likely to care about. On the web,
design is paramount. We wanted the Apps Challenge site to be visually
striking and immediately impart a sense of global collaboration to the
visitor. We spent a lot of effort on creating the main design element on
the front page - the map of the world with tags for every location where
the Space Apps Challenge is taking place. Now, doing this with a map of
the Earth is pretty easy (which is lucky, because we&#8217;ve been adding
locations left and right recently!). The difficult part is showing the
highest and fastest-moving location: the International Space Station. We
first experimented with just showing a static icon of the station over
the pacific ocean. Pretty boring. We decided it had to be animated and
move across the screen. Here&#8217;s a little secret, however: the station
does not actually show up where it really is on the planet. We
experimented with making the image live-update as the station crossed
over the globe, but ultimately decided not to for a few&nbsp;reasons:</p>
<p>​1) The code required to do so would be much heavier than we were
willing to put on the site.<br />
2) The projection of the map on the homepage is slightly different than
the projections of most orbital tracks posted by <span class="caps">NASA</span>, meaning that we
would have had to translate coordinates to our projection.<br />
3) The station would have moved realllllly slowly on the screen. Most
users probably wouldn&#8217;t have even noticed&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Thus, we made a small sacrifice - instead, the station follows an
orbital-like wave across the map using jQuery animation and the <a href="https://github.com/weepy/jquery.path">path
plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the homepage, we focused on making the site lightweight but
incorporating design elements that reinforce that feeling of global
collaboration - Google Maps integration, for&nbsp;instance.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>I hope this post has given you at least a glimpse into our web
philosophy and the direction in which we see taking our other properties
(<a href="open.nasa.gov">open.nasa.gov</a>, <a href="data.nasa.gov">data.nasa.gov</a>, and <a href="code.nasa.gov">code.nasa.gov</a>) in the
future. We see the recent trend of accessible <span class="amp">&amp;</span> responsive design as
critical to the next generation of web experiences. Our goal is to make
our content as open, accessible, and flexible as possible. We are open
to feedback and ideas about how we can further this even more - please
leave a comment and let us know what you think! Finally, none of what
we&#8217;ve accomplished on the site would have been possible without the help
of everyone on the Space Apps Challenge team, including Kristen
Painting, Ali Llewellyn, Nick Skytland, Elizabeth Sabet, Chris Gerty,
and William Eshagh. William was core in creating the backend of the site
to go along with the frontend I developed - without him, we&#8217;d have no
django, no server, and no&nbsp;site.</p>
