						<p>It has been four months since the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>
took place.  We are currently in the process of planning a number of
future mass collaboration events and in reflecting back on what we
learned over the past six months, I wanted to share a few words from the
introduction to the <a href="http://goo.gl/QR3Em">final report</a> for the International Space Apps
Challenge.  It really addresses why innovation is so important, why it&#8217;s
so often bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable, and why it&#8217;s
so different the normal way we do&nbsp;business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What does it really mean to&nbsp;innovate?</strong></p>
<p>Innovation at <span class="caps">NASA</span> often reveals itself as a single advancement in a
specific technology. The challenge then lies in reliably repeating the
act of this advancement. We believe that innovative practices are the
key to creating and discovering state-of-the-art technology. The
International Space Apps Challenge sought to bridge the gap between
innovative technology, and its&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>In business and government, there currently exists a set of techniques
for developing new products that has been carried over from the
industrial age: a large team is pulled together, the budget is
established, a business model or project plan is created, a detailed
product road map is developed and rolled out to a user base in phases.
This process has proven itself many times over and is especially
important when building an expensive rocket – the tiniest error could
yield catastrophic failure. Much technological advancement has been
made through this process. However, these time-tested methods of
management do not lend well to seasons of uncertainty. Innovation, on
the other hand, thrives in those&nbsp;seasons.</p>
<p>Innovation is bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable. True
innovation necessitates failure. The more you experiment, the more you
fail, the more you learn. Small technologies and initial development
deserve innovative process and the opportunity for&nbsp;failure.</p>
<p>At the International Space Apps Challenge we opened up challenges of
space exploration and social need and empowered citizens around the
world to solve those challenges. This was a bold risk. <span class="caps">NASA</span> partnered
with organizations with whom they had not previously partnered. <span class="caps">NASA</span>
empowered local planners in 24 cities around the world, with the
vision for contributing to space exploration and social good.
Passionate citizens were asked to find and share their solutions to
the challenges. In the process of planning, executing and concluding
the event we have learned a lot; and recognized the power released
when we work together with others committed to changing the way the
world works. With that in mind, this report is to share our
experience. We experimented with a model for accelerating technology
and have captured that story here to be built upon. We hope that
business and government alike can carry the story&nbsp;forward.</p>
