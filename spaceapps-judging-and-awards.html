						<p>Now to answer two very important&nbsp;questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How will judging&nbsp;work?</li>
<li>Will there be&nbsp;awards?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me first emphasize one *very* important point - the International
Space Apps Challenge is not about competition, it&#8217;s about collaboration.
It takes many nations working together to build the space station and
keep a human presence in space – and it will take many nations working
together to go further and explore beyond. As one local lead noted,
&#8220;It&#8217;s not about the awards - it&#8217;s about being part of something
important. We have the skills and we want to share&nbsp;them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we anticipate amazing results from this weekend and we
want to honor exceptional work and the teams who performed it. So here
is the&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Judging</strong></p>
<p>To be considered for judging, you must register at
spaceappschallenge.org and submit a project by the end of the two-day
local event. Remember that the most vital consideration at this point is
documenting your work well on spaceappschallenge.org and ensure that it
has as much information as possible, including code repositories and all
participating team members.  If you developed software, you must submit
a link to your code to be included in global judging or you will be&nbsp;disqualified.</p>
<p>Judging will take place at every local event (including at the &#8220;virtual&#8221;
location), as well as at a global level. Although we provide standard
judging criteria to each local lead, the judging process at each
location is at the discretion of the local lead. In most cases, the
organizer of each event will convene a judging panel at the conclusion
of the two-day hackathon and the panel will identify the top solutions.
The local lead will then nominate two solutions for global&nbsp;recognition.</p>
<p>A total of 168 solutions will make it to the global judging round. Each
team nominated for global recognition will be required to produce a
short 2 minute video explaining their solution and embed the video onto
their challenge page. We highly encourage you to make the video as
creative as possible. If you need a good example, check out the winners
from last year! You will have until May 1, 2013 to submit a video
describing your challenge and&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>A panel of judges consisting of representatives from <span class="caps">NASA</span> and other
governmental and non-governmental organizations will evaluate the top
solutions nominated by the local leads and select the best in class in
the following&nbsp;categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Use of Data - The solution that best makes space data
    accessible or leverages it to a unique purpose /&nbsp;application.</li>
<li>Best Use of Hardware - The solution that exemplifies the most
    innovative use of&nbsp;hardware.</li>
<li>Galactic Impact - The solution that has the most potential to
    significantly improve life on Earth or in the&nbsp;universe.</li>
<li>Most Inspiring - The solution that captured our hearts and&nbsp;attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the top four best in class awards, there will also be an
award for the solution that has the most public votes . The People&#8217;s
Choice award will be determined from a public voting process facilitated
through the spaceappschallenge.org&nbsp;website.</p>
<ul>
<li>People’s Choice - Determined from a public voting process facilited
    through the spaceappschallenge.org&nbsp;website.</li>
</ul>
<p>The winners will be announced on the spaceappschallenge.org and
open.<span class="caps">NASA</span> blog on May&nbsp;22.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;Awards</strong></p>
<p>Awards may be offered at each local event by organizations who wish to
incentivize work on their challenges or at their location. Additionally,
awards will be offered at the global&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>Examples of what might be offered at local events or by challenge&nbsp;owners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local awards offered at various locations at the discretion of the
    local organizer. For example, the National Aerospace Training and
    Research (<span class="caps">NASTAR</span>) Center will offer personal space training flight
    suits to the top solutions at the Philadelphia&nbsp;location.</li>
<li><span class="caps">ESA</span> will offer an open source RepRap printer, custom trophies and
    diplomas for the top solutions to the 3D Printing&nbsp;Challenge.</li>
<li><span class="caps">NASA</span> Kennedy Space Center will offer 5-7 launch passes for the top
    solutions to the <span class="caps">KSC</span> sponsored challenges (Kennedy Space Center
    2040, Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Deployable
    Greenhouse). <a href="http://spaceappsksc.tumblr.com/post/48201598539/kennedy-space-center-to-invite-ksc-space-apps-winners">More information</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following awards will be offered at the global level (additional
details&nbsp;below):</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="caps">NASA</span> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mars">Mars Exploration Program</a> will offer launch invitations to
    the upcoming <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/maven/"><span class="caps">MAVEN</span></a> launch on 18 November 2013 for the 5 best in
    class award winners (5 invitations per project, travel expenses are
    not&nbsp;included)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.nastarcenter.com/">National Aerospace Training and Research (<span class="caps">NASTAR</span>) Center</a>will
    offer Spaceflight Training packages to the 5 best in class award&nbsp;winners.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all great events, terms and conditions will apply and additional
details* will be communicated after winners have been identified. <span class="caps">NASA</span>,
of course, reserves the right to cancel launch invitations at any time
at its own&nbsp;discretion.</p>
<p><strong>*Additional&nbsp;Details</strong></p>
<p>More details are included below regarding the global awards from <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Mars Exploration Program and <span class="caps">NASTAR</span>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Mars Exploration Program
Global&nbsp;Award</span></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mars">Mars Exploration Program</a> will extend invitations for a launch
viewing opportunity to the global winners at the 2013 International
Space Apps Challenge in the following&nbsp;categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Use of&nbsp;Data</li>
<li>Best Use of&nbsp;Hardware</li>
<li>Most&nbsp;Inspiring</li>
<li>Galactic&nbsp;Impact</li>
<li>People’s&nbsp;Choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the five best in class winning teams will receive invitations to
the Kennedy Space Center (<span class="caps">KSC</span>) to view the <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/maven/">Mars Atmosphere and Volatile
Evolution Mission (<span class="caps">MAVEN</span>)</a> launch. Each team can designate up to
5 team members to receive launch invitations as a <span class="caps">NASA</span> invited guest.
The invitation is for those team members plus one additional guest each
and is non-transferrable. The invitations are available for <span class="caps">U.S.
</span>citizens as well as non-<span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizens; all non-<span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizens must be
approved by <span class="caps">NASA</span> security 45 days prior to the launch. All guests will
be responsible for their own transportation and any costs incurred to
attend the launch&nbsp;viewing.</p>
<p>The teams will also have an opportunity to meet with Mars Exploration
Program and <span class="caps">MAVEN</span> (@MAVEN2Mars) team members. The <span class="caps">MAVEN</span> mission will
explore the planet’s upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with
the sun and solar wind. Scientists will use <span class="caps">MAVEN</span> data to determine the
role that loss of volatile compounds—such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and water—from the Mars atmosphere to space has played through
time, giving insight into the history of Mars atmosphere and climate,
liquid water, and planetary&nbsp;habitability.</p>
<p>The team must designate the five team members within 30 days after the
global winners have been announced. All team members must be listed on
the submitted solution on spaceappschallenge.org. The winning solutions
are expected to be announced on May&nbsp;22nd.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions will apply; additional details will be communicated
after winners have been identified. <span class="caps">NASA</span> reserves the right to cancel
this invitation at any time at its own&nbsp;discretion.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2. National Aerospace Training
and Research (<span class="caps">NASTAR</span>) Center&nbsp;Award</span></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nastarcenter.com/"><span class="caps">NASTAR</span> Center</a> is the premier <span class="caps">FAA</span> approved commercial aviation and space
training, research, and educational center located just outside
Philadelphia, <span class="caps">PA</span>; and is both a local and global supporter of the 2013
International Space Apps Challenge. <span class="caps">NASTAR</span> Center will award each of the
five solution team winners a fully paid Introduction to Spaceflight
Training Course where participants will experience firsthand what it is
like to be an Astronaut for a day. The Introduction to Space course
(valued at \$500) teaches commercial spaceflight training tips,
techniques, and applications to interested and future commercial
astronaut candidates, and culminates in an “out-of-this world” full
spaceflight mission launch to reentry simulation (up to 3Gs!) using the
world’s most high performance spaceflight simulator, the Phoenix
Centrifuge. For more information, visit www.nastarcenter.com or check
out the online&nbsp;brochure.</p>
<p>The award is good for one person and is valid for one year from date of
issue (see available program dates on www.nastarcenter.com). The award
is transferable to another person, but cannot be applied toward another
<span class="caps">NASTAR</span> Center program. <span class="caps">NASTAR</span> Center programs are available to <span class="caps">U.S.
</span>citizens and non-<span class="caps">U.S.</span> citizens. All guests will be responsible for their
own transportation and any costs incurred to attend <span class="caps">NASTAR</span> Center&nbsp;training.</p>
<p>Participation in the <span class="caps">NASTAR</span> Center programs is for participants 18 years
and over. The team members must be listed on the submitted solution on
spaceappschallenge.org. Team members must designate the five <span class="caps">NASTAR</span>
Center training participants within 30 days after the global winners
have been announced. The winning solutions are expected to be announced
