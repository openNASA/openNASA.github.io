						<p><em><a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a> collaborator <a href="https://twitter.com/brennan_mike">Michael Brennan</a>
shares here about how physical and virtual participants can get started
with the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">50 carefully curated challenges</a> for the upcoming global&nbsp;Challenge!</em></p>
<p>One of the things we are most proud of with the 2013 International Space
Apps Challenge is the wealth high <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">quality problem definitions</a> that we have cultivated with dozens of
partners from inside and outside <span class="caps">NASA</span>. But that leave us with an
additional challenge on top of it all - where does one even&nbsp;start?</p>
<p>Start with what interests <span class="caps">YOU</span>. We believe there is something for
everyone in this challenge set, whether you are a <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/backyard-poultry-farmer">backyard farmer</a>, a
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/no-delays-air-traffic-management">future air traffic controller</a>, or future <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry">space-faring
entrepreneur</a>. No matter what your skillset is or your weekend goals
are, you cannot go wrong by working with a topic that interests you.
Most of these challenges have enough breadth do them that you can
identify a piece that is interesting to you regardless of your
background. See a challenge where you like the topic but you&#8217;re not
quite sure how you would fit in? Leave a comment for others to see! And
when you arrive at your local event, identify others who might be
interested in that&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<p>When reviewing a challenge that might interest you, think about how
you&#8217;d like to spend your weekend. Do you like being told exactly what
needs to get done, down to the most comprehensive detail so you can
ensure maximum impact? We have <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/earth-from-space/">challenges</a> <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/scistarter-citizen-science/">for</a> <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/soil-testing-kit/">you</a>. Your
skills added to a well-defined project with clear needs can greatly
increase the likelihood that your work will have a direct impact on our
world. Do you like a big, open-ended challenge that lets you flex your
creative muscle for a solution that reaches for the stars? We have
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/space-station-benefits-to-humanity/">those</a> <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/why-we-explore/">challenges</a>, <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/we-love-data/">too</a>. The open-ended challenges can be
wonderful learning experiences and creative exercises and it is from
those challenges that we often see the biggest game-changers that we
could never have predicted! That is the wonderful value of massive
collaboration around the globe with like-minded scientists, hackers and&nbsp;innovators.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll also notice that there are four challenge categories: Software,
Hardware, Citizen Science, and Data Visualization. This is a good
initial starting point, but don&#8217;t be fooled by these tags! A &#8220;hardware&#8221;
challenge may have software components. A &#8220;software&#8221; challenge may have
a data visualization&nbsp;sub-challenge.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review some of the take-away points here on how to&nbsp;engage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Focus on topics that interest you&nbsp;personally.</li>
<li>Figure out if you want to work on highly defined challenges, or ones
    that are more&nbsp;open-ended.</li>
<li>Utilize the four categories to help narrow down options, but don&#8217;t
    be constrained by&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Think creatively about how your skills and interests can be applied
    to the problems that seem most appealing to&nbsp;you.</li>
<li>Discuss with your peers - both virtually and at events - about how
    you can collaborate together on solving these&nbsp;challenges.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can&#8217;t wait to see what you come up&nbsp;with!  </p>
