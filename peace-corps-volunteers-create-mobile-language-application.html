						<p>At <a href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/peace-corps-innovation-challenge-featured-problems">RHoK</a> in December 2012, we introduced &#8220;<em>featured problem sets</em>&#8221; in
an effort to create stronger and more refined challenges. The first
featured problem set was offered by the Peace Corps as part of it&#8217;s
&#8220;<em>Innovation Challenge</em>.&#8221; The Peace Corps Innovation Challenge is a
worldwide collaboration to develop innovative solutions for the real
challenges faced by people throughout the developing world as identified
and articulated by Peace Corps Volunteers. Today they announced that
they will be doing a second Innovation Challenge and are seeking
submissions of relevant problems through their <a href="http://innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov/">website</a>. The
submitted problems statements will then be reviewed and voted on by
current and returned volunteers, Peace Corps staff, technology experts
and entrepreneurs. The best problems will be offered at a hackathon in
June 2013. Below is their press release, which describes one of the top
solutions from the first Innovation Challenge - a Mobile Language
Application developed by Zambian software developers that translates
English words and phrases into one of seven languages spoken in Zambia.
The app, Bantu Babel, is now available for Android compatible devices in
the Google Play store.  The <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Innovation Program team worked
closely with the Peace Corps on their first Innovation Challenge and
continue to exchange best practices around effective mass collaborations
like&nbsp;this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">WASHINGTON</span>, D.C., April 1, 2013 – Peace Corps volunteers, working
closely with Zambian software developers, have developed a mobile
application that will translate English words and phrases into one of
seven languages spoken in Zambia. Bantu Babel is now available for
Android compatible devices in the Google Play&nbsp;store.</p>
<p>The app is intended to help Peace Corps volunteers, international aid
workers, and host country nationals communicate more effectively. The
app has two parts: a dictionary for translating individual words, and
a survival phrasebook which contains helpful terms for accommodation,
shopping, food and emergencies, among others. Bantu Babel, which can
be used as a training tool for government and aid workers or as a
supplement to formal language training, runs offline eliminating the
need for an internet&nbsp;connection.</p>
<p>“<em>Peace Corps has a phenomenal language training program and to be
able to share it is both exciting and inspiring, and to be able
realize a solution in collaboration with host country nationals truly
embodies the spirit of Peace Corps</em>,” said Tony Tseng, a third year
volunteer from Sacramento,&nbsp;California.</p>
<p>Peace Corps volunteers Tony Tseng, Melissa Stetler, and Rasa Kent
worked with developers from BongoHive, a Lusaka-based technology and
innovation hub to develop the app. BongoHive provides a place for the
local tech community to meet, swap experience, and attend training,
networking and hackathon&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>“<em>It is my belief that Zambia, like many other developing countries,
is in a great position to leapfrog over traditional technology
infrastructures. Almost all Zambians own a cell phone and the market
for mobile applications is growing. To be able to utilize the mobile
phones already in use is a new approach to development that has proven
to be successful in other countries across Africa</em>,” said&nbsp;Tseng.</p>
<p>The framework for the program was developed during a two-day
“hackathon” in December 2012 in Lusaka, part of the Random Hacks of
Kindness (RHoK) global hackathon that included participants in 32
cities and 16 different countries. RHoK’s mission is to create a
self-sustaining global community of innovators building practical open
technology for a better world, and to ensure their work creates impact
in&nbsp;society.</p>
<p>The Peace Corps participated in this worldwide event by collecting
ideas for problems and solutions through the Peace Corps Innovation
Challenge. Peace Corps is again seeking submissions of relevant
problems through the Innovation Challenge website. Problems will be
reviewed and voted on by current and returned volunteers, Peace Corps
staff, technology experts and entrepreneurs. Once problems are
reviewed and refined, technology experts will team up to develop
solutions during the next hackathon in&nbsp;June.</p>
<p><em>About Peace Corps/Zambia: Nearly 1,435 Peace Corps volunteers have
served in Zambia since the program was established in 1993. Currently,
284 volunteers serve in Zambia. Volunteers work in the areas of
education, community development, environment, agriculture, health and
business. Volunteers are trained and work in the following languages:
Bemba, Kaonde, Lunda, Mambwe, Nyanja, Tonga and&nbsp;Tumbuka.</em></p>
<p><em>About the Peace Corps: Since President John F. Kennedy established
the Peace Corps by executive order on March 1, 1961, more than 210,000
Americans have served in 139 host countries. Today, 8,073 volunteers
are working with local communities in 76 host countries in
agriculture, community economic development, education, environment,
health and youth in development. Peace Corps volunteers must be <span class="caps">U.S.
</span>citizens and at least 18 years of age. Peace Corps service is a
27-month commitment and the agency’s mission is to promote world peace
and friendship and a better understanding between Americans and people
of other countries. Visit www.peacecorps.gov for more&nbsp;information.</em></p>
