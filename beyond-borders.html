						<p>Demonstrating the unique skillsets acquired by rocket scientists and
engineers supporting human space exploration, members of <a href="http://www.ewb-jsc.org/">Engineers
Without Borders- Johnson Space Center (<span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">JSC</span>)</a> actively translate
their expertise to real world problems in remote areas. This association
of Johnson Space Center (<span class="caps">JSC</span>) employees, contractors, and other
professionals in the Houston/Clear Lake area volunteer their time to
participate in the projects and efforts of <a href="http://www.ewb-usa.org/">Engineers Without
Borders-<span class="caps">USA</span></a>, a non-profit organization established in 2000 to help
developing areas worldwide with their engineering needs, while involving
and training a new kind of internationally responsible engineer. <span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">USA</span>
projects involve the design and construction of sustainable water,
waste-water, sanitation, energy, and shelter systems. These projects,
initiated by the host community, are jointly designed between the
<span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">USA</span> chapters with input from the community.  Participation in
<span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">JSC</span> is purely volunteer based on members&#8217; own time, and is not
directly endorsed or supported by the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (<span class="caps">NASA</span>).</p>
<p>Recently I had the honor of interviewing Tyler Blair-Sheppard, a co-lead
for a priority <span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">JSC</span> project, the design and implementation of a fruit
drying system for an orphanage in Rwanda seeking economic&nbsp;stability.</p>
<p><strong>What do you do for <span class="caps">NASA</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I am the <a href="http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/sts_eclss.html">Environmental Control and Life Support Systems Flight
Controller</a> for the<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html">International Space Station</a>. The easiest way to
explain my job is that in space, we have to reproduce everything that
the Earth does for us; recycle water for the crew to drink, produce
oxygen for them to breathe, remove carbon dioxide from the air. My team
manages that system from the ground so the crew can focus on operating
the <span class="caps">ISS</span> as a science&nbsp;facility.</p>
<p><strong>When and why did you join <span class="caps">EWB</span>?</strong></p>
<p>I joined <span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">JSC</span> in December of 2008 because I wanted to be able to
apply my knowledge and experience to problems in the developing&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><strong>Role in <span class="caps">EWB</span>-<span class="caps">JSC</span></strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a project lead for our <a href="http://www.ewb-jsc.org/projects/rwanda.html">Rwanda Project</a>, where we&#8217;re developing a
sustainable fruit drying system for <a href="http://lesperancerwanda.org/">L’ Esperance Children’s Village</a>
in Rwanda, so they can sell the fruit abroad. The hope is that the
orphanage will be able to create their own income source, and remove
themselves from the seemingly endless cycle of donations eventually that
run out. It’s all about a sustainable income model; if they can start a
business where the profits pay for the children&#8217;s healthcare and food,
the operations of the orphanage and then send the children to school and
then provide scholarships for university, so they can establish a new
model of sustainable&nbsp;development.</p>
<p><strong>Describe the connection between rural developing communities and space&nbsp;exploration.</strong></p>
<p>Very often developing communities exist on the margins of resource
availability. Lack of access to clean water is a huge problem in the
developing world, as is are meeting basic sanitation needs. The
community in Rwanda where the orphanage is doesn&#8217;t have access to an
electrical grid. In many ways, issues within the developing world
parallel those in space; scarce or very strained resources for
sustaining life. <span class="caps">NASA</span> has a strong history of developing technology to
sustain life in space. Much of that technology is applicable here on
Earth to sustainably improve life in the developing&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><strong>How does what you do for <span class="caps">NASA</span> relate to what you do for <span class="caps">EWB</span>?</strong></p>
<p>Maintaining life in space is probably one of the most difficult things
<span class="caps">NASA</span> does. Much of it has to do with using resources as efficiently as
possible. <span class="caps">EWB</span> applies the same logic to work here on&nbsp;Earth.</p>
<p><strong>Name 5 uses for Duct&nbsp;Tape.</strong></p>
<p>I once used it to fix a pipe in my bathroom while living in China. You
really can do just about anything with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to I have to be a rocket scientist to join Engineers Without&nbsp;Borders?</strong></p>
<p>There are a long list of people who made a difference before we even had
rockets, so the answer is pretty solidly&nbsp;no.</p>
<p><strong>What others applications between exploration and developing
communities can you identify? Share your thoughts and ideas in the
comments space&nbsp;below!</strong></p>
