						<p><em>This article is cross-posted from <span class="caps">ESA</span>&#8217;s Living Planet Program blog
<a href="http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEMIQOBXH3H_LPgmes_0.html">here</a>. For more information about the App Camp, go to the main page
<a href="http://www.app-camp.eu/">here</a>. </em></p>
<p>This week’s <span class="caps">ESA</span> App Camp didn’t see canoeing or campfires. Developers
worked diligently despite the Mediterranean heat to create applications
for mobile phones that bring Earth observation and <span class="caps">GMES</span> services to the
everyday&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>Ending today at <span class="caps">ESRIN</span>, <span class="caps">ESA</span>’s centre for Earth observation, in Frascati,
Italy, 21 developers from 17 <span class="caps">ESA</span> and <span class="caps">EU</span> Member States spent the week
creating mobile applications – or apps – using satellite&nbsp;data.</p>
<p>The goal was to come up with some innovative and off the beaten track
ideas for apps using Earth-monitoring data on smartphones, in particular
by calling on the possibilities offered by the Global Monitoring for
Environment and Security (<span class="caps">GMES</span>)&nbsp;programme.</p>
<p>In groups of four, each team worked to create an app under the following
categories: <span class="caps">GMES</span> for Everyday Life, Observe and Learn, Play the GaMES
and Discovering Climate Change with <span class="caps">GMES</span>.</p>
<p>On a balmy Friday afternoon, developers of the ShareAware app won the
challenge. Their app aims to interconnect people concerned about the
environment to understand, learn about, be prepared for or react to
various events or remote sensing&nbsp;results.</p>
<p>Organised by environmental ‘themes’, such as water, air quality,
deforestation or disasters, users could browse the datasets and report
on a certain issue relevant for that theme and location – a&nbsp;‘callout’.</p>
<p>Users could write a short message or post an image in their callouts.
<span class="caps">GMES</span> products would also be made available for reference in the various
thematic&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p>Members of the winning team were each presented with an&nbsp;iPad3.</p>
<p>The other apps developed during the week included the educational app
GEOLife that shows how Earth observation data can affect our daily
lives. TeakGuard aims to protect rainforests from illegal logging,
4Sense is in the game category and EnviSim attempts to simulate the
effect of policy decisions and technical developments on Earth’s climate
and&nbsp;environment.</p>
<p>Participants of the App Camp are encouraged to submit their apps to the
<span class="caps">ESA</span> App Challenge by 16 September for the chance to win support by one
of the seven <span class="caps">ESA</span> Business Incubation Centres, valued at €60&nbsp;000.</p>
<p>The App Challenge is an initiative of <span class="caps">ESA</span>’s <span class="caps">GMES</span> Space Office to promote
awareness of <span class="caps">GMES</span> to a wider community. It complements the <span class="caps">GMES</span> Master
Prize competition, which awards prizes for the best projects and
business ideas involving commercial <span class="caps">GMES</span> applications. It supports the
development of market-oriented applications that use data from the&nbsp;programme.</p>
<p>The App Camp was devised by the <span class="caps">GMES</span> Space Office and co-sponsored by
the Technology Transfer Programme&nbsp;Office.</p>
