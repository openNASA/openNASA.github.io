						<p><em><span class="caps">NASA</span> is privileged to serve as a founding partner in <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random Hacks of
Kindness</a>, a self-sustaining global community of innovators building
practical open technology for a better world, and committed to ensuring
their work creates impact in society. The first student-focused RHoK
community event (grades 4-8) is planned for this May, and we are excited
to explore the overlaps between mass collaborations, <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/technology-accelerators/">technology
acceleration</a> and our <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/about/index.html"><span class="caps">STEM</span> education goals</a>. Event lead <a href="a%20href=&quot;mailto:pgans@fraserwoods.com&gt;Patrice%20Gans&lt;/a">Patrice
Gans</a> shares below about her vision for RHoK&nbsp;Jr. </em></p>
<p>In the wake of recent tragic events, it has become more important than
ever for young people to feel empowered to make a difference in their
community. With this goal in mind, Fraser Woods Montessori School in
Newtown, <span class="caps">CT</span> is presenting <a href="http://www.rhok.org/event/rhok-junior">Random Hacks of Kindness Junior</a>. The
event, which will take place on Saturday, May 4, 2013, offers elementary
school students (4th – 8th grade) from across Connecticut the
opportunity to explore the power of computing by developing technical
solutions to practical&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>Random Hacks of Kindness Junior (RHoKJr) will bring together technology
experts (university professors, college students, high school teachers
and students) and elementary students to create Smartphone Apps,
websites or educational games to help local&nbsp;causes.</p>
<p>Patterned after the global event, Random Hacks of Kindness
(www.rhok.org), whose mission is to create a self-sustaining global
community of innovators building practical open technology for a better
world, and to ensure their work creates impact in society, participants
will work directly with local stake holders to create real world&nbsp;solutions.</p>
<p>Ali Llewellyn, from Open <span class="caps">NASA</span>, will also be on site to support the
effort. <span class="caps">NASA</span> is very excited about their participation in the first ever
RHoK Jr event. <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s educational focus is on strengthening the <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s
future workforce, attracting and retaining students in <span class="caps">STEM</span> disciplines
and engaging Americans in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s mission. “The best education happens
when students use their growing technical skills to help address real
problems and RHoK Jr gives us an opportunity to help further these
objectives in the context of a collaborative experience. One of these
students could be the first human to walk on Mars – we want to help
inspire them as learners, problem solvers and&nbsp;explorers.”</p>
<p>The following organizations have requested technical assistance and will
be presenting their requests at the May event: Newtown Trails
Commission, Newtown Kindness, Ben’s Bells, The Animal Center (of
Newtown), Autism Speaks and the American Diabetes Association (<span class="caps">CT</span>&nbsp;Chapter).</p>
<p><strong>The vision is simple: anyone, anywhere should have the tools to change
the world at their fingertips. Acts of kindness come in all shapes and
sizes, and technology is just another avenue which needs to be&nbsp;explored.</strong></p>
