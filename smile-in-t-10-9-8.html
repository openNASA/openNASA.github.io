						<p><em>Last week, we announced the <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/05/22/global-award-winners-for-the-2013-international-space-apps-challenge/">Best in Class for the 2013 International
Space Apps Challenge</a>. The stories of these solutions and the teams
who created them are too good not to share. Thus, we bring you a series
of Best in Class&nbsp;profiles.</em></p>
<p><em>These are the voyages of the Space Apps&nbsp;Challenge…</em></p>
<p>It all began with a&nbsp;burrito.</p>
<p>Before Kate Gray remembered that there was such a thing as the
International Space Apps Challenge, or realized that it had set
challenges, she was looking up at the London&nbsp;sky.</p>
<p>A self-professed “proper space geek,” Gray contemplated the perpetual
Londonian cloud cover that rarely allowed photographs from space of the
historic city. Ideas that utilized today’s gadget-heavy culture to help
coordinate missions were already percolating throughout space culture.
Recalling a conversation with Tim Peake, renowned British astronaut, in
which they discussed the practicality and efficiency of iPads and apps
to astronauts, Gray was struck by inspiration. Her idea: an interfacing
system between astronauts in the International Space Station and
ordinary people on&nbsp;Earth.</p>
<p>What if there was an app that established direct communication between
astronauts and civilians that allowed them to track and schedule
viewings of the <span class="caps">ISS</span> from Earth? What if this same app also checked local
weather conditions beforehand, thereby saving precious time usually
wasted on waiting for the clouds to clear for good&nbsp;photography?</p>
<p>It is almost everyone’s childhood dream to be able to wave to an
astronaut in space, and Gray was no exception. With the brainchild that
would become T-10, and win the Best in Class category of Most Inspiring,
she set out to find a team tech-savvy enough to make it&nbsp;reality.</p>
<p>A mutual calling to see the aurora in Finland brought together Gray and
Joao Neves, one primarily on the computer-tech side of things who
expressed interest in becoming more involved with space-centered
projects. The two grabbed lunch and discussed future possibilities of
working together. Recalling Space Apps, Gray proposed an idea: if Neves
could make her project a reality, she would arrange his lodging in
London. – “Remember this moment,” Gray jokingly told her new associate
over that fateful burrito. “This is where it all&nbsp;starts.”</p>
<p>They had the idea for the app provided by Gray, and the data synthesis
skillset from Neves, but they still needed team members skilled in the
ways of app coding and design. By initiating a powerful Twitter
campaign, the two found their app coder, a mutual tech and radio friend
by the name of Ketan Majmudar. He provided the development front
necessary to get T-10 functional. All they needed now was a good&nbsp;design.</p>
<p>The London event was underway, and the T-10 team – at this point, only
Gray, Neves, and Majmudar – was galvanized by excitement. Rushing
around, Gray overheard the arrival of Dario Lofish, a designer of whom
she knew. Gray wasted no time – “Join our team!” she blurted, before
excitedly describing the concept behind T-10. After some deliberation,
Lofish returned, ready to take part. His skills for design and marketing
were exactly what the team needed, giving the project an exterior sheen
that reflected the hardcore programming of the app&nbsp;itself.</p>
<p>In a matter of 48 hours, the team transformed from a collection of near
strangers to a tightly knit group of friends, all bouncing off of
spectacular creative chemistry and a semi-dangerous Red Bull:blood
ratio, to produce an app that every astronaut they talked to (2)
expressed serious interest in&nbsp;using.</p>
<p>Although T-10 may have won the London challenge and one of the six Best
in Class titles, the project’s initiative doesn’t end there, as
evidenced by their continued effort to gain endorsement from astronauts
to take T-10&nbsp;live.</p>
<p>Their first goal, an undoubted success, was to emerge from the cloud of
creativity and innovation that is the International Space Apps&nbsp;Challenge.</p>
<p>Their next one:&nbsp;space.</p>
