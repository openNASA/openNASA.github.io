						<p>Over the past few years, we have been working hard at <span class="caps">NASA</span> to modernize
the way we approach software development. Open Source is a critical
component to our strategy. In 2011, we started a conversation around
open source in government and hosted a summit at <span class="caps">NASA</span> Ames Research
Center to bring together leaders, policymakers, and developers into the
same room to discuss how best improve the development and release of
open source at <span class="caps">NASA</span>. The event resulted in 13 recommendations, which
really shaped our strategy going&nbsp;forward.</p>
<p>The first summit was so helpful to the Agency that we wanted to hold
another, but this time with a broader focus. In 2012, the summit moved
to the Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span> area and the aim was to advance the use of open
source software throughout a wider government audience. The Department
of Veteran’s Affairs and the State Department joined the discussion. The
highly interactive summit highlighted a number of real-world examples,
and help everyone involved make forward progress towards the goal of
helping to improve innovation in government while driving costs&nbsp;down.</p>
<p>This year, we are holding the third Open Source Summit on June 25th and
26th at <span class="caps">NYU</span> in Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>. Like the two before, this event will
again bring together an exponentially growing community of open source
developers and leaders from over 11 federal agencies as well as private
industry. We will expand the conversation and focus on the following 3&nbsp;themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Source Communities: How they work. How to engage with them. How
    to manage&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Converting Closed Communities to Open: If you have a pre-existing
    development community and you are open sourcing the project, how do
    you manage this&nbsp;complexity?</li>
<li>Creating a New Community: So you&#8217;re releasing a project or data into
    the wild. How do you find people who care and get them excited about&nbsp;it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Eleven federal agencies have helped plan this summit to help ensure that
the speakers and topics address the real needs of agencies and answer
current questions that government agencies are asking. Tight budgets, a
continual need to innovate, and the rise of open source make this a very
relevant conference for anyone who is involved with <span class="caps">IT</span> in government or
community engagement. Here’s a sampling of questions that you can expect
will be&nbsp;addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can open source allow me to reduce <span class="caps">IT</span>&nbsp;costs?</li>
<li>How can open source allow me to create amazing&nbsp;solutions?</li>
<li>Why are people working in open source&nbsp;communities?</li>
<li>What’s happening with open source in my mission area (e,g.,health,
    defense,&nbsp;labor)?</li>
<li>Is closed source no longer the easiest&nbsp;path?</li>
<li>I have a project that I want to covert to open source. Now&nbsp;what!?</li>
<li>My agency’s contracts teams are confused about the legal and
    contractual issues involved with procuring and using open source.
    How can I help educate&nbsp;them?</li>
<li>How can I shift from a government-led model to a community-led&nbsp;model?</li>
<li>What’s happening at the intersection of open source and open&nbsp;data?</li>
<li>What’s happening with GitHub in&nbsp;government?</li>
<li>What’s happening with Drupal in&nbsp;government?</li>
<li>What are other agencies doing that I need to be aware of - or plug&nbsp;into?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can expect a very engaging event, presentations from industry
leaders, and<br />
face-to-face access to open source practitioners who are in the
trenches solving real-world problems now. If you are interested in the
role open source plays in government, as well as how you can build and
engage an open source community, we encourage you to attend and join us
on June&nbsp;25-26th.</p>
