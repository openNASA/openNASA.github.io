						<p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/Philtill777">Dr. Phil Metzger</a> is a physicist/planetary scientist at <span class="caps">NASA</span> Kennedy
Space Center who works on technologies for mining the Moon, Mars, and
asteroids; for developing extraterrestrial spaceports; and for robotic
industry in space. Outside his day job he <a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/">blogs</a> on his vision for
extending human civilization into the solar system (and graciously
allowed us to <a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/space-hackers-colonize-solar-system/">cross post his blog</a>.). At this weekend&#8217;s
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>, he created a challenge called
<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry/">Moonville</a> and joined the event at the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/kennedy-space-center/">Kennedy Space Center</a>. </em></p>
<p>I am sitting in a room at at the Kennedy Space Center for the
International Space Apps Challenge.  It is late at night, I’m very
tired, and there are eight other people in the room:  all much younger
than me, all college students, all writing software for a game called
“<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry/" title="Bootstrapping of Space Industry | International Space Apps Challenge">Moonville</a>“.  It will be a strategy game where the players simulate
the beginnings of industry in the solar system.  I submitted the
Moonville topic to the Space Apps Challenge so that eventually people
will play the game and through the game develop a winning strategy that
we can use to actually start industry in space.  It’s an exercise of
double-nested crowdsourcing.  The Space Apps Challenge is crowdsourcing
the writing of the game, so the game can crowdsource the development of
the strategy for space industry.  I’m amazed how much these students
have gotten done already, just sitting here in a room by themselves with
their laptops, a wifi, and this older guy (me) answering a few
questions.  They started entirely from scratch before dinner.  They plan
to be done by lunchtime tomorrow.  I didn’t know this was even&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>[![Laptop computer and engineering journal on solar system&nbsp;colonization][]][]</p>
<p>Developing a Moonville game to help colonize the solar&nbsp;system</p>
<p>A few minutes ago they were taking a pizza break, and I told them that
the fate of humanity very well could depend on space hackers.  I asked,
what if the governments of the world don’t prioritize space highly
enough to get lunar industry started?  What if the commercial space
companies don’t find enough investors to fund more than their immediate
business plans and so are unable to truly colonize space?  Who then will
take humanity beyond this planet?  I’m thinking it will have to be the
private citizens of the world, space hackers like these young people. 
Individually, they may not have billions of dollars like the private
investors, or trillions of dollars like the governments of the world,
but collectively they have much, much&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>For example, there are seven billion of us here on planet Earth, so what
if just <em>four</em> billion of us paid one dollar a year for ten years into
this future in space?  That would amount to <em>forty billion dollars</em>. 
That should be enough to get the job done.  Just one dollar a year. 
Surely we can do&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>But we might not convince four billion people to participate.  Too many
people don’t understand that a higher level of civilization is really
possible.  It seems too much like science fiction and so they don’t want
to throw away their dollar.  So here is another idea.  How about if just
the space enthusiasts of the world do it?  We have something more
valuable than cash, after all.  We have our abilities and our time.  We
could start developing the relevant technologies in our garages.  Some
of us could build lunar soil-mining robots.  (There are already hundreds
of people building robots in their garages for competitions and for
fun.)  Other enthusiasts could develop soil-to-metal refineries in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace" title="Wikipedia article">Hackerspaces</a> that are popping up all over the world.  Others
could adapt 3D printers for use with lunar-derived feedstock.  Still
others could write software to teleoperate this equipment.  How about if
we agree to build these things for a few years and then bring it
together to a volcano or to a desert location for a full-up,
lunar-analog field test?  We could demonstrate the equipment functioning
like it would on the Moon, robots building robots from nothing but the
soil and some ice and the sunlight as inputs.  (We could add some carbon
dioxide and ammonia to the water ice to better simulate the chemistry of
lunar ice.)  It would certainly be a grand party, as well as a great
field test!  You could count me&nbsp;in!</p>
<p>So how about if we do this every other year for a decade or two,
improving our technologies until we have engineered an entire set of
hardware that can build a copy of itself?  It would be like the <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Global_Village_Construction_Set" title="Global Village Construction Set">Global
Village Construction Set</a>, but designed for the Moon.  It would be a
tangible demonstration that self-sufficient space industry is now
possible, that humanity can master the solar system and
possess <a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/the-space-resource-revolution/" title="The Space Resource Revolution">billions of times greater capacity to do things</a> than we can
here on planet Earth.  It would demonstrate the imminence of <a href="http://www.philipmetzger.com/blog/the-big-idea-behind-space-industry/" title="The Big Idea Behind Space Industry">human
civilization at a truly higher level</a> and the possibility to solve the
big global problems including pollution, poverty, and resource
depletion.  It would give hope and excitement to the next generation of
youth.  It would enable us to do great things on Earth, in our solar
system, and in the galaxy.  If we do this — in our spare time in our
garages — how could the politicians and the corporate financiers of the
world fail then to pay the last bit of cost in sending it to the&nbsp;Moon?</p>
<p>The eight space hackers busily writing software here where I sit are by
no means alone in the International Space Apps Challenge.  Over <em>eight
thousand </em>space enthusiasts are participating in this event tonight. 
Some are in other rooms of this building, working on more of the 52
challenges besides Moonville.  And participants are all over the world,
including the 83 official event locations in places like Tokyo, Manila,
Abu Dhabi, Managua, Nairobi, New York — cities in 44 countries on<em> all
seven continents</em>.  Eleven of the locations are completely “sold out”
with no room for more participants.  According to <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/04/19/worlds-largest-hackathon/" title="World's Largest Hackathon">the <span class="caps">NASA</span> website</a>,
those are in Adelaide, Bangalore, Bogota, Guatemala City, London,
Monterrey, Recife, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, Santa Marta, Santiago and
Toronto.  Space enthusiasm is not limited to the countries that are
already flying in space!  It is a global phenomenon.  The young people
that I am watching in this room are right now collaborating with others
in Ecuador.  Meanwhile, I’m answering Moonville questions from Lieden,
emailing participants in Rome, waiting for the 2:30 a.m. Google Hangout
with Jakarta, typing this blog post, and reflecting on how the fate of
humanity might depend on young space hackers like&nbsp;these.</p>
<p>And you know what?  I’m feeling pretty good about&nbsp;that.</p>
