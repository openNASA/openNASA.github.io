						<p>Join <span class="caps">NASA</span> at the <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">Interactive</a> portion of <a href="http://sxsw.com/">South by Southwest
(<span class="caps">SXSW</span>)</a> this year in Austin! There are a number of space-related
panels, sessions and exhibits this year, including a special James Webb
Space Telescope <span class="caps">NASA</span> exhibit (which you can visit even if you are not
attending <span class="caps">SXSW</span>!). The James Web Telescope exhibit will be open from
Friday March 8 through Sunday March 10th. We also want to extend an
invitation for you to join the entire space community at a Space Meetup
on on Sunday March 10th at 1:30pm at the Meet Up Pavilion in the Austin
Convention Center.  Since we have such a strong representation from <span class="caps">NASA</span>
and the space community at SXSWi, this year we wanted to create an
intentional forum for everyone to come together at least one time during
the event.  We have worked to plan all the other space sessions so as
not to conflict and hope you will consider joining us.  This is your
chance to meet others and mingle with some extremely innovative people
from the space community as well as exchange stories about your favorite
space mission with some of the people who were directly&nbsp;involved.</p>
<p>Included below is a complete list of all the space-related activities
planned for SXSWi. This list includes both <span class="caps">NASA</span>-led events as well as
non-<span class="caps">NASA</span> events - they all look amazing!  If I&#8217;m missing something on
this list, let me know and I&#8217;ll add it. We look forward to seeing you&nbsp;there!</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Friday, March 8, through
Sunday, March 10</span></strong><br />
Interact with <span class="caps">NASA</span> at the James Webb Space Telescope Exhibit and See
Hubble&#8217;s Successor<br />
12 p.m. to 11 p.m.<br />
Location: Lawn outside the Long Center — Stop by on your way to the
Gaming Expo!<br />

<p><em><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s successor to Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope, will be 100
times more powerful. The Webb Telescope will orbit far beyond Earth’s
Moon where the cold vastness of space will allow it to study the
universe’s first galaxies as well as celestial objects hidden by clouds
of cosmic dust. Stop by the lawn outside the Long Center (701 W.
Riverside Drive) March 8-10 to see Northrop Grumman’s
tennis-court-sized, four-story-high, full-scale model of the Webb
Telescope. Learn about the vision behind Webb and the challenges of its
construction in this immersive experience that showcases the science,
images and technologies changing our understanding of the universe. Free
to the public, this exhibit features Microsoft’s interactive World Wide
Telescope and activities with <span class="caps">NASA</span> that demonstrate how Webb will
inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers to push the
boundaries of science and technology. Delve in for an in-depth look at
the perplexing questions that this incredible telescope is designed to
answer, such as: How did the universe form? Is our solar system unique?
Are we alone in the&nbsp;cosmos?</em></p>
