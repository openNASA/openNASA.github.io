</header>					<div class="article_content">
						<p>Last month, we submitted our 6 month report on <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy"><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Digital
Strategy</a> to the Office of Management and Budget. The 6 month
milestones for our <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/06/20/the-roadmap-for-digital-government/">Digital Strategy</a> are the 2nd update we&#8217;ve made to
the plan, following our 3 month milestones that we launched in August.
There are a number of new things that we&#8217;re super excited to&nbsp;share:</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Digital Services Governance Framework</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html">http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html</a><br />
The Digital Strategy is cross-cutting and involves dozens of leads and
potentially hundreds of potential participants from across the agency.
As a result, as we work towards implementing many of the goals of the
strategy, its imperative that we also look at how we manage our overall
direction and focus to ensure that the right people are getting involved
and that we&#8217;re working efficiently&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>Our Governance Strategy, the majority of which was written by the
awesome Sarah Rigdon in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Web Services office, plans to help us
focus our efforts by establishing the&nbsp;following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Clearly Defined Scope of&nbsp;Authority</li>
<li>Core Principals to Guide&nbsp;Action</li>
<li>Established Roles and&nbsp;Responsibilities</li>
<li>A Target&nbsp;State</li>
</ul>
<p>You can read more of the governance strategy at
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html">http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/governance.html</a></p>
<p><strong>An Agency-wide Inventory of Mobile Devices and Contracts</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html#5-1">http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/section5.html</a><br />
We also developing an inventory of mobile devices and contracts at the
agency which we expect to deliver to <span class="caps">OMB</span> shortly. <span class="caps">NASA</span> employees use
thousands of mobile devices, from smartphones to mobile hotspots to
pagers (yes, pagers - they still have some use in specialized
situations!), to stay connected to their work around the globe. We&#8217;re in
the midst of a major transition to a new service provider under the
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2010/dec/HQ_C10-080_ACES.html"><span class="caps">ACES</span> contract</a>, which has given the agency a great opportunity to
look closer at the mobile services we offer to employees and make them
even&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Additionally, the <span class="caps">CIO</span> group at <span class="caps">NASA</span> has focused on our <span class="caps">BYOD</span> (Bring Your
Own Device) policy as a major way to empower employees to stay connected
to their work. As part of this, we&#8217;ve realized that mobile interfaces
and responsive design are more important than ever in ensuring the
services <span class="caps">NASA</span> offers both internally and to the public are accessible,
usable, and&nbsp;extensible.</p>
<p>As always, our Digital Strategy is available in a number of formats,
including <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy"><span class="caps">HTML</span></a>, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.json"><span class="caps">JSON</span></a>, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/digitalstrategy.xml"><span class="caps">XML</span></a>. It&#8217;s also
available to the public via <a href="http://www.github.com/nasa/digital-strategy">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;re excited as we are with the progress we&#8217;re making on
implementing a Digital Strategy for <span class="caps">NASA</span>. As always, if you have
comments, questions, or feedback for us, please leave us a comment -
we&#8217;d love to hear from&nbsp;you!</p>
