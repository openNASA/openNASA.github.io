</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>It has been four months since the <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a>
took place. &nbsp;We are currently in the process of planning a number of
future mass collaboration events and in reflecting back on what we
learned over the past six months, I wanted to share a few words from the
introduction to the <a class="reference external" href="http://goo.gl/QR3Em">final report</a> for the International Space Apps
Challenge. &nbsp;It really addresses why innovation is so important, why it's
so often&nbsp;bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable, and why it's
so&nbsp;different&nbsp;the normal way we do business.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What does it really mean to innovate?</strong></p>
<p>Innovation at NASA often reveals itself as a single advancement in a
specific technology. The challenge then lies in reliably repeating
the act of this advancement. We believe that innovative practices
are the key to creating and discovering state-of-the-art technology.
The International Space Apps Challenge sought to bridge the gap
between innovative technology, and its practice.</p>
<p>In business and government, there currently exists a set of
techniques for developing new products that has been carried over
from the industrial age: a large team is pulled together, the budget
is established, a business model or project plan is created, a
detailed product road map is developed and rolled out to a user base
in phases. This process has proven itself many times over and is
especially important when building an expensive rocket â€“ the tiniest
error could yield catastrophic failure. Much technological
advancement has been made through this process. However, these
time-tested methods of management do not lend well to seasons of
uncertainty. Innovation, on the other hand, thrives in those
seasons.</p>
<p>Innovation is bottom-up, decentralized and unpredictable. True
innovation necessitates failure. The more you experiment, the more
you fail, the more you learn. Small technologies and initial
development deserve innovative process and the opportunity for
failure.</p>
<p>At the International Space Apps Challenge we opened up challenges of
space exploration and social need and empowered citizens around the
world to solve those challenges. This was a bold risk. NASA
partnered with organizations with whom they had not previously
partnered. NASA empowered local planners in 24 cities around the
world, with the vision for contributing to space exploration and
social good. Passionate citizens were asked to find and share their
solutions to the challenges. In the process of planning, executing
and concluding the event we have learned a lot; and recognized the
power released when we work together with others committed to
changing the way the world works. With that in mind, this report is
to share our experience. We experimented with a model for
accelerating technology and have captured that story here to be
built upon. We hope that business and government alike can carry the
story forward.</p>
