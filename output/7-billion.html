</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>There was an [op-ed piece published in The NY Times on 23 October 2011
written by Joel E. Cohen][], a mathematical biologist who heads the
Laboratory of Populations at Rockefeller University and Columbia
University, titled, “Seven Billion.”  Sandy Leeds, a finance professor
at the University of Texas, summarized some key facts, <a href="http://leedsonfinance.com/2011/11/01/seven-billion/">in his blog post
on November 6th</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The UN estimates that our world population reached seven billion
    at the end of October.</li>
<li>Our world population has doubled in the past 50 years. We had
    three billion in 1959, four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987
    and six billion in 1998.</li>
<li>The UN anticipates 8 billion people by 2025, 9 billion by 2043 and
    10 billion by 2083. India will have more people than China shortly
    after 2020. Before 2040, sub-Saharan Africa will have more people
    than India.</li>
<li>In 1950, there were nearly three times as many Europeans as
    sub-Saharan Africans. By 2010, there were 16% more sub-Saharan
    Africans than Europeans. By 2100, there will be nearly five
    sub-Saharan Africans for every European.</li>
<li>Life expectancy is now 70. The average number of children per
    woman fell worldwide to 2.5. It was five in 1950. The world’s
    population is growing at 1.1% per year, half the peak rate in the
    1960s.</li>
<li>In 1950, for each person 65 and older, there were more than six
    children under 15. By 2070, elderly people will outnumber children
    under 15 and there will be only three people of working age (15 to
    64) for every two people under 15 or 65 and older. We will have
    intense pressure to extend the working age beyond 65.</li>
<li>Nearly half the world lives on \$2 per day or less. In China, the
    figure is 36%; in India it’s 76%.</li>
<li>Approximately 850 million to 925 million people experience food
    insecurity or chronic undernourishment. In much of Africa and
    South Asia, more than half the children are stunted (low height
    for their age) as a result of chronic hunger.</li>
<li>The world produced 2.3 billion metric tons of cereal grains in
    2009-10. This is enough calories to sustain nine to eleven billion
    people. BUT…only 46% of the grain went into human mouths. Domestic
    animals got 34% of the crop and 19% went to industrial uses like
    biofuels, starches and plastics.</li>
<li>Human demands on the earth have grown enormously. (Unfortunately,
    the atmosphere, the oceans and the continents have stayed the same
    size.) Already, more than a billion people live without an
    adequate, renewable supply of fresh water.</li>
<li>About two-thirds of fresh water is used for agriculture.</li>
<li>We’re going to see huge shifts in the geopolitical balance of
    numbers, further declines in the number of children per woman,
    smaller but more numerous households, an increasingly elderly
    population, and growing and more numerous cities.</li>
<li>Growth in households can be even more important than pure
    population growth. Each household has energy demands.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The stats are thought-provoking and really help provide the context for
the future of our world. But, sometimes reading the numbers isn’t
enough. That’s why I wanted to share this great youtube video
infographic created by <a href="http://www.npr.org/">NPR</a> that helps visualize the numbers in a
really creative way.</p>

<p><em>It was just over two centuries ago that the global population was 1
billion — in 1804. But better medicine and improved agriculture resulted
in higher life expectancy for children, dramatically increasing the
world population, especially in the West.</em></p>
<p><em>As higher standards of living and better health care are reaching more
parts of the world, the rates of fertility — and population growth —
have started to slow down, though the population will continue to grow
for the foreseeable future.</em></p>
<p><em>U.N. forecasts suggest the world population could hit a peak of 10.1
billion by 2100 before beginning to decline. But exact numbers are hard
to come by — just small variations in fertility rates could mean a
population of 15 billion by the end of the century.</em></p>
