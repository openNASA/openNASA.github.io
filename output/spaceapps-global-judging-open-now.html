Challenge][]! The Space Apps Challenge fosters innovation by providing a
platform for citizens from around the world to work together to solve
current challenges relevant to both space exploration and social
need. The <a href="http://innovationendeavors.com/">Innovation Endeavors</a> and <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creative">Talenthouse</a> community of
investors, entrepreneurs and advisors are here to support and celebrate
these teams and their innovations to the fifty challenges - and invite
you to vote for your favorite App. The final winners will be determined
with your votes and along with an internationally recognized jury of
investors and entrepreneurs from Innovation Endeavors.</p>
<p>The videos submitted on behalf of each nominated project also
demonstrate the vision of the collaboration process, the passion of the
participants, and what it means to them to engage the data in their
context. These videos tell the story about what is possible when people
get a vision about exploration and for changing the world with science.
<em>What earth observation data could help people, organizations, and
governments make better decisions? How can we convey the orbital
perspective to people on Earth? What are other low-cost off-the-shelf
hardware options for exploration? What are new ways we could visualize
data? How else could we communicate ideas too big for words or organize
data bigger than we have yet been able to manage? What new things can we
learn when we mashup data sources? How can we share data more
efficiently?</em> Space Apps asked all these questions in the global
community - and discovered some interesting ideas and answers along the
way.</p>

visualizes near-real time aurora data. During the Science Hack Day
Dublin in March, we built up an Aurora Lamp. This consisted on an
artistic representation of an Aurora using LEDs. However, this was not
connected with any data feed. For the Space Apps Challenge we tried to
improve this original project by using real data. On one side we
developed a program that automatically downloads and processes data from
NOAA's POES satellites. This gives an indication of aurora activity.
However, as the satellites measure just what is below them the data
needs to be extrapolated to show all the hemisphere. Simultaneously, we
also developed software to generate a layer for Google Earth showing the
forecast of aurora activity. This is based on magnetic field
measurements from NASA's ACE spacecraft. <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/show/submission/detail/PW69PM">Vote here.</a></p>

<p>[Code/Game Controller/Water Sampling Mechanism OpenROV Framework
Development Challenge][] (<a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/location/techshop">San Francisco, USA</a>) OpenROV is a DIY
telerobotics community centered around underwater exploration and
education. The community has developed a low-cost telerobotic submarine
that can be built with mostly off-the-shelf parts and is increasingly
capable of doing serious scientific research. The goal of the project is
to democratize exploration by allowing anyone to explore and study
underwater environments. The OpenROV community is also laying the
foundation for globally-connected citizen scientists to share their data
and findings. <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/show/submission/detail/WP23KX">Vote here.</a></p>

vegetable and other crops through the use of location, climate and
growing data. The Grower's Nation application is designed to reduce the
barriers to growing by taking location, climate and growing conditions
data into consideration and aims to give more people the information
they need when selecting what to grow.  The crop dataset we are creating
is possibly the first of its kind that is available open source, and
will enable cross referencing of crop, climate, weather and soil data.
When complete, it will include the growing conditions required for
different varieties of fruit, vegetables and grains. During the
challenge weekend, we had some great collaborations with teams from
around the world including: Exeter, San Francisco, Chile, the Dominican
Republic, Nairobi and New York. We hope to continue collaborating with
related projects into the future. There is a lot of potential for follow
on work from this project and the Growers Nation team members are

Impact challenge does just that! By aggregating yours and others usage
data, calculating carbon usage based on the distance and mode of
transport you take, this app will provide you with a list optimised
routes detailing time, cost and carbon usage to give you ultimate
control on your journey! If even just a small percentage of smartphone
users are influenced to change their commuting habits to more
environmentally friendly modes of transport, the potential that the
MyTravel App has in the battle to reduce carbon emissions is enormous.

time illumination can be used as a measure of development, especially in
rural areas. We built a tool which compares different geospatial data
sources, allowing differential measurements to be made over time. In
this case it was used to compare night time illumination with population
density changes over the last 20 years. <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/show/submission/detail/RF4FT2">Vote here.</a></p>

developing world lack proper access to food pricing information. Without
proper information, rural farmers are vulnerable to a variety of
problems.CERES solves these problems by allowing farmers to exchange
commodity price information with their peers, allowing them to make
better-informed decisions. Farmers interact with the service by using
SMS to check current prices within seconds. For large purchasers and
governments, CERES provides a powerful web interface for decision makers
to view the data in aggregate. Over the coming months, our launch
partner, Opportunity International - Nicaragua, will be piloting our
application in rural Nicaragua. Won't you join us in driving economic
transformation? <a href="http://www.talenthouse.com/creativeinvites/preview/ac19c0ec35da61e8c028dbf1d4ec99c3/571">Vote here.</a></p>
