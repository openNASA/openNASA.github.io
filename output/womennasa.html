</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Women@NASA is a collection of 32 videos and essays from women across the
agency who contribute to NASA’s mission in a variety of way. With the
aim of illuminating the vibrant community of dedicated women workers who
play a vital role at the agency, the site features stories of women
overcoming almost every obstacle imaginable to pursue their dreams and
make a difference in the world. In the future, we hope that the website
will support a collaborative and supportive community of women at NASA,
and serve as the hub of all activity related to women’s issues at the
agency. In addition, we hope that these stories will inspire girls
everywhere to reach for the stars, and explore the myriad of
opportunities available to them through pursuing careers in science,
technology, engineering and mathematics.</p>
<p>The Women@NASA website was created in response to the Executive Order,
signed March 11, 2009, establishing the White House Council on Women and
Girls. Chaired by the heads of every agency and major White House office
across the federal government, the Council aims to provide a coordinated
federal response to issues that have a distinct impact on women and
girls. Working across all executive departments and agencies, the
Council reviews and recommends changes to policies that have a distinct
impact on women in the workforce and assists in the development of
legislative and policy proposals of special importance to women and
girls.</p>
<p>The Women@NASA website was created by the NASA Open Government team in
order to encourage transparency, participation, and collaboration and
create a new level of openness and accountability at NASA. The
Women@NASA project is the perfect opportunity to celebrate women from
across the agency who contribute to NASA’s mission in many ways.</p>
