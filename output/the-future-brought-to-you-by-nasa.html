</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Delivering information that is easily understood builds trust and
confidence between government and citizens. One of the objectives of the
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html#framework">Open Government Initiative at NASA</a> is to help improve the
accessibility to and understanding of the information and data the
Agency releases. One approach to this is to better visualize complicated
datasets, with a particular focus on user engagement. We simply want to
help share the compelling story behind the data we release.</p>
<p>In our role at the agency, we are fortunate to have access to very
interesting data sets. In November 2011, the Open Government team worked
with members of the <a href="http://www.globalspaceexploration.org/">International Space Exploration Coordination Group
(ISECG)</a> to produce an infographic for their <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/03/the-global-exploration-roadmap-interactive-edition/">Global Exploration
Roadmap</a>. Since then we have been working with NASA's Office of Chief
Technologist to visualize their recently released <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html">Space Technology
Roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/roadmaps/index.html">Space Technology Roadmap</a> graphically presents the wide range of
technological investments needed to advance the nation's space
capabilities. The roadmaps outline in detail the 14 draft Space
Technology Area's that were reviewed by the <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13354">National Research Council
(NRC)</a> and released in a <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=13354">final report</a> on 1 February 2012. The roadmaps define the key new technologies
required for our human and robotic explorers to safely venture into deep
space, to better understand how our own solar system evolved and to
unravel the mysteries of our universe.</p>

<p>The first phase of this project is a graphic that represents the various
technologies NASA needs to develop. The graphic is meant as a starting
point for anyone interested in the what the future of space exploration
might look like. We plan to create a more interactive version of this
infographic that digs deeper into each of the technology areas.</p>
<p>The visualization is the handy work of the talented <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/drbonill/">Dennis Bonilla</a>,
Tate Srey, Erin Bonilla, and Matt Scott, who have an unmatched ability
to elegantly display complex data. We've worked with them on previously
well received graphics and interactive systems.</p>
