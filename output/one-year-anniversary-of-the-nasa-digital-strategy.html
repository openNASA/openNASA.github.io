</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Do you follow any astronauts on Twitter mainly for their photos of Earth
from space? Did you know they’re taking those pictures from a space
station that travels 5 miles per second? Now there’s an app that
calculates photo ops and conditions for photographs, making it much
easier for them to capture those photos we all love.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked up and wondered where that space station is? Now,
you can use one of many apps to tell you exactly when the space station
orbits overhead, and you don’t even need a telescope.</p>
<p>Or have you wondered where on Mars the Curiosity Rover is right now, and
how cold it must be? Now, you can find that out from your phone. Sol,
the world’s first interplanetary weather app, is now available for
download.</p>
<p><em>Where did all these amazing apps and APIs come from?</em></p>
<p>Over the past year since the launch of the Digital Government Strategy,
NASA has made its data and services more and more accessible to the
world. Through technology development events such as the International
Space Apps Challenge and the National Day of Civic Hacking, developers,
researchers, entrepreneurs, and citizens like you have shaped that data
into apps and APIs that more closely connect us to our planet and our
universe.</p>
<p>At NASA, most of our questions are rooted in one commitment: to explore,
and to connect everyone on Earth to that exploration. How do we make
space data more alive and tangible to everyone?</p>
<p>NASA is extremely committed to implementing directives such as the
Digital Government Strategy, the Open Government Initiative, and the new
Open Data Executive Order. Together, these three directives are
important steps forward for government agencies like NASA. They
encourage agencies to open up their valuable data to the public and give
external developers tools to build new technology and services. They
enable us to keep pace with the rapid deployment of mobile technology
and rising citizen expectations, and ensure our technology is available
to citizens anytime, anywhere, and on any device. Most importantly, at
the core of these initiatives is a new approach to how government works
and delivers its services to the American people.</p>
<p>In support of the anniversary, NASA has updated the status of all the
milestones for the Digital Strategy, released a number of new mobile
applications, made more data available through APIs, and created a page
for developers looking for more information. We encourage you to check
out the following related links. We’ve also included some notable
Digital Strategy highlights below.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Notable Digital Strategy Highlights</h3>
<h4 dir="ltr"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">data.nasa.gov &amp; code.nasa.gov</span></h4>
<p>NASA engages with the public through a variety of avenues, but perhaps
the most relevant to the Digital Strategy initiative is our commitment
to open data and open source software. Two platforms, data.nasa.gov and
code.nasa.gov, serve as the home for the Agency's efforts in these
areas. Code.nasa.gov expands NASA’s open source activities, surfaces
existing activities, and guides internal and external groups in open
development, release, and contribution. In doing so, NASA hopes to lower
barriers to building open technology in partnership with the public.
Data.nasa.gov is NASA’s flagship platform for sharing information about
the vast stores of data we collect and store, with over 100 years of
U.S. aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists, and many others can contribute
directly to the exploration of space and Earth by bringing new
perspectives to the data. The Agency continues to work to improve data
accessibility and is actively incentivizing the use of government data
by citizens. To address the ever-increasing amount of tools and data
catalogs that are publicly available on NASA’s many websites, this
directory lists publicly available datasets and serves to streamline the
process for posting them on data.gov. The directory includes information
and direct links to more than 1,000 datasets.</p>

</ul>
<h4><span style="text-decoration: underline;">APIs</span></h4>
<p>NASA sees huge promise in web APIs, as they can enhance our ability to
deliver data to both established and new audiences. Although the Agency
offers petabytes of publicly available data to the world from a variety
of missions, only a small portion is accessible through API interfaces.
The Digital Strategy mandate directed NASA to use web APIs to make
available high-value data and content for at least two existing major
customer-facing systems. Examples of NASA-produced APIs include:</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 dir="ltr">NASA Data API</h5>
<p>The data.nasa.gov API allows a machine-readable interface to return
metadata from the site organized by category, tag, date, or search
term. We’re hoping this allows new and creative visualizations of the
data resources NASA provides to the public. Additionally, it is a
learning experience for us as we work to expand transparency,
participation, and collaboration at NASA through new uses of
technology.</p>
<p><a href="http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/">http://data.nasa.gov/api-info/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearinghouse (ECHO)</h5>
<p>The NASA-developed Earth Observing System (EOS) Clearinghouse (ECHO)
is a spatial and temporal metadata registry and order broker built by
NASA's Earth Science Data and Information System (ESDIS) that enables
the science community to more easily use and exchange NASA's data and
services. ECHO's main objective is to enable broader use of NASA's EOS
data. It allows users to more efficiently search and access data and
services, and increases the potential for interoperability with new
tools and services. The value of these resources increases with the
potential to exchange and interoperate. ECHO has been working with
other organizations to provide their Earth science metadata alongside
NASA's for users to search and access. ECHO stores metadata from a
variety of science disciplines and domains, including Climate
Variability and Change, Carbon Cycle and Ecosystems, Earth Surface and
Interior, Atmospheric Composition, Weather, and Water and Energy
Cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/">http://api.echo.nasa.gov/echo/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Heliocentric Trajectories Web Services</h5>
<p>An API offering heliocentric trajectories for selected spacecraft,
planets, and comets.</p>
<p><a href="http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/">http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/helio/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Satellite Situation Center API</h5>
<p>The Satellite Situation Center (SSC) web services allow a software
developer to use portions of the SSC software in their own
applications. SSC is a system to cast geocentric spacecraft location
information into a framework of (empirical) geophysical regions and
mappings of spacecraft locations along lines of the Earth's magnetic
field. This capability is one key to mission science planning (both
single missions and coordinated observations of multiple spacecraft
with ground-based investigations) and to subsequent multi-mission data
analysis.</p>
<p><a href="http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/">http://sscweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/WebServices/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Coordinated Data Analysis System (CDAS) Web Services</h5>
<p>The Coordinated Data Analysis System (CDAS) web services allow a
software developer to use CDAS services in their own applications.
CDAS supports simultaneous multi-mission, multi-instrument selection
and comparison of science data among a wide range of current space
missions. While CDAWeb provides access to this data through an
HTML-based user interface, these web services provides a (web)
application programming interface (API) to CDAS. If you are developing
an application that requires science data from any CDAS-held datasets,
then the CDAS web services will provide an interface to the data for
your application.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>With constrained budgetary resources and the large, complex, and legacy
systems our data is housed in, however, relying solely on NASA data
owners to release APIs is not the best approach to opening our data to
the world. Thus, our strategy has been to launch a series of challenges
and collaboration opportunities to enable citizen developers around the
world to help us in our quest to further the transparency and
accessibility of NASA data systems. Events like the International Space
Apps Challenge create opportunities for thousands of citizen developers
from across the planet to contribute their time, and help the agency
create front-end APIs for many of our legacy data systems.</p>
<p>NASA has hosted two International Space Apps Challenge events, the first
in April 2012 and the second in April 2013. In the 2013 event, over
9,100 participants at over 83 cities around the world created 770
unique, open source solutions for a series of challenges the agency
issued. The challenges varied in scope and subject, from creating data
visualizations to designing more efficient air traffic control systems
to creating new API interfaces for legacy datasets. With relatively
little investment from the Agency, dozens of unique APIs were born out
of the initiative, many of which are listed below. Going forward, NASA
hopes to hold more events like the International Space Apps Challenge in
collaboration with our own internal efforts. In adopting these APIs, we
can harness the power of citizen collaboration to assist us in reaching
our goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 dir="ltr">ExoAPI</h5>
<p>The ExoAPI is a powerful tool that provides access to exoplanet data
through a simple RESTful API. Developed as part of Space Apps
Challenge 2012.</p>
<p><a href="http://exoapi.com/">http://exoapi.com/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">SkyMorph/NEAT API</h5>
<p>This API wraps NASA's SkyMorph archive in a RESTful JSON interface.
Currently, it provides observation and image data from the NEAT
survey. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asterank.com/skymorph">http://www.asterank.com/skymorph</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.asterank.com/api">http://www.asterank.com/api</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">{MAAS} API</h5>
<p>The {MAAS} API is an open source REST API built to make it easier and
more efficient to build interactive applications that want to utilize
the wealth of weather data being transmitted by the Curiosity Rover on
Mars. Our API is built upon the REMS (Rover Environmental Monitoring
Station) data provided by the Centro de Astrobiologia (CSIC-INTA).
Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge 2013.</p>

Laboratory. It is an online solar system data and ephemeris
computation service that provides access to key solar system data and
flexible production of highly accurate ephemerides for solar system
objects. Through NASA JPL's HORIZONS system, we have opened up their
online solar system data and ephemeris computation service to the web,
via a RESTful JSON API. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge
2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://nasa.api.niewma.com/">http://nasa.api.niewma.com/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">The Blue Marble API</h5>
<p>The Blue Marble API provides programmatic access to NASA images of the
Earth by location. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://bigmarbleapi.azurewebsites.net/Help">http://bigmarbleapi.azurewebsites.net/Help</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">Predict the Sky API</h5>
<p>We combine global weather data with a comprehensive library of space
events, from the International Space Station passing overhead to
planets visible to the naked eye. Simple API calls let you find out
when the next interesting space events will be visible, from any
location worldwide. Developed as part of Space Apps Challenge 2013.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Optimized Mobile Services</h4>
<p>As mobile devices continue to count for a larger percentage of overall
web traffic in the US, NASA has strived to offer a variety of services
in mobile friendly offerings, including via specialized mobile
applications, mobile optimized websites, and SMS gateways. The Digital
Strategy mandate directed NASA to optimize at least two existing
priority customer-facing services for mobile use and publish a plan for
improving additional existing services. As with the APIs, however,
constrained budgetary resources have contributed to an environment in
which relying solely on NASA programs to release mobile interfaces is
not the best approach to furthering this objective. Increasing
accessibility for our services and optimizing them for mobile users is
ongoing work that will continue far into the future. Here are six
examples of recently optimized services developed by NASA.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5 dir="ltr">NASA Mobile</h5>
<p>The NASA app is the public’s window to the universe. The free app,
which aggregates a variety of NASA web content, services and
individual apps, and also includes a mobile-optimized website, is
available for iPhone and Android devices. It offers live streaming
NASA Television coverage of agency missions and events, showcases more
than 11,000 images of Earth, the solar system and beyond and even lets
users track the International Space Station and learn when the
orbiting laboratory will fly over their home.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/</a></p>
<h5 dir="ltr">WebTADS Mobile</h5>
<p>WebTADS Mobile is a lighter version of the desktop-based WebTADS
developed to provide NASA civil servants with the convenience of
recording time when they're not in the office or connected via VPN.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.nasa.gov/content/webtads">https://apps.nasa.gov/content/webtads</a></p>
