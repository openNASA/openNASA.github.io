<p>One by one I begin configuring the communication tools that have proven
invaluable when recruiting and retaining volunteers for the <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/pineapple-project/">Pineapple
Project</a>, a personal interest originally developed for the April 2012
<a class="reference external" href="spaceappschallenge.org:">International Space Apps Challenge</a>.&nbsp; Just five months later the
challenge is being prepped to be rerun for its 3<sup>rd</sup> hackathon
along with sister project <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/growers-nation/">Grower’s Nation</a>, conceived 5000 miles away
in London.</p>
<p><strong>Why Continue Hacking?</strong></p>
<p>Because there is life after the Space Apps Challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp; A highly
complex, evolving life with dynamic needs demanding technologies,
skillsets and solutions much bigger than one person and one codeathon.
Which is exciting.&nbsp; And admittedly, at times incredibly frustrating, as
we struggle to navigate data dead ends, the challenges (pun intended) of
hacking across time zones and the naivety associated with attempting to
solve a problem related to a pressing social issue in 48 hours. But we
do it, again and again, and yet again.</p>
<p>Because the need for mass collaboration and big data to mitigate global
food security concerns is real. And because we were inspired by <a class="reference external" href="rhok.org">Random
Hacks of Kindness</a> (RHoK) and the Space Apps Challenge where we watched
in amazement as Francisco &amp; Hanna from Chile bought a domain and
designed an outstanding user interface, supplemented by an Android App
that “Los Tainos” of Santo Domingo poured their soul into as Dan,
Venkat, and others from San Francisco managed solutions to be paired
with an SMS capability all while a group of talented individuals from
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">MetOffice UK</a> supported a common database and developed the
Galactic Award winning Grower’s Nation solution.&nbsp; It is the community
that keeps us developing, and the possibility of getting one step closer
to having a working prototype to address a rather impossible challenge
in a single weekend.</p>
<p>However, robust solutions to complex issues like food security require
expert insights and access to well-organized, accurate datasets.
Unfortunately finding these repositories has been the biggest obstacle
we have encountered when designing apps contingent on large information
banks such as those linking crop and climate variables.&nbsp;&nbsp; For this
reason, we are eager to participate this weekend in <a class="reference external" href="http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/Hacking4Hunger">Hacking for
Hunger.</a></p>
<p><strong>Hacking for Hunger</strong></p>
<p>As part of the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opendatainitiative.org/">Open Data Initiative</a> and the U.S. Government's broader
commitment to food security, transparency, and innovation, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.usaid.gov/">USAID</a> has
launched the <a class="reference external" href="idea.usaid.gov:tags:food-security-open-data-challenge">Food Security Open Data Challenge</a> to convene food
security stakeholders, data technologists, and other development
enthusiasts to build innovative solutions for food security. The
Challenge builds on a number of Administration priorities with a goal to
develop new applications that use and build robust data relevant to food
security, to demonstrate within and outside of government the potential
of open data and social innovators in development, and to ensure that
government serves as a platform for fomenting entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>The hackathon component of the challenge, Hacking for Hunger, will be
kicked off Sept 14<sup>th</sup> by USAID Administrator Raj Shah and will
provide a platform for participants to collaborate virtually to create
new or to join existing teams to finalize solutions for an expert panel
of judges.&nbsp; The best projects (and presenters) will join USAID in Des
Moines to speak at the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/events/iowa_hunger_summit/">Iowa Hunger Summit</a> on World Hunger Day,
October 16th 2012 and will be invited to participate in the week-long
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.worldfoodprize.org/">World Food Prize</a> and Bourlag Dialogue events.&nbsp; So far, six projects
have been proposed for the challenge. You can learn more about the
challenges, or start your own at
<a class="reference external" href="http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/challengequestion">http://idea.usaid.gov/opendata/challengequestion</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Why Participate?</strong></p>
<p>Because as we learned from the International Space Challenge &amp; RHoK;
your code, your hacks and your solutions have the potential to
facilitate a community of users &amp; contributors that endure well beyond
one codeathon.&nbsp; And that’s pretty cool.</p>
