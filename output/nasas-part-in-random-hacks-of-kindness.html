</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a community of innovation that is
focused on developing practical open source solutions to disaster risk
management and climate change adaptation challenges. RHoK is a
collective initiative by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, NASA and the World
Bank, which brought together thousands of people June 4-5, 2011, from
over 18 locations around the globe to create open solutions to solve
some of humanity’s toughest challenges.</p>
<p>The US events took place in Hartford, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle and
Silicon Valley. International locations included Toronto, Canada,
Aarhus, Denmark, Basel, Switzerland, Berlin, Germany, Bangalore, India,
Buenos Aires, Argentina, Kampala, Uganda, Lusaka, Zambia, Melbourne,
Australia, Nairobi, Kenya, Trento, Italy, and Santiago, Chile.</p>
<p>Applications created in past RHoK events are already making an impact
across the globe. “I'm OK”, an SMS (Short Message Service) application
that lets people inform their families of their status during
emergenices, was actually used on the ground during the devastating
earthquakes in Haiti and Chile in 2010. The World Bank is piloting
CHASM, software for visualizing landslide risk, in the Caribbean. Other
apps have received support and interest from governments,
non-governmental organizations (NGO) and other international
organizations around the world.</p>
<p>RHoK #3 was the most successful RHoK event yet and is a great example
of what NASA is doing to help accelerate innovation, collaboration and
development of open technologies.  To learn more about the vision and
some of the results of this worldwide effort, please continue reading.</p>

<p><strong>What is Random Hacks of Kindness?</strong></p>
<p>RHoK works by bringing experts in development and volunteers with a
broad set of skills in software development and design together to
create solutions to some of humanity’s toughest challenges. The events
draw the best and the brightest hackers from around the world to sprint
on developing technology solutions. It has been described as “a globally
coordinated competitive hacking event where anyone interested in
technology (software developers, independent hackers, students, etc.)
comes together with experts in disaster risk management (NGOs,
organizations within the U.N., individuals involved in relief and
development work) to create software-based solutions that address
problems causing human suffering.”<br />
Random Hacks of Kindness was founded in 2009 in partnership
between<a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/google">Google</a>,<a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/microsoft">Microsoft</a>,<a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/yahoo">Yahoo!</a>,<a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/nasa">NASA</a> and the<a href="http://www.rhok.org/sponsor/world-bank">World
Bank</a>. Since then thousands of volunteers have worked on applications
that are already making an impact.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe the “hackathon” as a concept?</strong></p>
<p>Wikipedia has a great
definition:<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon</a>.  They call it “an
event when programmers meet to do collaborative computer programming”
and give some great background on the concept.</p>
<p><strong>What is “Open Government” and what does that have to do with RHoK?</strong></p>
<p>The Open Government Initiative is an innovative strategy for changing
how government works.   NASA’s founding legislation in 1958 instructed
NASA to "…provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information” and embedded the principles of open
government into the agency from its founding. The Initiative, which we
are implementing under White House direction via the President’s Open
Government Directive, is our commitment to revisit these values as we
create a new level of openness and accountability in our policies,
technology, and overall culture.</p>
<p>Last April, we released NASA’s Open Government Plan which sets up 150+
milestones for more than 22 key projects and 3 Flagship Initiatives.
NASA’s Flagship Initiatives include open source software development,
the establishment of the NASA Nebula cloud computing platform, and the
expansion of participatory exploration as a core engagement process
across the agency.  You can see the plan and track our progress
at:<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open">http://www.nasa.gov/open</a>.  We just released a really great
infographic that talks about many of the Open Government related
projects we are working on at NASA, which you can view here:
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/infographic.html">http://www.nasa.gov/open/infographic.html</a>.</p>
<p>The philosophies and practices of the Open Government Initiative reflect
the shifting global environment and the challenges that this poses to
government.  We have a mandate from our nation’s leadership to engage
the public in the core of our mission, giving us permission to do things
differently.  We see Open Government as a catalyst to improve the way we
communicate, the way we collaborate, and the way we do business.</p>
<p>RHoK is a project of the Open Government Initiative within the Office of
the Chief Information Officer. The Open Government team is part of the
core strategy team for RHoK and attends some of the physical mainstage
RHoK events and also participates in the online RHoK community
year-round.  Our hope is that we will serve as another resource to share
information about what NASA has to offer for developers who are creating
practical open source, open technology solutions.</p>
<p><strong>What does the “Open Government Team” do?</strong></p>
<p>The “Open Government Team” is responsible for the implementation of the
Open Government Initiative at NASA.  We work every day to establish a
solid foundation for institutional change at NASA based on five guidiing
principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external
    stakeholders</li>
<li>Enable citizen participation in the NASA mission</li>
<li>Improve internal NASA collaboration and innovation</li>
<li>Encourage partnerships capable of creating economic opportunity</li>
<li>Institutionalize OpenGov philosophies and practices at NASA</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why does NASA participate in RHoK?</strong></p>
<p>NASA is one of the founding partners of RHoK, along with Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo! and the World Bank.  It’s a unique collaboration that
encourages developers and experts to use their skills to help change the
world.  NASA participates by encouraging the utilization of NASA data –
specifically, the use of what we call “open data.” NASA has immensely
valuable open databases, which can serve as the content to many
potential world-changing apps.</p>
<p><strong>Why does NASA think RHoK a good resource for innovation?</strong></p>
<p>A main focus of the Open Government Initiative is to offer citizens and
communities of innovators opportunities to participate in NASA’s space
exploration mission and likewise, for NASA to work with citizens. RHoK
is extremely important for us because we strive to learn from the
know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of those outside government
institutions. We have a number of “innovation platforms” that we have
deployed to gives citizen explorers an opportunity to access our
scientific data and help solve our toughest challenges.  RHoK is one of
those many platforms for innovation.</p>
<p>Since Open Government is all about embracing the concept of “open
innovation” - the idea of bringing together thousands of software
developers from around the world to crowdsource some of humanities
toughest challenges is really appealing to us.  We value working in a
transparent, participatory, and collaborative fashion because it helps
us improve performance, inform decision-making, encourage
entrepreneurship, and solve problems more effectively.  Additionally,
working with Google, Microsoft, Yahoo. and the World Bank to host Random
Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a unique and valuable collaboration. We are
proud that it is dedicated to using technology to make the world a
better place</p>
<p><strong>What is “open data” and where can I find NASA’s open data?</strong></p>
<p>At NASA, we are constantly looking for new partnerships in order to
accomplish our mission to explore our universe and improve life on
Earth. Sharing our data is vital to this vision. Since NASA's inception,
the agency has archived vast amounts of diverse data from many
exploration missions. Today, the digital landscape has changed, and the
amount of data produced has increased exponentially (NASA now archives
over 4TB of new Earth Science data each day), but the vision itself is
no different.  Sometimes this data is used to help understand our
origins in the universe.  Sometimes we end up with a more extensive view
of the Earth’s climate or learn how to operate aircraft more
effectively. Through collaborations like RHoK, we hope that some of our
data will be used to solve some of humanity’s toughest challenges.</p>
<p>Open data is the acknowledgement that the value of data can continue to
grow, even after its original primary application has been realized.
NASA encourages RHoK developers to build on our open data in new ways to
create cutting edge applications for the benefit of society. By
participating in RHoK events, NASA not only can share its invaluable
information with the RHoK community, but it can inspire the development
of new ideas and the creation of open technology that may can help serve
humanity and further the vision in unpredictable ways.</p>

<p><strong>How can these rapid, focused hackathons serve as a model for new ways
to tackle issues that challenge the agency?</strong></p>
<p>NASA recognizes that innovation is always a numbers game; the more you
do it, the better your chances are of being successful.  No single
breakthrough, no matter how bold or well executed, will pay dividends
forever.  Because there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of
people around the globe looking for opportunities to participate in
challenging and meaningful projects, NASA is intentional about
empowering citizens to become a source of critical skills and knowledge,
as well as sustainable competitive advantage.  What is most important
about RHoK is not the final product, but the process.  RHoK breaks down
barriers that prevent innovation and challenge the way business has
always been done by taking advantage of many of the possibilities
created by working in a networked digital world.</p>
<p><strong>What is a “successful” outcome from a weekend hackathon?</strong></p>
<p>A successful weekend for us is one in which hundreds, if not thousands,
of developers from around the world gather together to invent technology
that didn’t exist 24 hours ago!  It’s about having an idea and
implementing it.  It’s about celebrating the process of innovation that
has made America what it is today.  This is especially relevant in a
time of increased economic and budgetary constraints.</p>
<p><strong>What are some examples of solutions developed at RHoK?</strong></p>
<p>More then 18 RHoK events were held this past weekend.  The NASA OpenGov
team participated in two mainstage locations – Seattle and Philadelphia
- and have summarized the problems and solutions below. The diversity of
these project areas are pleasantly surprising and a great example of the
type of work done at RHoK: climate change, food sources, government
transparency, web anonymity, non-profit visibility, and environmental
hazard awareness. It was exciting to see projects that scoured
everything from local Philadelphia zip codes to the huge amount of daily
NASA climatological data, as well as low- (SMS response) and high- (high
altitude balloons) tech solutions.</p>
<p>Six project areas emerged in RHoK Philadelphia:</p>
<ol>
<li>A platform to verify local ground weather data in Bolivia with NASA
    satellite data
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/real-time-climate-data-comparison-platform</a>)</li>
<li>PhillySNAP: A program to provide nearby sources of healthy food for
    low-income citizens in Philadelphia via SMS along with a ‘healthy
    living tip’
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/phillysnap-healthy-food-sms)</a></li>
<li>Councilmatic: A usable, searchable interface to details of
    Philadelphia City Council legislation
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/councilmatic)</a></li>
<li>A response to the Tor relay challenge (<a href="http://www.eff.org/torchallenge">www.eff.org/torchallenge</a>)
    and social media plugins to update Tor relay status
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/nort-tor-updater)</a></li>
<li>Splash: A site to match non-profit organizations to citizens looking
    to help or donate</li>
<li>Disaster Mapper: A search engine for data on local community hazards
    in Philadelphia
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/disaster-mapper)</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Seven project areas emerged in RHoK Seattle:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://saaraa.recoverywashington.org">SAARAA</a>: Providing situational awareness and rapid damage
    assessments to first responders.
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/problems/saaraa-situational-awareness-and-rapid-assessment-application)</a></li>
<li>eco-Tricorder: A means to take publicly available environmental data
    to the smartphone, and allow users to augment the satellite or other
    global data with local measurements.
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/problems/eco-tricorder)</a></li>
<li>Tethered Towers: Using a tethered high-altitude balloon with
    sensors/wifi attached to it to provide situational awareness to
    ground teams in localized disaster areas.
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/tethered-towers)</a></li>
<li>Open211: A streamlined way to get community maintenance and needs
    information to a centralized searchable database.</li>
<li>MoveFood: An application which matched food surpluses with local
    charities using volunteers as the transportation as needs arose.
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/moving-food)</a></li>
<li>HelpSauce: Enabling small observations of many users to add up to
    large observations by encouraging the use of “!help” and “!sos”
    hashtags on Twitter, then porting those to a localized map of the
    geotags of the tweets.
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/solutions/helpsauce-visualization-emergent-crises-through-tweetin)</a></li>
<li>iRespond: Coordinates the activities of first responders in a robust
    manner via a minimal SMS network.
    <a href="">(http://www.rhok.org/problems/irespond)</a></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>How did the products developed make use of space technology directly
(data, imagery, satellite systems) or indirectly?</strong></p>
<p>Two examples of RHoK projects from this past weekend that incorporated
space data/technology into their solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In RHoK Philadelphia, a team created a “Real Time Climate Data
    Comparison App” to verify local ground weather data in Bolivia with
    NASA satellite data.  The platform allows users to download
    satellite, combine weather data and have access to different input
    for their hydrological models.  The benefit of this platform allows
    local weather institutions in developing countries to make better
    decisions based on climate data.</li>
<li>In RHoK Seattle, the project Eco-Tricorder
    (<a href="http://vimeo.com/24861432">http://vimeo.com/24861432</a>) maps environmental data from EPA
    and/or NASA.  The app gives the option of augmenting that data with
    local citizen scientists.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How can NASA serve as a catalyst for these sort of events across the
Federal government?</strong></p>
<p>We are living in an era of accelerated change that is quietly
threatening the effectiveness and existence of many organizations -
especially including government.  The world around us changing and no
industry is immune including healthcare, entertainment, energy, and
journalism as well as politics and aerospace.  With the new realities of
living in the information age, citizens are increasingly turning to the
Internet as a platform to engage with government, to find relevant and
accessible information and to uncover new opportunities to participate.
RHoK is a reflection of this shifting environment and NASA’s
participation in RHoK can serve as a catalyst for these sorts of events
across the federal government. RHoK is a key element in NASA’s
innovation strategy and events like it will help to reshape the future
of government in the information age. RHoK symbolizes what can happen
when thousands of people collaborate in an open, transparent and
participatory way to change the world in a positive way.</p>
<p><strong>I’m interested in participating or hosting a RHoK event!  Where can I
find out more information?</strong></p>
