</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We’ve all experienced the shift. Meetings confined to the meeting room?
Not so much anymore. Over the past decade, decision-making boards and
widely attended conferences, along with the average team meetings, are
rarely restricted to the people in the physical room. Rather,
teleconferencing technologies promise to save dwindling travel budgets,
connect distributed teams, gather worldwide experts to a one-of-a-kind
summits or simply make it possible for really busy people to be in two
places at once.</p>
<p>“Virtual” participation isn’t new. Years (and years) ago New York
Telephone coined the phrase “<em>we are all connected</em>”, and that
philosophy has held true when businesses used analog desktop
conferencing calls to bring together their shareholders and partners
from around the world. But lately there has been an influx of new
technologies which really push the limit of what’s possible. High-def
video conferencing, shared desktops, and unlimited cellular voice plans
have all tried to convince us to work from home – or cover more meetings
than we have ever thought possible.</p>
<p>[![An old Blackberry leaning against an older see-thru touch-tone

<p><em>And let me tell you, <span style="color: #888888"><span
style="color: #333333">these technolo</span>gies are really
great</span><span style="color: #c0c0c0">, and can</span><span
style="color: #ffffff">make us all……</span></em></p>
<p><em>“Excuse me. Can the speaker please get closer to the mic?”</em></p>
<p>What was that?!?</p>
<p>It’s the statement of desperation; a last resort after maxing out cell
phone volume, finding an empty gate at the airport, or closing the door
to the home office. Not wanting to interrupt - but driven by a need to
be an integral part of the conversation – these words are a verbal
request that a little more <span
style="text-decoration: underline">respect</span> be given to those “on
the net”, not just that the microphone be moved.</p>
<p>But it’s not just voiced information that technology can help transmit.
<em>If you look back to an email that we all received in the past 4-5
months or so, you can see a list of examples of these…</em></p>
<p><em>“Um, yeah… Can’t find it. Do you just have it on a stick?”</em></p>
<p>Ahh, the stick. A portable hard drive that bypasses almost every layer
of security between the core processor of a government computer and 8GB
of unknown content. It’s not the only way to transfer files, but moving
a 500MB movie file in 30 seconds flat (while in a wireless dead zone)
really makes you feel like it’s 2011.</p>
<p><em>"Oh, and please keep this between the group in the room and the few of
us on the phone, but at the end of 2011 we will be releasing the
best <strong>[[beep-BEEP]]</strong>...Uhh… Who just joined?”</em></p>
<p>Whether you're the NASA Administrator, a division chief, astronaut or
intern, everyone makes the same entrance: “<strong><em>beep-BEEP</em></strong>”. For that
matter, they all make same exit: “<strong><em>BEEP-beep</em></strong>”. I wonder if a
physical meeting’s conversation would be different if its participants
put on ski masks before entering the room?  Naaaa…</p>
<p>So maybe the technology isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Maybe we should
just revert to the old ways of getting people in a room together and let
them use their humanly instinctive communication skills. Maybe we’re
just attempting too darn much with technology these days....</p>
<p>...Or maybe technology isn’t the only factor.</p>
<p>Introducing a new tool prompts questions like, “Is it cross-platform?”,
“How secure is it?”, or “How much does it cost?”. Or, when seeking a
tool to fill a gap, simply “What are the requirements?” But it's often
impossible to predict <span
style="text-decoration: underline">how</span> people will use the tool.
As individuals and teams start using a new product, solutions to its
barriers are collectively learned, norms are established based on prior
experiences and current leadership, and eventually a <strong>culture of use</strong>
emerges.</p>
<p><a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Christer-on-EVA-2.jpg"><img alt="Christer Fugelsang on a spacewalk during STS-116" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Christer-on-EVA-2.jpg" /></a>In the past I’ve had a keen
interest in the cultures that are created around communication
technology at NASA, and in the near future I’ll be posting more about
how these specific technologies are used across our Agency, with the
hopes that it creates a <strong>conversation about the culture</strong> of their use.</p>
<p>In many ways, NASA is just like many other large organizations, doing
the best we can to communicate between two boardrooms thousands of miles
apart. In most cases we can compare notes with the real world, since
"there's an app for that" and NASA probably isn't the first one to use
it. But there are some things that separate us from the pack. A lot of
the communications technologies that NASA uses are VERY unique: from the
hundreds of accessible voice loops fed to every Space Shuttle flight
controller’s console, to the strange and sometimes debilitating effect
that microphone placement has on the voice of an astronaut in a
spacesuit. And hey, sorry there, satellite-phone-toting reporter on CNN
- NASA <em>invented</em> speed-of-light lag time.</p>
<p>Each of these applications and challenges, however general to the
world or specific to pushing the frontiers of spaceflight, have a common
thread – they're trying to use state of the art technology to get
information out of one mind and into someone else’s. If the habits,
reactions, and other characteristics of those minds aren’t taken into
account, there’s a good chance the culture of use will foster rejection,
and the technology will be seen as “just another fancy toy”.</p>
<p>So I ask anyone who made it this far down the post: what "fancy toys"
are the most useful to you as a “Virtual Participant”?  Any tools you
can’t live without, or wish had never been invented? Share your stories
in the comments. We’ll pick a few hot topics and expand on their culture
of use here at NASA in a future blog post.</p>
