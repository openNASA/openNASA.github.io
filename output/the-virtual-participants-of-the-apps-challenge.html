</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>We have a problem here at the International Space Station home base:
there are so many locations signed up for this event that our
homepage <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">map</a> is getting cluttered!  OK, so I admit that this is not
a bad problem to have at all.  In fact, we’re incredibly excited about
how much this event has grown since the original <a href="http://goo.gl/GGVXb">press release</a> of
the Apps Challenge on March 9, 2012.  What we can’t demonstrate very
well on our map is all of our virtual participants, so that’s what I
want to write about here today.</p>
<p>Thank you for participating in the International Space Apps Challenge
from your personal location!  We are excited about the collaboration of
individuals around the world on this event; you are making the Apps
Challenge community even more unique and even more spread out across
borders.  Make sure when you start working on the weekend of the Apps
Challenge to check back in to the Virtual Participation page to kick off
your experience with our personal welcome message going to all
participants in every location.</p>
<p><strong>What You Can Do</strong><br />
As a virtual participant we want you to be involved just as if you were
at any other location.  Seek out teams of other virtual participants,
seek out teams at physical locations, make your own team, work on your
own - whatever works best for you!  Here are some thoughts to get you
started on however you want to connect and create amazing solutions to
the challenges.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Organize</strong><br />
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Ahead of Time</span><br />
Create teams to work together on challenges.  You can find information
on who is planning to work on challenges just by checking out the
challenge page.  Anyone who follows the challenge will have their avatar
on the page.  See someone who you think you’d work well with?  Use the
Etherpad (connected with each challenge) to indicate your skills and
willingness to help remotely, and use the Pad’s chat feature to send
messages to others and start collaborating!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">During</span><br />
During the challenge continue to use the Pad or your favorite chat
client to connect to anyone with whom you’ve joined forces.  Yep, it’s
that easy.  If you have a better way to connect that you think others
would be interested in just leave a note on this page’s Pad.  Check back
there frequently to keep in touch with other virtual participants and
the organizing team on logistics of being a virtual participant.</p>
<p><strong>How You Can Connect</strong><br />
We’re hoping you will find each set of Pad notes and Pad chats useful
for both the challenges and for your location.  There are still other
ways to connect as well.  Watch all of the video streams from the global
locations on our UStream Superchannel for the event.  Watch our twitter
feed <a href="http://twitter.com/intlspaceapps">@intlspaceapps</a> (#spaceapps).</p>
<p><strong>How You Produce and Submit Your Work</strong><br />
We want you to think of yourself as just another participant at any
other location - so we have it set up that your solutions will end up in
the same location as theirs.  If you are working virtually just fill in
your “location” for judging as “virtual”.  We are working hard to get a
panel to judge all virtual submissions.  If you worked with a team that
had people in one of the locations just choose where you want the
solution to be judged and have the person in that location post the
solution for your whole team.</p>
<p>Thank you all again for supporting the International Space Apps
Challenge from your location!  We may not have your city marked on our
map but we are so excited that you are participating and bringing
forward all of your skills.</p>
