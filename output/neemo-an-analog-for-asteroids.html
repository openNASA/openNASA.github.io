</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>As you may know, NASA has been working on new concepts for the human
exploration of asteroids.  Across the agency, experts are being called
into action to develop solutions to this new challenge. In particular,
NEEMO-15, slated for October 17th-26th, will test new tools, techniques,
timelining approaches and communication technologies which could be
useful when humans approach asteroids in space. (Go <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/index.html">here</a> to learn
more about the NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operation, or NEEMO.)</p>
<p>The concept of visiting an asteroid challenges our experience like never
before. Gravity on an asteroid is negligible, so walking around on one
isn’t really an option. So anchoring to the surface will probably be
needed. But what to anchor to? They’re all made up of different
materials, some solid metal - others piles of rubble, and many are a
combination of rock, pebbles and dust. To the NEEMO-15 team, weak
gravity and diverse materials present problems whose solutions can be
experimented with on the ocean floor. And what better place to do that,
than the extreme conditions of a multi-day underwater mission at
Aquarius Reef Base in Key Largo.</p>
<p>The NEEMO-15 mission will be in October, and in an engineer’s mind, that
means there’s still time to iterate on designs. Today the engineering
team took some of those designs into the field. One of the devices
tested today was a “spacesuit waist ring simulator”. It acts as the
waist structure of a spacesuit would, except it’s attached to a diver
wearing SCUBA tanks. It holds EVA tools, provides stability against
structure, and even blocks some of the view, just as a spacesuit’s waist
ring would. So today, after constructing this device in labs and
workshops, it was finally time to put it in the water. After estimating
it’s weight and buoyancy (and yes, there were bets on whether it would
float!), it finally had its first taste of the ocean while still
dockside. It checked out, as did the other tools and giant fiberglass
“rockwall” that some of the experiments would mount to. So after the
paperwork was all signed off, the team set out to the reef.</p>

depths."][<img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GEDC0072_small.jpg" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>When arriving at the site - on the same reef but some distance away from
Aquarius - the team lowered the rockwall to the ocean floor. Then,
one-by-one, test subjects, utility divers, and support divers worked
through their checklists and started the clocks on their dive. Astronaut
Mike Gernhardt, the test subject actually in the “rig”, found the
buoyancy to be near perfect (something that can sometimes take 30
minutes to correct), and started the experiments right away. The first
thing that struck everyone was the visibility - the bright sunny, calm
day helped the lighting - but the silt being kicked up made it
impossible to see further than 10 feet. For the most part this didn’t
affect the experiments, and the team pressed ahead. They tested
hand-over-hand translation with anchor points on the rockwall,
foot-restraint ingresses, anchoring in the silt to stabilize the setup,
and using a rigid standoff attached to the waist ring for body
stabilization. All while their time was ticking away - and they were not
able to speak to each other. This was shaping up to be quite the debrief
session.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3336" align="alignleft" width="250" caption="A
test subject evaluates the spacesuit waist ring simulator, and uses a
mask that allows for multiple subjects to talk to each other (although
comm. was not used today)."][<img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GEDC0042_small.jpg" />]<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/GEDC0042_small.jpg">1</a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Once back on the boat, the crew discussed what they had learned. Either
luck or excellent prediction had caused the rig to be perfectly buoyant,
but some stabilization was needed on the waist ring - and the fins -
they proved to be positively buoyant by sending the subject’s feet
sinking after they were removed. Mike was proud to share an interesting
discovery: while holding an excursion line anchored in two locations on
the “asteroid”, one could effectively pull against the surface and walk,
just as if there was gravity! There were other lessons learned, and many
adjustments that would need to be made overnight and in the next few
days, so the team used the trip back to base to rest and, well, talk
more about the big picture.</p>
<p>I guess you could call it an engineering brainstorming session. Not one
with whiteboards, flowcharts and venn diagrams, but just a bunch of
people, passionate about space exploration, talking on a boat. They all
had huge variations in their backgrounds and individual training, and
just witnessed a sampling of how difficult it will be to someday explore
an asteroid. Were the issues they saw today the same ones we’ll face on
an asteroid? No, but some of them were strikingly analogous: The
near-zero visibility had a similar effect to what could happen after
touching the surface of a dusty asteroid. Body movements made on the
ocean floor while “almost” neutrally buoyant are similar to what
astronauts will face when moving across the surface of an uncharted
asteroid. And how will we know what anchoring techniques will be
effective? As the team neared the base on the shores of Key Largo, their
conversation shifted to the varieties of anchoring tools we use here on
Earth. Not knowing what kind of surfaces are out there is making us
consider a variety of approaches from many “analogous” situations here
on Earth: rock climbing, foundation repair, even drift diving.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3331" align="alignright" width="250"

<p>This was just a snapshot of one day of experiments in preparation for
the NEEMO-15. The countless hours that go into getting ready for a
mission are one of the many similarities to NASA’s space missions.
Significant is the fact that NEEMO-15 will mimic something that has
never been done by humans before. The question could be posed: Isn’t
visiting an asteroid just a combination of what we have done in the
past? Combine the weightlessness, tethering and translation techniques
on the International Space Station, and then add to that all of the
knowledge gained putting human feet on another world during the Apollo
program. Right?</p>
<p>Not quite. The final discussions of the evening (after hours of
replanning, retooling and regrouping) were about how asteroid
exploration is definitely the most challenging of both worlds. Exploring
a possibly dusty, wholly unknown, completely uncertified, essentially
weightless, “surface” of an asteroid, will definitely be more
challenging then combining the sum of our lessons learned from the Moon
and ISS. Those experiences under our belt will be the basis of much that
NASA does in the future - but we all agree it’s a good thing we’re
learning how to hone our skills, here on Earth.</p>
