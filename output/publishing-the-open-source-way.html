</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Developing open.nasa.gov was, to say the least, an interesting process.
Born out of an effort by <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/skytland/" title="Nick Skytland">Nick Skytland</a> over five years ago, we first
began drafting some ideas on how the site will look, feel, and function
last fall. The preliminary designs we created were the designs we were
working with until roughly 48 hours ago (less than two days before the
launch of the site). For the most part, the site was very “traditional
NASA” - starscape background, bold red and blue colors scheme, and a ton
of functionality that wasn’t really necessary but that we thought would
be nice to have. While sitting at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23oscon">OSCON 201</a>1, however, we realized
something. If we really, really wanted open.NASA to be a new, fresh look
on what’s happening at NASA, we needed to so something bold. So, we
deleted all of our work and started from scratch. That’s right - this
entire site was created in just a few (crazy, late-night) hours. Doing
all this work in such a short time span, however, wouldn’t have been
possible without a little bit of help. I’m talking, of course, about
open source.</p>
<p>Open Source is big at NASA. It’s one of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/open-source-development.html">flagship initiatives</a> in
our <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open">Open Government plan</a>. Last spring, we hosted our first ever
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/open-source-development.html">Open Source Summit</a>. It drew 700+ attendees to
discuss the issues and solutions about developing open source
applications at the agency. Our most popular open source application,
<a href="http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov">World Wind</a>, has had millions of downloads. open.NASA is no exception
- it’s built entirely on open source and Software as a Service
technologies, meaning you can take everything you see here today and do
it on your own. Here’s how:</p>
<p>Server Platform<br />
<strong>LAMP<br />
</strong>open.NASA is hosted on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP stack</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a>,
<a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a>, <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>). All of these are open source applications that are
near-universal. If you’ve built a website before, it’s most likely been
on LAMP.</p>
<p><strong>Wordpress</strong><br />
The core of open.NASA is <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress 3.2.1</a>, an open source content
management system approved for use by both NASA and the <a href="http://www.apps.gov">General
Services Administration</a>. We made no tweaks to the Wordpress core for
the site - it grabbed from the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing/Updating_WordPress_with_Subversion">SVN repository</a> and set up out of the
box.</p>
<p><strong>Theme</strong><br />
The site is running a modified version of <a href="http://www.landaureece.com/">Landau Reece’</a>s free
<a href="https://github.com/landaureece/Protean/blame/master/archive.php">Protean theme</a> for Wordpress. We made a few changes to the theme to
create a unique look and feel to the site. We really like the design due
to how clean and simple it presents the content. Plus, each post allows
for customization by the author to give everyone a bit of personality.</p>
<p><strong>Disqus</strong><br />
Our comments are driven by <a href="http://disqus.com/">Disqus</a>, a GSA approved commenting system
that connects conversations happening across the web.</p>
<p><strong>UserVoice</strong><br />
We want to hear from you! We’ve opened a <a href="http://nasa.uservoice.com">UserVoice account</a> to get
your feedback on our site, our projects, and hear your ideas for new
ways NASA can be more participatory, collaborative, and transparent with
the public. Be sure to also let us know via UserVoice if you see any
errors or bugs on the site. None of us are web developers by day, and we
definitely want to know if there’s something that need to be fixed.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope you enjoy open.NASA. Feel free to use anything you see
on this site - we want you to benefit from the wonders of open source,
too! open.NASA is a constantly evolving platform. Our goal is to make
this site a way for you to learn how we’re working every day to make
NASA more accessible to the world. Your feedback and ideas are critical
in helping us do our jobs better. This is your space agency, and we hope
you are as excited as we are for the future. Let’s do great things
together.</p>
