</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><em>We need your help!</em> There are a number of exciting space-related panels
proposed for next year’s <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">South by Southwest</a> festival in Austin. SXSW
is a community-driven event and voting accounts for 30% of the
decision-making process for any given programming slot. The selection
process is extremely competitive and this year there are 3600 proposed
panels, of which only 500 get selected. The more votes we submit for the
space panels, the more likely a panel related to space exploration will
be included in the final SxSW program. Voting ends on Friday, August 31
(11:59 PM CST), so please vote <em>today</em>!</p>
<p>To help you out, we’ve put together a directory for all the space
related panels. This includes panels that have NASA representation as
well others that may not necessarily be NASA affiliated.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/504">@NASA: The User Experience of a Space Station</a></p>
<p>What kind of software would you design to support astronauts aboard a
space station? Well, in this session, we'll show you. We are two NASA
designers who want to share a little about what we do, the situations we
design for, and where UX in space is heading. Here's a few of the topics
we'll talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The history of user experience in space. In the Apollo and Shuttle
eras, most things happened on paper. And, for better or worse, many of
the design strategies they used in their notebooks with are still in use
today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The state of art aboard the Space Station. Crew members currently rely
on a bevy of acronym loaded tools (OSTPV, IPV, OCAMS) to do their job.
We'll take a look at what these tools do.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What's next. If you watched the attached video, you know there's room
for improvement. We're rethinking the software experience both aboard
the station and in mission control. Our hope is simple: to make NASA
software cool again. We'll give you a sneak peek.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>2. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/5866">Ask NASA Astronauts Live from Space</a></p>
<p>Ask the astronauts via a live video downlink directly from the
International Space Station about using technology to communicate with
us down here on Earth. The nation's space agency has embraced the use of
social media to reach out, engaging new audiences in new ways and giving
people behind-the-scenes access to areas rarely seen by the public.
Communicating from space is no exception to this pattern of openness. By
using tweets, blog posts and streamed video interviews with groups
across the world, the astronauts living and working on orbit have a
unique vantage point in which to conduct science-altering experiments,
encourage the next generation to study STEM in school and to open a door
that rekindles the dreamer in all of us. Communicate directly with some
of the astronauts aboard the space station during this panel and explore
all the ways that you can connect with what's going on way up there from
all the way down here.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4251">Apollo 13: America's First Galactic Hackathon</a></p>
<p>It was April of 1970. Apollo 13 was going to be the third space mission
to land on the moon. But on its way, nearly two hundred thousand miles
from home and hours away from landing on the Moon, an explosion occurred
on the spacecraft that changed history. Teams in Mission Control had to
respond quickly to save the crew - and hopefully the mission. Apollo 13
was the world’s first galactic hackathon. Although some of the most
brilliant minds in the country were working on these problems, with so
many factors that could go wrong, many felt the crew would not be coming
home. Some observers gave the crew a one in 10 chance of survival. The
mission was not easy... but in a very short amount of time, and against
all odds, collaborative teams of engineers, developers and subject
matter experts invented the technology to return the crew safely to
earth. Join us for a discussion about America’s first galactic hackathon
and explore the leadership lessons from Apollo’s failed success.</p>

<p>4. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/5183">Get Physical: Making Space Data Real on Earth</a></p>
<p>Most of us dream about space exploration - but haven't yet touched those
stars ourselves. Can earth science and other open data connect us
physically and personally to the exploration of the universe? It could
be that the Space Station is overhead; it could be that a solar storm
has exceeded a threshold; or that in space it is very very cold. Can we
adorn and decorate our lives with what we've learned from space? Can we
bring data close to us to engage us physically in far-off exploration-
and let those interactions to change our digital lives? We'll look at a
variety of real space data and the international, cross-disciplinary
collaborations that can discover its secrets. There is a certain thrill
that you feel when you know that you are connected to something. From
our earliest use of technology to synchronize and connect communities we
have used simple interactions and design to inform people, providing
connections to things and places beyond ourselves. Let's see what's
possible.</p>

<p>​5. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/5785">Making it to Mars</a></p>
<p>We, humans, will go to Mars. Depending on who you ask, it may be in 20
years, or 200. The Mars shot of tomorrow will not look like the Moon
shot of yesterday. The future necessitates a much tighter balance of
human-centered design, technological prowess, and social
responsibility. With the panelists, we invite you to explore this living
network, engage in an ongoing discussion of design in space, hone your
conceptual skills, and create a collective vision of our future in
space.</p>

<p>​6. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6513">The Explorer Next Door: NASA, Women and YOU!</a></p>
<p>This panel is about YOU: The student, retiree, hobbyist, underdog,
and/or dreamer donating time, resources, and creativity to explore the
unknown. Instead of describing opportunities available for women to
engage with NASA, this conversation will feature a diverse selection of
space geeks and citizen scientists who will share personal successes &amp;
failures as they break barriers &amp; stereotypes in order to better
understand the world around us. Sure, there might be an astronaut,
engineer and a few NASA employees in attendance, but the discussion and
purpose of this panel is to connect female makers, problem solvers, and
hackers with the needs and people of OUR Agency. To sustain dialogue,
attendees will be invited to an exclusive post-event TweetUp to address
participatory exploration questions. Participants will also be
encouraged to share imagery for a tool that will be launched in time for
SXSW featuring women citizen scientists on the Women@NASA website.</p>

<p>7. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/6687">Startup NASA</a></p>
<p>Tired of the constant stream of buzzwords and platitudes thrown around
organizations in an attempt to create a sense of innovation and
intrapreneurship? Do new ideas, bold endeavors, and a spirit of
adventure sound more exciting than a corporate retreat to discuss
upcoming performance metrics? Three years ago, a small group of
unconventional thinkers at NASA gathered together with a simple goal -
to change the way we look at exploration of the universe and to take the
best of startup culture and implant it in a large, traditional
government bureaucracy.</p>
<p>Hear from some of these thinkers about their thoughts on organizational
culture change, the future of the Nation's space program, and discuss
how you, too, can be a exploration trailblazer in your organization.</p>

<p>8. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4900">Crowdsourcing the Space Frontier</a></p>
<p>Space promises enormous opportunities to those who first explore it. Can
we all be part of this endeavor? Will you be part of it?</p>
<p>With the arrival of the crowd-sourcing and open-source movements, never
before have humans had the opportunity to transform and build entire
industries in such short time frames and with mass participation. We
have seen Linux, Firefox, Wikipedia and millions of app developers
demonstrate this in the software world. With the arrival of the Makers
movement and recent initiatives to crowd-source, crowd-fund and
open-source space technology we may be seeing this same trend in space.
This session explores the history, opportunities and challenges for
entrepreneurs, companies, nonprofits and governments wishing to lead the
way in this unexpected frontier. Help us answer: Why is this trend
happening? Is it here to stay? Is it viable? Can we create a
collaborative global space industry? Who, if anyone, will emerge as the
primary catalysts for this industry?</p>
<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/4900"><img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>​9. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3025">News 2.0</a></p>
<p>Traditional media is slowly transforming. Reporters and beats are being
cut. Newsrooms are being trimmed back. Is it time to kill the press
release? Is it time to shift your news release paradigm to be digital
products first? NASA invites public affairs and new media professionals
to join us for an engaging exchange of ideas about how to continue
spreading the word about your organizations' programs, mission and
projects, given the realities of the modern media market. We've been
experimenting in this changing media landscape, and we want to hear your
thoughts and ideas about the future of communications going forward. The
rise of web technologies and social media engagement have forever
altered the relationship between organizations', the media that have
previously spread their news, and the audiences you are trying to reach
-- so how do you continue to do this effectively?</p>
<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3025"><img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>10. <a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/3578">The Hacker’s Guide to the Galaxy</a></p>
<p>Don't panic: the next big science revolution isn't just for asteroid
miners or CERN scientists. Just as science fiction has often shown the
way to future inventions, the act of hacking is now generating
prototypes that act as footholds for future explorations, discoveries
and epiphanies in science. This presentation takes you on a tour of our
universe (from black holes and dark matter to exoplanets and the search
for extraterrestrial intelligence) and shows you how you can actively
explore the final frontier through getting excited and making things.</p>

<p>​11. [The Death of .gov and the Rise of Diverse Engagement ][]</p>
<p>Technology in government isn't just about putting up a new .gov website,
or creating a new platform - it can't be, because the public demands
better services where they already are engaging, and they need these
services now. This panel will get to the bottom of not just the future
of citizen engagement, but the movement to deliver on the promise of
open source, mobile citizen engagement right now by any means necessary.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" />][The Death of .gov and the Rise of Diverse Engagement ]</p>
<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/10152">12. INTERNET, I AM IN YOU! A NASA Rover Lands Online</a></p>
<p>A tweet that will live in infamy, "GALE CRATER, I AM IN YOU" heralded a
new era of space exploration and conversation between NASA and the
general public. As the Curiosity Mars rover touched down on the Red
Planet, the teams at NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were sharing
the historic event on Twitter, Facebook, Ustream, YouTube, Google+, Xbox
Live, mobile apps and in-real-life landing parties. The Mars Science
Laboratory mission propelled the interest and attention of the nation
back onto the space program — all while competing against the London
Olympics and the presidential campaign. And what the public saw was a
hipper, more accessible NASA — one that generated an avalanche of memes
from Unimpressed Curiosity to Mohawk Guy. What went on behind the scenes
with this campaign that helped NASA capture the public's attention, and
can NASA and JPL keep the interest and excitement going?</p>
<p><a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/10152"><img alt="" src="http://sxsw.com/sites/default/files/PP_VOTE_IDEA_SXSW2013.jpg" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>It's exciting to see that NASA has so much more than just space
exploration to share, but that we are truly pushing boundaries in
communication, engagement and technology development. Can't wait to see
you in Austin.</p>                </article>
