</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>On September 11, 1962, President Kennedy visited the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/marshall/history/index.html">George C. Marshall
Spaceflight Center</a> where <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/history/features/vonbraun.html">Dr. Wernher von Braun</a> showed him a model
of the Saturn C-5 rocket, the “vehicle designed to fulfill your promise
to put a man on the moon by the end of this decade.” The next day, in an
<a href="http://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Ready-Reference/JFK-Speeches/Address-at-Rice-University-on-the-Nations-Space-Effort-September-12-1962.aspx">audacious speech at Rice University</a>, the president marshaled the
nation’s resolve to accomplish just that.</p>
<p>“<em>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not
because they are easy, but because they are hard…</em>”</p>
<p>The times were uncertain. Differences between the United States and the
Soviet Union played out in a cold war that was a constant presence,
propelling the intense rivalry that resulted in <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/people/galleries/armstrong.html">Neil Armstrong’s</a>
iconic moment as the first human to step on to the surface of the Moon.</p>
<p><em>“…that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are
unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win...”</em></p>
<p>Kennedy’s speech became the pivot for the development of the technology
necessary to achieve his goals in the unforgiving and harsh frontier of
space.</p>
<p><em>“We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass
destruction, but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.”</em></p>
<p>Ultimately it led to cooperation, and the realization that the <em>promise
of rapidly emerging technology can only be fully realized through
collaboration.</em>Today, six humans from three different countries are
living and working onboard the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html">International Space Station</a> and serve
as ambassadors of all people of Earth. I was personally affected from
the technology that grew out of President Kennedy’s speech when I had
the privilege of traveling to the ISS twice, launching in 2008 as part
of an international crew onboard the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/shuttleoperations/orbiters/discovery-info.html">American Space Shuttle
Discovery</a>, and then launching in 2011 as part of an international
crew onboard a <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/soyuz/">Russian Soyuz spacecraft</a>. During the 164 days of my
second mission, I spent much of my free time<a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/106819891249477893372/photos/116214152295449083654/albums/5648104889925481025">documenting what I saw 250
miles below</a>.</p>
<p>As I looked back at our home, I faced the sobering contradiction of the
incredible beauty of our planet with the unfortunate realities of life
for a significant number of Earth’s inhabitants. I launched into space
with the belief that we have sufficient technology and resources to
solve many, if not all, the problems facing our planet. During my time
in space I often found myself contemplating the question, if we have
ample technology and resources to solve problems facing our world, why
do so many problems remain? I tried to capture what I believe is the
answer to this question in this video:</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/benefits/index.html">technological benefits</a> provided by the space program and
international cooperation are such an integral part of our daily lives
on Earth, it is hard to comprehend just how bold President Kennedy’s
challenge to go to Moon was 50 years ago. Think about it, we had barley
stuck our toe in the ocean of space, we had not even learned to stand,
yet but we were going to sprint.</p>
<p><em>“But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the
moon, 240,000 miles away from the control station in Houston, a giant
rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made
of new metal alloys, some of which have not yet been invented, capable
of standing heat and stresses several times more than have ever been
experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest
watch, carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance,
control, communications, food and survival, on an untried mission, to an
unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth, re-entering
the atmosphere at speeds of over 25,000 miles per hour, causing heat
about half that of the temperature of the sun--almost as hot as it is
here today--and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before
this decade is out--then we must be bold.”</em></p>
<p>The problems facing us all today require the same boldness that was
required to reach the Moon and return to Earth safely. Fifty years ago,
before President Kennedy left Marshall Spaceflight Center for Rice
University, Dr. Braun turned to him and said, “By God, we’ll do it.”</p>
<p>Solving the problems facing our world requires that we all stand
together and refuse to accept the status quo on our planet. It requires
that we all commit to work together so that our planet is not only
visibly beautiful, but a planet where life is also beautiful for all. In
the spirit of boldness that brought humans to another world, let us all
work hard to set aside our differences and work together toward our
common goals.</p>
<p><em>“Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to
die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said,
"Because it is there." Well, space is there, and we're going to climb
it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge
and peace are there. And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's
blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure on
which man has ever embarked.”</em> President John F. Kennedy</p>                </article>
