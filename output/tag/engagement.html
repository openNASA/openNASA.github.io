</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Space is well-represented at #SXSWi, with a number of interactive
sessions (not to mention a big flock of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=9YZ_yLQadBg">angry space birds…</a>) <strong>Here
are just some of the reasons why NASA is here at #SXSWi and some of the
ways you can engage <em>your</em> space agency.</strong></p>
<p>We honestly believe that everyone has a contribution they can make to
the exploration mission, and we have some amazing opportunities coming
up where you can connect with other software developers and creative
thinkers to work on short-term projects that could change the world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A License to RHoK</strong> (<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10214">5pm, Sunday, March 11</a>) will highlight
<a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random Hacks of Kindness</a>, a global initiative to create practical
open source solutions to humanity’s toughest challenges. NASA is
joining with partners Google and Microsoft as well as Secondmuse to
share how you can change the world with your mad hacking skills, what
you can expect at a marathon coding event, what kind of technology
success stories have come out of RHoK… and how you can join us for the
upcoming <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps Challenge</a> in April and for RHoK
Global in June.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our mission is to explore the unknown… and #SXSW has lots of people,
ideas, and technologies that could help us do that better. We are ready
to share some of the latest developments in our technology portfolios
and how the government is using prizes to help incentivize breakthrough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the session <strong>Government as a Catalyst: Prizes for Tech
Innovation</strong>(<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP11048">11am, Tuesday, March 13</a>), we’ll look at some new
approaches to technology innovation. Federal agencies have recently
been given the authority by Congress to sponsor competitions for
individuals, groups, and companies to develop new ideas and technology
innovations for a chance to win potentially lucrative prizes. These
competitions can range from new mobile outreach technologies to
web-based data analytics tools to even vehicle-to-vehicle
communications; the government is looking for breakthrough
technologies from the minds of the most innovative and forward
thinking Americans, many of whom are at SXSW. You’ll hear some of our
more interesting prizes and how effective they have been in
stimulating tech development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe in <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/">connection</a> – in some pretty unconventional ways. We
are looking forward to sharing stories about how we are engaging the
public to get them involved in the coolest mission on Earth – and in
space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Out of this World Engagement (</strong><a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP13786">11am, Sunday, March 11</a>) will
feature a conversation between the nation’s space agency and the
world’s largest museum and research complex about how they have
embraced the use of social media to reach out, engage new audiences,
engage existing audiences in new ways, and give the public
behind-the-scenes access.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We love great movies as much as anyone else – but we also know that a
good film isn’t necessarily a true story.  We’ll give you the real
lowdown about asteroids (along with our friend the <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/">Bad Astronomer</a>)
and talk about how we can get the real data out there, and tell an even
better story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2012: You Bet Your Asteroid the World Won’t End</strong> (<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP9535">9:30am, Monday,
March 12</a>) will take on the Internet factor in the cause and cure of
2012 hysteria, looking at how urban legends spread, data gets shared,
and myths get debunked online. While we’re at it, we’ll see how NASA
JPL’s Near Earth Objects office and the amateur astronomy community
keeps an eye on asteroids, comets, and other low-flying space rocks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With citizen engagement as a core value, we are highly invested in
empowering space-lovers everywhere to spur exploration. Our goal remains
to see how people will literally change the world with the vision,
inspiration, and engagement of exploration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The session <strong>How to Win Friends and Influence Space Exploration</strong>
(<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP12424">12:30pm, Sunday, March 11</a>) will focuses on “brains as valuable
assets to take over the world.” Learn why people get so passionately
committed to space exploration, how they became connected over the
Internet, and what they’ve created to make “measurable change toward a
more awesome tomorrow.” The grassroots “space tweep” community will
give you strategies about community ownership and empowerment to turn
ideas into action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Social media strategy at NASA has grown leaps and bounds since
<a href="https://twitter.com/#!/marsphoenix">@MarsPhoenix</a> told the story of his long journey to the red planet,
and we are excited to share practical lessons about how we have
integrated a variety of social media platforms across a large
organization and continued to see them grow and mature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The strategy of <strong>NASA’s Mission Possible: Tweeting Thru Space</strong>
(<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10789">5pm, Sunday, March 11</a>) is all about extending the space
“experience.” We’ll share about tying the social and physical
experience together with events like <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/index.html">Tweetups</a>, how to get social
media buy-in across large diverse organizations, how to manage high
volume interactions, and how to keep that momentum going after the big
event.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The community’s commitment to space exploration continues to be deepened
with local education and engagement events like <a href="http://spaceup.org/">SpaceUp</a> – and ideas
grow out of these events that could change the way we do outreach. These
nontraditional approaches to outreach will help shape the future of a
changing space program.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SpacePoints: Space Outreach at Ludicrous Speed</strong>(<a href="http://schedule.sxsw.com/2012/events/event_IAP10551">12:30pm, Monday,
March 12</a>) will feature space-related outreach and engagement
strategies developed from a group of web developers, aerospace
scientists and engineers, and people who dream of living in space.
These “space geeks” are sharing SpacePoints and are increasing
awareness about space policy, increasing funding to aerospace-related
research (commercial and government), and having fun playing to win!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why have we come to Austin? We are excited to share our ideas and
experiences, and learn from others who are pushing the envelope, trying
new things, and discovering new frontiers. Ideas are born in places like
#SXSW, and it is going to be an amazing week of connecting with others
who are refining technologies, writing policies, and transforming
cultures.  We’re here because we want to talk to you – and we want to
listen.</p>

I enter the classroom about ten minutes before my scheduled start time.

presentation and setting out my materials I think through the upcoming
