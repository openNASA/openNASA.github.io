<p><em>The key principles of Open Government – participation, collaboration
and transparency - have been embedded in NASA operations for more than
50 years. As NASA continues to implement the Open Government
Directive, we have developed version 2.0 of our Open Government Plan
to serve as a model – not a manual – for what a more open NASA might
look like today. Our Plan collects the many new activities that
exemplify the evolution of openness in NASA’s policy, technology and
culture – and provides citizens the opportunity to respond and
engage.</em></p>

<p>[<img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Infographic-Icon-134x300.png" title="Infographic Icon" />][]Two years ago this April, NASA released version 1.0 of its Open
Government Plan. The Plan set forth a bold and aggressive vision for
NASA. The Plan included 3 flagship initiatives and 147 goals across
twenty-organizations. For the past two years, NASA has been hard at work
implementing the Plan. We've captured the highlights in an updated
[infographic][<img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Infographic-Icon-134x300.png" title="Infographic Icon" />] and are very proud of all that the Agency has
accomplished in such a short amount of time.</p>
<p>We are excited to release <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan">version 2.0</a> of our Plan <em>today</em>. We used
this milestone to sharpen our focus and commitment to Open Government.
We see Open Government as the responsibility of every person who works
at NASA and we take seriously the principles of <em>participation</em>,
<em>collaboration</em> and <em>transparency</em> in all that we do.</p>
<p>[<br />
][]</p>
<p><a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan">Version 2.0 of our Open Government Plan</a> is meant to serve
as a model – not a manual – for what an open government might look like.
The Plan includes a new <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/nasa-web-environment/">Flagship Initiative</a> that will take a fresh
look at the NASA web architecture and processes to manage content in
order build an accessible, participatory and transparent web environment
based on open and interoperable standards. We will also push forward our
<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-data/">Open Data</a> and <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-source-software/">Open Source</a>efforts, as well as add a new category
called "<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/technology-accelerators/">Technology Accelerators</a>" that takes a look at NASA's
commitment to technology development and innovation.</p>
<p>[<img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Cover-Icon1.jpg" title="Cover-Icon" />][]We recognize that as NASA continues to implement the Open
Government Directive, and as the values of Open Government are further
embedded into our core mission, new activities and anecdotal successes
that embody values of transparency, participation, and collaboration
will be developed. In fact, Open Government principles are already
evident in numerous activities underway throughout the Agency. One of
the most exciting additions to the Plan with version 2.0 is a new open
<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/directory/">directory</a> that aims to capture these activities in one place for the
benefit of all. The goal of the <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/directory/">directory</a> is to communicate the many
opportunities NASA has to actively involve individuals as contributors
to and collaborators with NASA’s research, science, and exploration
activities. At the time of publication, the directory is populated with
over <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/category/activity/">100 participatory, collaborative and transparent activities</a>.</p>
<p>Version 2.0 of our Plan represents the next generation of Open
Government at NASA. It is our hope that the new NASA Open Government
Plan will not only provide a strong multi-dimensional <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/framework/">framework</a> of
technology, policy, and culture, but will create new opportunities for
YOU to participate in the NASA's mission to <em>pioneer the future</em>. We
encourage you to visit the new online version of the plan by visiting
<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan">http://open.nasa.gov/plan</a>. If you are looking for a good place to
start, check out the "<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/graphical-summary/">Graphical Summary</a>"!</p>
<p>Finally, a few words of acknowledgment. There are so many people around
the agency who have worked very hard to make Version 2.0 of NASA's Open
Government Plan a possibility. Open Government is definitely a team
sport at NASA, and without the contributions of so many, releasing
something like this would be simply impossible (especially in a
government agency). Thank you to all of you who contributed to the
second version of the Plan, including - Roopangi Kadakia, Adrian
Gardner, Myra Bambacus, Beth Beck, Stephanie Stockman, Jeff Hayes,
Jennifer Gustetic, Jeff Davis, Cindy Rando, Jason Crusan, Miriam
Brown-Lam, Mabel Matthews, Fatima Senghore, Jasper Wolfe, David Mayer,
Lynn Heimerl, Scott Goodwin, Susan Minor, Sasi Pillay, and Allison
Wolff. The plan represents some of the most innovative and visionary
things the Agency is doing. Thank you to our leadership - Deborah Diaz,
Sasi Pillay, Linda Cureton, Nadine Tremper, Beth <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/graphical-summary/"><img alt="" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Visual-Icon-219x300.jpg" title="Visual-Icon" /></a>Robinson, and Mark Hill - for your unending support.</p>
<p>I might be biased, but a special thanks goes to the NASA Open Government
Team who has worked effortlessly to develop this plan.  There is no way
to account for all the all nighters you have pulled, the weekends you
have worked, the classes you have missed or the emails you have answered
even while you pretended to be on vacation. You truly deserve a special
acknowledgement for your work - which most of the time - happens behind
the scenes. Thank you <span
style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>especially</em></span> to <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/adllewellyn/">Ali
Llewellyn</a>, for your leadership, patience and endless passion for all
that we do.  Without Ali, this plan would never be. Thank you <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/sherron/">Sean
Herron</a>, for your determination to make every open government website
the best, most secure, modern and accessible website, ever imaginable.
Thank you Samantha Snabes for helping us with the finer details of the
directory. Thank you <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/drbonill/">Dennis Bonilla</a>, Tate Srey, and Kate Jeremeko
for the amazing artwork. And thank you <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/cgerty/">Chris Gerty</a>, <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/weshagh/">William
Eshagh</a>, <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/author/kpaintin/">Kristen Painting</a> and <a href="http://fragileoasis.org/bloggernauts/Astro_Ron/">Ron Garan</a> for continuing to
juggle everything else do in Open Government the past few weeks. The
development of this plan is truly a testament to what a small,
committed, talented and passionate team can do together.</p>
