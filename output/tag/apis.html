</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>NASA has a LOT of interesting data. NASA’s commitment to open data
expands the audience for the vast body of knowledge captured in nearly
100 years of U.S. aeronautics and space data. Developers, technologists,
entrepreneurs, citizen scientists and many others can contribute
directly to the exploration of space and Earth by helping to create new
ways of looking at this data. Additionally, the release of
administrative and procedural information from within NASA enables
researchers and analysts to understand more about the inner workings of
NASA as well as allow our own employees to better understand other
functions of our Agency. We are continually working to improve
accessibility to this data and incentivizing the use of government data
by citizens. One way that NASA data can be made more available online is
through an “<em>application programming interface</em>” or API. While the name
may be intimidating, you probably use APIs every day. APIs bring us
real-time news, weather, and photosharing. APIs feed the content to many
of your favorite website or mobile applications. In the past few years,
APIs have experienced an exponential increase in popularity and usage.</p>
<p>Earlier today, the U.S. General Services Administration's DigitalGov
University hosted a webinar titled "Case Studies from the Federal
Register, NASA, and GSA" with the purpose of discussing the use of API's
in government. Below is the short presentation based on some examples
from NASA.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>What is an API?</strong></p>
<p>An API, or “<em>Application Program Interface</em>”, is a set of routines and
protocols that provide building blocks for computer programmers and
application developers to build software applications. In its simplest
form, an API makes raw data accessible in a machine readable format so
you can create any application you can dream of. In the past, APIs were
largely associated with computer operating systems and desktop
applications. In recent years though, we have seen the emergence of Web
APIs (Web Services).</p>
<p><strong>What is NASA doing in regards to APIs?</strong></p>
<p>For NASA, data is at the heart of what we do but NASA is really just
getting started in it's mission to expand the API universe. We recognize
that there is a need to organize and make sense of the ever-increasing
amount of tools and data catalogs that are publicly available on NASA’s
many websites, and so we created a directory that lists the publicly
available datasets and serves to streamline the process for posting
these datasets on data.gov. The directory includes information and
direct links to hundreds of datasets. In August 2011, we launched a data
API around the online archive of NASA data sets. The <a href="http://www.data.nasa.gov">data.nasa.gov</a>
API provides a RESTful interface, with responses in JSON for the NASA
data archives.</p>
<p><em>But this is just the beginning.</em></p>
<p><strong>A Wide Open Field</strong></p>
<p>There is a wealth of data available at data.nasa.gov. We have a lot of
work to do to build more meaningful, focused APIs that deliver the many
kinds of data we produce, and we would love your help! There is a huge
opportunity for anyone with interest to help NASA make its data more
accessible and derive new meaning from existing datasets through APIs.
Whatever you can dream of doing with this public data, it’s yours to
use, and we encourage you to get involved.</p>
<p>As part of NASA's response to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/agency/digitalstrategy/index.html">Digital Government Strategy</a>, we
are charged with creating at least two new APIs in the coming year. We
would love to hear your thoughts and ideas on what data you would like
us to focus on. We also hope to create more opportunities for YOU to get
directly involved. We'll be offering a few new API related challenges at
upcoming mass collaboration events this next year, including <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random
Hacks of Kindness</a> or the second <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps
Challenge</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Crowdsourcing API Development</strong></p>
<p>The idea of developing an API to access an already complicated data set
or service may sound overwhelming. The good news is that the most
creative work often comes from outside the walls of government. Living
in the information age has its benefits and one of them is that there
are thousands of people around the world who can help you. In April, we
issued a few API related challenges at the International Space Apps
Challenge and the results were impressive. A virtual team of three
developers created <a href="http://exoapi.com/">ExoAPI</a> - a powerful tool that provides access to
exoplanet data through a simple RESTful API. The video below is not only
inspirational, but serves as an example of what can happen when we
engage citizens in NASA's mission.</p>
