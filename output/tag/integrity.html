</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/abdalati_bio.html">NASA Chief Scientist Waleed Abdalati</a> reminded me so eloquently
yesterday about what is so powerful about what we do here at NASA.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The iconic success of NASA is planted firmly on three foundational
elements: innovation, inspiration, and integrity. While innovation and
inspiration are visible through our endeavors and successes, <em>it is
our integrity – how we work, and our commitment to excellence and
openness – that earns us the trust of the public and ensures our
continued ability to inspire and innovate.</em>  Integrity is woven
throughout the fabric of NASA.  It has always been there. And each and
every day, we recommit ourselves to keeping it there.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(You can read more about the Agency's framework for scientific
integrity <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/news/reports/sif.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>Innovation</strong> is what NASA is known for. Every day we are asking new
questions and solving problems in new ways. We are <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/nasa@work.html">encouraging
innovation internally</a> and building <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/ntl/">innovative communities
externally</a>, incubating technologies that are <a href="http://launch.org/">deeply committed to
making a better world</a>. We are developing <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/partnership/innovation/index.html">innovative partnerships</a>
all the time to encourage cross-pollination of research and ideas.</p>
<p>Almost all of us have wondered about life beyond Earth or dreamt of
flying in space at some point in our lives;<strong>inspiration</strong> is the part
that seems to come so easily. Who isn't inspired by <a href="http://news.discovery.com/space/big-pic-psychedelic-star-trails-iss-pettit-120514.html">this</a>? Or
<a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/newui/blog/viewpostlist.jsp?blogname=letters">this</a>? Or <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/image_feature_2249.html">this</a>? NASA gives us <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/Eyes/">perspective on our planet</a> -
and on <a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/">what it means to be human</a> - every single day. Every time I
watch brave explorers suit up and climb onto a rocket to go to space,
like I did <a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/newui/blog/viewpostlist.jsp?blogname=acaba">just this week</a>, I get excited again about what is and can
be possible.</p>
<p><strong>Integrity</strong>, however, is the commitment we make every single day.
Integrity is doing the hard work of putting things into the light -
documenting ideas, insuring safety, working through processes, truly
engaging citizens. It's what allows crewmembers to ["strap themselves to
a few million pounds of explosives and trusting that everything will
work as planned."][] Sometimes it means <a href="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/blog/waynehalesblog/posts/post_1237212199973.html">asking hard questions about our
own issues</a>. Integrity is insuring that not just the crew but the
<em>public</em> can trust what is behind the decisions we are making - and
committing to appropriately share that information with them. The
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ogc/about/space_act1.html">National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958</a>, as amended, stipulates
that NASA shall “provide for the widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results
thereof.” And as the policy notes: <em>unless a determination is made that
public dissemination of  information must be prohibited or restricted,
NASA information is made available to the public</em>. (<a href="http://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_2200_002C_&amp;page_name=main&amp;search_term=2200%2E2">NPR 2200.2, Section
4.5.1</a>)</p>
<p>I fully believe that this is why <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/">openness</a> is so important at NASA as
we stay focused on such an important <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/highlights/what_does_nasa_do.html">mission</a>. As Dr. Abdalati notes,
our "awareness of the freedoms and responsibilities [that integrity
requires] will help us continue to pursue new knowledge, fuel wonder,
and make groundbreaking discoveries about the universe and our place in
it." It is also why we continue to <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/directory/">engage citizens</a>, pressing forward
with <a href="http://code.nasa.gov/guide/">open source policy development</a>, building an effective <a href="http://data.nasa.gov/">platform
for open data</a>, accelerating <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/technology-accelerators/">effective technologies</a>, and
strengthening the <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/">open communities</a> here across NASA.</p>
<p>It is a commitment that is often hard. <em>But it is one that is always
worthwhile.</em></p>
