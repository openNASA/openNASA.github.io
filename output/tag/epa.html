</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><em>While this agency is perhaps most known for explorations beyond Earth,
for decades, NASA has been dedicated to unraveling the mysteries of one
of the most complex objects in the universe -- planet Earth. Because of
NASA’s commitment to Earth science, we have developed an understanding
of our home planet that is unmatched in human history. But there is
still so much more to learn. Scores of NASA satellites are expanding our
knowledge and in the process helping save lives through improved
response to natural disasters, and helping us better cope with
environmental, health, and energy challenges that know no borders.</em></p>
<p><em>In recent years NASA has also taken steps to minimize our footprint on
the planet by constructing green buildings and investing in green
aviation research to inspire the development of more fuel-efficient
aircraft and spark the start of a new electric airplane industry.</em></p>
<p><em>In the spirit of stewardship exemplified by our agency, I encourage you
to participate in Earth Day educational events, programs, and activities
planned at your center or in your local community. Whether you decide to
walk to work, volunteer for a local community clean-up, or talk to
students about NASA’s Earth science or green aviation research, let us
celebrate this planet we call home on Earth Day and all year long. </em></p>
<p><strong>NASA Administrator Charles Bolden for Earth Day 2012 </strong></p>
<p>It's no accident that we are holding the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space Apps
Challenge</a> on the same weekend as <a href="http://www.epa.gov/earthday/">Earth Day</a>. NASA's vision
to reach for new heights and reveal the unknown so that what we do and
learn will benefit all humankind has as much impact for how we live on
Earth as for how we will explore beyond the Earth.</p>
<p>How can you make a difference?</p>
<ul>
<li>Have an idea for a cool app to celebrate Earth Day? The only limit
    is your creativity! Join the challenge <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/earth-day-space-data-planet/">here</a>. (You must be
    registered for the International Space Apps Challenge for your
    solution to be eligible for global judging.)</li>
<li>Get involved in <a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/">Fragile Oasis</a>, where we are connecting Space and
    Earth every day. <em>"It is very difficult to look at our beautiful
    Earth from space without being moved in some way. One of the main
    goals of Fragile Oasis is to share this orbital perspective and
    inspire people to go out and make a difference; to go out and
    somehow make life better for those with whom they share this fragile
    oasis. The Fragile Oasis community was established to unite in the
    common goal of sharing our humanity and improving our world. Let us
    inspire, recognize, and help each other in our collective quest to
    make life better on our planet."</em>You can also follow

    Apps Challenge is on every continent this week - wouldn't it be
    great if we could submit images from every continent as well?</li>

*If somebody'd said before the flight, "Are you going to get carried
away looking at the earth from the moon?" I would have say, "No, no
way." But yet when I first looked back at the earth, standing on the
moon, I cried.*

**Astronaut Alan Shepard**

*The world itself looks cleaner and so much more beautiful. Maybe we can
make it that way—the way God intended it to be—by giving everybody that
new perspective from out in space.*

**Astronaut Roger Chaffee**
