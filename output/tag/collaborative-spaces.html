</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>As NASA quickly approaches a workforce transformation, a movement has
surfaced to not only rethink <em>how</em> the agency shares what it knows,
but <em>where</em>.</p>
<p>“Knowledge at NASA doesn’t only live inside people’s heads. It’s in the
relationships between people, the space between people,” said Larry
Prusak, Editor-in-Chief of <em>ASK Magazine</em>, in <a href="https://sna.hq.nasa.gov/watch?v=yOF_Ir1YKl8">2006</a>. “The
architecture of buildings is a great symbol and signal of cooperation
and collaboration. When you go into an office and see one hundred closed
doors, no open space, no space for talking, no space for meeting, it
[sends] a big signal.”</p>
<p>The importance of face-to-face collaboration, knowledge transfer, and
innovation is the reason why pharmaceutical company Novartis began
knocking down and rebuilding nearly twenty of its buildings in 2005.
It’s why Steve Jobs installed bathrooms in the atrium at Pixar, and
why <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask/issues/41/41i_potential.html">Fuji Xerox</a> has rooms called “The Shipyard” and “The Brain.” All
these organizations recognized the importance of creating spaces that
enable people to collaborate and think creatively.</p>
<p>At NASA, the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr1722enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr1722enr.pdf">2010 Telework Enhancement Act</a>, which provides employees
and managers with flexible work arrangements, and recent travel budget
cuts are forcing the agency to rethink how people work together, which
has added momentum to efforts across the agency to create collaborative
work spaces at the centers. These efforts, along with the increasingly
collaborative nature of NASA projects and distributed teams, indicate a
growing interest in work spaces that are accessible, connected, and
flexible.</p>

<p><strong>A Burning Platform</strong></p>
<p>Since its inception, Langley Research Center’s Navigation Center has
grown from 2,500 to 10,000 square feet. It consists of different-sized
rooms outfitted with projectors, tables, screens, whiteboards, wireless
Internet, and speakers. With trained facilitators available on-site, the
space is set up to enable creativity and connectivity. "It’s an open
environment. We are known for being neutral territory," said Karen
Freidt, the team lead at the Navigation Center. “My office space
provides a variety of hotelling options [i.e., an unassigned work space]
for all. Employees can use the small desk, the treadmill desk, or the
air-hockey-combination-conference table as they please. If someone is
using a certain space, I just find another spot to work."</p>
<p>The Navigation Center’s origin story starts in 1993, when the future of
Langley’s wind tunnels was threatened. Unless the center found a way to
increase efficiency and decrease cost, the tunnels would have to be shut
down entirely. The Wind Tunnel Enterprise (WTE), a team dedicated to
reinventing how Langley managed its wind tunnels, was created. Senior
decision makers—influenced by a five-day facilitated workshop that took
place in a collaborative environment—decided to establish a
collaborative working space called the Navigation Center to enable the
WTE to find a creative solution and save the tunnels.</p>
<p>“The Navigation Center is much more than just the space. The employees,
especially those who have the expertise in facilitation, creativity and
innovation, are the heart and soul of this space.” said Freidt.</p>
<p>“When an organization wants to do a major improvement to its processes,
it frequently takes a burning platform issue to make it happen,” said
Charlie Dunton, a senior facilitator at Navigation Center. “The
Navigation Center here at Langley formed under exactly those
circumstances.” If the organization fails to meet the demand in front of
it, it will likely crumble. “I think we may be seeing the same thing
going on with collaborative spaces at NASA,” said Dunton.</p>
<p><strong>Writing on the Wall</strong></p>
<p>Last August, David Miranda, a simulation engineer and in the IT
Directorate and member of the Spaceport Innovators at Kennedy Space
Center (KSC), got the go-ahead and a bit of funding from Pat Simpkins,
KSC Director of Engineering, to find and outfit a space dedicated to
innovation at KSC. “What that meant was whiteboards everywhere. Every
surface should be a place to share your ideas, which includes the walls
and the tables. In the future, we want to find ways to connect with
other rooms through video cameras and shared digital whiteboards,” said
Miranda.</p>
<p><img alt="KSC room" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/KSC-300x199.jpg" title="KSC room" /></p>

<p>Concurrently, Skip Owens, a systems engineer at KSC, is working with
Miranda to develop a space that allows engineers to take the product
from Miranda’s room (the idea) and then produce a design. NASA is
already home to several integrated design centers, places for parallel
problem solving. (The center at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, also
called Team X, was recently featured in a Gizmodo <a href="https://sna.hq.nasa.gov/5881653/,DanaInfo=gizmodo.com+this-is-how-spaceships-are-born">story</a>.) Going to
the Moon? Get the flight design, thermal, and power engineers all in the
same space to crunch the numbers concurrently. Now, imagine if these
engineers were capable of doing this easily and effectively in virtual
space. “If you’re working on a particular design problem, you could
bring in an expert at Glenn or Goddard for a project at JPL. You
wouldn’t have to travel. You could just plug in,” said Owens. “It’d be
really nice to know that you could always go into a room and interact
with your team that is spread out across all of these centers and have
that connectivity wherever you go."</p>
<p>The ability to effectively share voice, video, and data is critical,
Owens and Miranda explained. The standard methods of collaboration are
no longer enough for today’s work. “On a telecon, I can’t see what
you’re saying. With video, we can see each other faces, but we can’t
read each other’s minds,” said Miranda. “That’s where things like shared
whiteboards come in. It’s a way for me to show you my mind.”</p>
<p><strong>Working, Learning, and Sharing Virtually Anywhere</strong></p>
<p>In 2008, an informal, roving collaborative work session called “Co-Lab”
emerged at Langley just as the Navigation Center was gathering steam. An
individual would send out an email to the group, inviting everyone to a
new location each time. They’d eat lunch together and then whip out
laptops and paperwork and pick up with business as usual. “I really
found a lot of value in Co-Lab,” said Eileen Nelson, Executive Liaison
to Langley’s Chief Strategist and Speakers Bureau Manager at Langley.
“It was a great way to meet and network with other people, brainstorm
with them, and learn what other people at Langley are doing and how it
related to me.” The roving Co-Lab meetings lasted for about a year.</p>
<p>Johnson Space Center took a different approach: a fixed physical space
with a roving workforce. Located on the second floor of Building 29, the
“sp.ace” is outfitted with mobile tables, chairs, and whiteboards to
allow users to reconfigure the room to meet their needs. It is a place
where the traditional workforce meets the increasingly transient one
through the physical space and virtual space via online collaborative
tools. “Get out of your office and co-locate to work with your
colleagues”, wrote Christopher Gerty, a member of NASA’s Open Government
Team, on the open.nasa blog. “Share ideas and help each other look at
problems differently, brainstorm solutions, or maybe even just practice
that big presentation in front of an unbiased pair of eyes.”</p>
<p>Open, light, and flat, the sp.ace is an environment where people and
ideas can connect, collide, and coalesce. “By discussing issues with
folks who don’t have your same perspective, it seems easier to be
confident in the right solution to problems faster,” said Gerty.
“Connecting also seems less deliberate and more natural. It takes full
advantage of face-to-face interaction.”</p>
<p>After visiting the sp.ace, William Eshagh, IT Research and Development
at Ames Research Center, returned home to California and started writing
a proposal for the Ames analog: the “sp.arc.” The space would be
reconfigurable like the JSC sp.ace. “Immoveable furniture is an
impediment to the creative process,” said Eshagh. “Not being able to
write on walls – we’ve been writing on walls since the Stone Age. It’s
natural!”</p>

<p><em>William Eshagh, IT Research and Development at Ames Research Center,

<p>He also proposed the space as a place to prototype new technologies.
Eshagh has been working on an initiative to enable agency-wide
collaboration through remote whiteboarding capabilities. This capability
would allow users from different locations to draw on the same virtual
whiteboard. The sp.arc would be a place for employees to test out
technologies like this and determine if they found them useful.</p>
<p>Though Eshagh's proposal has yet to find a home at Ames, another nearby
space with a similar purpose just started to gain momentum. Located at
the Ames Research Park, “Connect Lab” acts as a place for anyone to work
and learn collaboratively across disciplines and to test out new
technologies (e.g., iPads).</p>
<p>“I honestly think there’s something to these spaces. I don’t think this
is a fad,” said Eshagh. “Ames is surrounded by companies that understand
that it’s important to work in a place that fully allows you to be
creative. If we can’t attract new talent by demonstrating how
forward-leaning we are in the way we think about how we work with one
another and how we get things done, we're going to find that the bright
ones will go somewhere else.”</p>
<p><strong>Making It Happen</strong></p>
<p>A major determining factor of the success of collaborative spaces is if
they are accessible to everyone. These spaces tend to succeed if they
are equipped with the right capability (e.g., wireless Internet
capability, electrical outlets, screens, etc.), are easily accessible
(e.g., no locked doors, no unnecessary layers of security, and not far
removed), and have community buy-in.</p>
<p>“Money,” said Miranda, “isn’t a deal breaker.” For instance, he asked,
why buy additional whiteboards if you can use the frosted glass walls in
a room? “The whole room can be a canvas for your ideas,” said Miranda.
Sometimes all that’s needed is permission to utilize the space and
resources that already exist.</p>
<p>Efforts to create collaborative spaces are not confined to Langley,
Kennedy, Ames, and Johnson. The next steps involve finding ways for
center-based collaborative spaces to work with one another. “We’re
paying attention to what each other’s groups are doing,” said Dunton.
“As these spaces pop up across the agency, we need think about
connectivity.”</p>
<p>The benefits of collaboration include unexpected synergies, diversity of
thought, better products, and cross-pollination of ideas. These
benefits, while seemingly intangible, are what drive innovation and
organizational progress. Creating a space where ideas can thrive is
increasingly important in today’s project world.</p>                </article>
