industrial and interaction design student <a href="mailto:kljeremk@syr.edu">Katy Jeremko</a> to share
about the recent design charrette that Syracuse held in advance of the
<a href="http://rhok.org/space">International Space Apps Challenge</a>. This interactive <a href="http://syr.edu/news/articles/2012/space-apps-02-12.html">event</a>
offered university students an opportunity to dialogue about space data
while helping to shape the proposed challenges and applications of their
solutions. You can follow Katy on Twitter at <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/katyjeremko">@katyjeremko</a>.</em></p>
<p>When we’re children, we see magic everywhere; we like to pick things up,
shake them, ask questions, and share our opinions about them. That sense
of curiosity is what makes childhood so precious and unique to any other
time in our lives. It’s a period in which we tinker without the
restrictions and limitations of the world in which we live today,
fraught with disbelief. However, we look forward to growing up when
we’re young because we see the potential in everything, and we want the
authority to participate in it.   Coming from the perspective of someone
in the in-between of adulthood and childhood, I can safely say that
there are still opportunities for little nuggets of magic despite the
constraints of, “that won’t work” and “don’t do that”.</p>
<p><strong>NASA’s Space Apps Challenges are important because they ignite this
sense of wonder and creativity that has been stifled under the surface
of society.</strong> This is the first time in a long time that there is a
space being cultivated for a larger philanthropic purpose, stringing
together the beginnings of ideas which will shape our future world.
Everyday we hear about new projects or initiatives going on in the
world, but there’s no concrete platform bridging them together. NASA is
sharing its thoughts and ideas with the world, which is novel to the
standard business model. Learning about the things themselves is shaping
NASA’s reputation. By taking the role as the facilitator of these
challenges, NASA is going to become the resource we all go to for
bringing ideas to life. These challenges hit on all aspects of
education, visualization, technology, livelihood, and beyond. The world
is shifting towards collaboration, as well as things which are not
removed from the understanding of any one person. It’s all about asking
questions, not knowing, and finding great people who will fill in those
gaps. <strong>It’s giving way to a new, participatory and reflective culture,
erected by the likes of our greatest childhood dreams.</strong></p>
<p>This past weekend, Syracuse University students were invited to
participate in a dialogue concerning NASA’s International Space Apps
Challenge. We took the opportunity to hold a Design Charrette, or
collaborative design thinking session, to gather students from different
practices together to have a discussion on the topics presented. I come
from the background of studying Industrial and Interaction Design, which
is founded on principles of considering systems - how they work, how
they change, and how we react to them. Unlike any other major that I
know of, we are encouraged to pursue a greater understanding of the
relationships between people and things and are not afraid to
collaborate and ideate. <strong>We don’t sit in a lecture hall, we don’t raise
our hands to speak, and we don’t let any idea go untouched. This model
is something that I believe NASA is starting to pursue at a greater
capacity than ever before.</strong> It is the model which is taking the world
by storm, as we’re seeing this through Cloud Computing, Open-Source
frameworks, and social transparency on the web. With a greater number of
pathways for communication, it’s hard to believe that nothing’s
possible.</p>
<p>I’m in the generation where I’m going to be figuring out what role I
play in the shifting world. Students like me will look to NASA as a
resource and facilitator for ideas and concepts, as NASA’s name will
become ubiquitous with “making it happen”. More than anything, by
prompting conversation, NASA is preparing the world for what’s to come
as we continue to develop. We may not see it now, but <strong>we should expect
a new world of innovation, leveraged by the thoughts and participation
of its citizens.</strong></p>
