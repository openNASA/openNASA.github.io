</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>We need to thank the <strong>hundreds</strong> of people who took the time to create
a Zooniverse account (or use their existing one) to help classify
features on the reef.  It's been just over a week that the
<a href="https://neemo.zooniverse.org/">NEEMO-Zooniverse platform</a> (designed by <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a>) has been in
active beta testing, and we are really excited in the results so far!
 We see participation from people like you as our means of exploring
further in the future!</p>

<p>I also wanted to give an update on both the mission and the
classification tasks.  As you may have heard, <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1977">Hurricane Rina</a> was
threatening the Florida Keys last week, before it was broken apart by a
significant weather system from the north.  During that time, the crew
of Aquarius had just settled in and "saturated" with Nitrogen - meaning
they require an oxygen prebreathe protocol before returning to a sea
level pressure.  Since it takes time to prepare for this oxygen
protocol, and hurricane preparations take even more time after that, it
was decided to cut the mission down from 13 days to only seven.  The
crewed portion of NEEMO-15 <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=290686337617457">ended last Thursday</a>, but the citizen
science continued on!</p>
<p>In just over a week, over 300 citizen scientists discovered over 12,000
features, and confirmed (or disputed) each others observations over
22,000 times. Crowdsourcing techniques such as these are being
considered in the overall exploration approach, as NASA plans missions
to distant worlds, including asteroids.  NEEMO-15's prime focus was to
practice tools and techniques needed to explore an asteroid, so this was
the perfect venue for this experiment!  During our own beta testing, I
couldn't help imagining looking at pictures of an asteroid and planning
a human mission to one, as I examined an endangered coral reef for signs
of delicate life.</p>

classifications, overlaid on Google Earth image of the ocean."][![Small
colored circles associated with classifications, in diagonal
rows.][]][][/caption]</p>
<p>The most significant findings in my opinion (probably since I'm not a
marine biologist) were the improvements on our exploration technique. 
Almost immediately, the emerging community of virtual aquanauts began
bringing ideas forward to better the interface, improve data flow, and
even take better images of the reef.  Our extremely responsive team at
Vizzuality incorporated many of the suggestions on the spot, while
others are planned for future instances.</p>
<p>While the community around NEEMO-Zooniverse was building, we began
showing the resultant data to the traverse planners and NASA engineers. 
Their response was equally as positive and constructive, with the
engineers/geologists who took the images having a great exchange on
photography techniques, and how to resolve exact locations under the
ocean.  Exchanging many of the location-based data sets in Google
Earth-compatible .kml files made visualization easy and straightforward
on multiple platforms.  Since many of the components used in this
project were developed under an open source license, future versions of
this tool will benefit from the contributions of a vibrant developer
community as well.  All in all we're extremely pleased with the project
as a whole, and are beginning to discuss the next steps in earnest.</p>
<p>To our community of "virtual aquanauts":  <strong>Thanks so much for exploring
with us!</strong>  Your work here is shaping the path of our future!  Stay
tuned as we wrap up the project in the coming days.  We'll continue to
leave the site active and take your classifications, comments and
feedback, and we'll report back soon with another update here at
