say there are enough apps to perform virtually any task you have in
mind! I find apps to be a great tool to keep me in touch with friends,
daily news, and NASA.</p>
<p>The flagship app for NASA is of course the "<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/index.html">NASA App</a>", which is
available on both iOS and Android platforms, and has been downloaded
over 9.9 million times and recently averaged over 2.5 million hits per
day.  However, NASA has made a wide variety of interactive apps for
mobile users, which range from performing a spacewalk to receiving a
notification every time the ISS is right above you. These apps give you
an opportunity to stay involved and educated on current and future NASA
missions.  Listed below are all 41 of the NASA-related apps for iOS and
Android!</p>
<p>Click away and download as many as you can.</p>

</a>By: Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br />
The app was designed to give an overview of the spacecraft’s current
activities, starting with the latest dramatic images. These images range
from sublime insights into another ‘set of worlds,’ considering the moon
Titan itself has been called the most earth-like body in our solar
system. Also included in the app is the ‘Present Position’ of the
spacecraft, as well as a countdown to the next major event – usually a
spectacular targeted flyby of one of Saturn’s moons. More in-depth
information is only a click away.</p>
<p>​6. [Comet Quest<br />

the Moon’s interior from the surface to the deep interior, advance our
understanding of the thermal evolution of the Moon and our understanding
of how other rocky planets in the solar system are formed. The voyage to
the moon will take approximately 5 months at which point the two
spacecraft will enter precision formation orbit ranging from 50km to
200km above the moons surface. Later versions of the app will include
images captured by MoonKAM.</p>

Solar system, Earth, Aeronautics, Astronauts.</p>
<p><strong>Now *this* is living in the 21st Century!</strong></p>
<p>It’s amazing to see all the apps that are related to NASA and space, all
compressed into one list. As a space lover, I like the apps that feature
neat pictures from space or interactive simulations, which tends to be a
theme for most of them.</p>
<p>From the list above we can say that (so far) 74% of the apps are iOS and
26% are Android. Although Android continues to grow iOS stands firm and
dominates the NASA application list! Find the apps that most interest
you, and spark your interest in science and space through them! They're
only a <em>touch</em> away.</p>
<p><strong>This list is definitely not complete - we need your help to make it
even more accurate. Do you know of any other apps that should be on this
list?  What kind of apps would you like to see?  Let us know in the
comments below or email us at opengov@nasa.gov.</strong></p>
