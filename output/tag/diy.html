</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>There is a growing movement around the world based off an old, very
simple, idea. The idea is that you can do it yourself, whatever "it" may
be. This has existed as part of the Do-It-Yourself, or DIY, ideal for a
very long time with crafters, artisans, and weekend warriors of all
types. As we continue our footsteps into the early part of the 21st
century that ideal is evolving into the Maker movement. Last week, NASA
was nominated for a prestigious award within the Maker movement, a <a href="http://makezine.com/makeys/">MAKE
Magazine Industry Maker Award</a>, known as a Makey.</p>
<p>The award is given by MAKE Magazine to individuals and groups that show
"outstanding support for independent Maker/Hacker culture". The nominee
announcement process began at the Bay Area Maker Faire this past May and
the winners will be announced at the <a href="http://makerfaire.com/newyork/2012/index.html">World Maker Faire</a> in New York
at the end of this month.</p>
<p>NASA is, of course, incredibly honored to be nominated by the public for
a Makey and then to be selected out of the pool of nominees for the
final sixteen slots. Outreach to the public and bringing the work that
NASA does in aeronautics and space exploration to open minds is an
important part of what we do as an Agency. The kind words and accolades
in the announcement speak for themselves but the real honor, to this
NASA engineer, is the <a href="http://blog.makezine.com/2012/08/30/makey-awards-2012-nominee-09-nasa-education/">final nomination statement</a> in the
announcement:</p>
<p><strong>For lifting so many young eyes upward, toward the stars, and for doing
so much to keep them there, we are proud to welcome NASA to the running
for the 2012 Makey Awards.</strong></p>
<p>Thank you to all of the NASA supporters and enthusiasts around the world
and to the Makey team for nominating NASA for this prestigious award in
an arena filled with amazing companies, organizations, and individuals
trying to Make the world a better place.</p>                </article>
