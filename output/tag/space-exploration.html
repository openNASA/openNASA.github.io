</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p><em>We need your help!</em> There are a number of exciting space related panels
proposed for next year’s <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">South by Southwest</a> festival in Austin. SXSW
is a community-driven event and voting accounts for 30% of the
decision-making process for any given programming slot. The selection
process is extremely competitive and this year there are 3600 proposed
panels, of which only 500 get selected. The more votes we submit for the
space panels, the more likely a panel related to space exploration will
be included in the final SxSW program. Voting ends on Friday, September
2 (11:59 PM CST), so please vote <em>today</em>!</p>
<p>To help you out, we’ve put together a directory for all the space
related panels. This includes panels that have NASA representation as
well others that may not necessarily be NASA affiliated.</p>

<p>Want to change the world? Then get a license to RHoK! Random Hacks of
Kindness (RHoK) is a global initiative to create practical open source
solutions to humanity's toughest challenges. Organized by Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo!, HP, NASA and the World Bank, RhoK brings together
thousands of the best and brightest developers from around the world -
like YOU - to participate in fast–paced and competitive marathon coding
events resulting in real applications that are making an impact on
humanity. The RHoK community has grown rapidly over the past 2 years,
with 3000 participants from 43 cities who have worked on 214 distinct
solutions. This talk will bring together "RHoKstars" to provide an
overview of the initiative, discuss some of the solutions developed,
describe how the SxSW community can contribute to the effort and most
importantly, brainstorm about what is next. …and if they let us, we'll
be playing rock music and lighting off fireworks!</p>

<p>Want to make some money? Federal agencies have recently been given the
authority by Congress to sponsor competitions for individuals, groups,
and companies to develop new ideas and technology innovations for a
chance to win potentially lucrative prizes. These competitions can range
from new mobile outreach technologies to web-based data analytics tools
to even vehicle-to-vehicle communications; the government is looking for
breakthrough technologies from the minds of the most innovative and
forward thinking Americans, many of whom are at SXSW. This session will
highlight some of the coolest prizes for technology development that the
government has been involved in to date, including the DOT’s Connected
Vehicle Challenge, the VA’s Open Source and blue button projects, and
NASA’s centennial challenges. Additionally you will learn about some
prizes government did NOT play a role in to explore what role the
government should be playing in these activities moving forward.</p>

<p>The nation's space agency and the world's largest museum and research
complex have embraced the use of social media to reach out, engage new
audiences, engage existing audiences in new ways, and give the public
behind-the-scenes access. This conversation with NASA and the
Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum will explore successes and failures
in these new ways of engaging and solicit your input for new
opportunities they have yet to try.</p>

<p>Niburu! Comet Elenin! Asteroid YU55! It's not the end of the world,
really. NASA and Discover's "Bad Astronomer" Phil Plait are here to
explain why. This panel discussion will take on the Internet factor in
the cause and cure of 2012 hysteria. We'll look at how urban legends
spread, data gets shared and myths get debunked online. See the
Web-based tools the Near-Earth Objects office at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory uses to keep an eye on asteroids and comets (and let you know
about them), and how the amateur astronomy community is helping in the
effort to track low-flying space rocks. The Bad Astronomer himself
shares rumor-slaying tales from behind the scenes of his popular blog.

<p>Slightly over a year ago we had this idea of trying to launch a ballon
into the stratosphere (\~100,000 feet) with a couple of cameras and get
it back down safely. Since then we've launched 6 balloons and
successfully recovered all of them. We learned a lot in the process: how
inert gases cannot explode but can instead make other things explode,
how to calculate volumes and weights appropriately to attain the desired
height before the descent, how dropping the payload in salted water can
be harmful for the cameras, how to put more and more sensors in the
payload and still have it lift off, and how ideas that sometimes seem
brilliant may cover hidden dangers (and extremely ridiculous moments).
We have also managed to gather dozens and dozens of people around this
movement, up to the point of having 12 cars with 5 people each and lots
of gear running after 3 balloons simultaneously. And did we tell you
running away from wild animals? Apart from telling (and showing) you all
these things, we will also unveil our ideas for the future and answer
your questions if you're planning to launch a HAB.</p>

<li>What are the hazards and challenges for sending equipment to space?</li>

<p>The relationship most adults have with science is one of observation:
watching government agencies explore on behalf of us, but not actually
exploring it ourselves. Science should be disruptively accessible –
empowering people from a variety of different backgrounds to explore,
participate in, and build new ways of interacting with and contributing
to science. By having a fresh set of eyes from those who solve different
types of problems, new concepts often emerge and go on to influence
science in unexpected ways. A grassroots effort called Science Hack Day
aims to bridge the gap between the science, technology and design
industries. A Hack Day is a 48 hour all-night event that brings
different people with good ideas together in the same physical space for
a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking, and building ‘cool
stuff’. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period,
small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable results.</p>
<p><em>Questions Answered:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How is hacking actually contributing to science?</li>
<li>"I'm not a developer, what can I do?"</li>
<li>What types of things can I make with science?</li>
<li>Can scientists and non-scientists really collaborate?</li>
<li>How can I create a Science Hack Day in my city?</li>

<p>When NASA's budget was drastically cut and the commercial aerospace
industry found itself in charge of getting man into space, a group of
"space geeks" consisting of web developers, aerospace scientists and
engineers, and people who have a dream of living in space started
meeting up and designed the rules, developed the application, and are
sharing Space Points and are increasing awareness publicly about space
policy, increasing funding to aerospace-related research (commercial and
government), and having fun playing to win!</p>
