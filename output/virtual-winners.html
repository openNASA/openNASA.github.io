from all corners of the world participated online to tackle the 58
challenges. 170 solutions were submitted and today we are announcing the
top 4 virtual winners! These teams will progress to the global judging
round and will also receive two K’NEX Building Sets which were provided

We look forward to reviewing all solutions nominated for global judging.
As a reminder to all those who were nominated, here’s what you need to

    your project page.
2.  Prepare a 2:00 minute video giving an overview of your project.
    (including demo if possible) and add it to your project page.
3.  Be sure that your project page is as complete as possible with
    resources, all team members, all code.

Congratulations to everyone!
