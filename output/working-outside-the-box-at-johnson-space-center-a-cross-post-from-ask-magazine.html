Government Team in Houston for a co-working week.  In only a few days,
we accomplished a lot: discussed the future of our space agency, infused
different lines of thinking into a variety of projects we were
individually assigned, screened content for the upcoming <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsummit/index.html">NASA IT
Summit</a> and collaborated on one project of international scale - all
while still attending those (mostly virtual) mandatory meetings we all
have every week.  One of the talents who joined us that week was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nasa_appel">Haley
Stephenson of the APPEL Ask the Academy team</a>, who used the
opportunity to focus on the collaborative space that we met in, and
reflect on how it affects our work.  Below is <strong>her</strong> work, available
via <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/ata_4-5_7_20.html">ASK the Academy</a>, published July 20, 2011:</em></p>

<h2><strong>Working Outside the Box at Johnson Space Center</strong></h2>
<p>What impact does a room really have on your work?</p>

Center"][<img alt="Whiteboard tables and chairs in front of a wall-mounted

<p>Ask someone where to find “the sp.ace” at Johnson Space Center (JSC) and
they might look at you as though you’ve queried the location of Platform
9 ¾ or a wardrobe leading to Narnia. Between Buildings 34 and 585 at JSC
sits Building 29. It once housed the Apollo astronaut centrifuge, and
later the Weightless Environment Training Facility (WETF)—a precursor to
the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory—which trained astronauts for Hubble
repair missions. Today Building 29 supports another mission:
collaboration.</p>
<p>Inside one of the high bays overlooking the former home of the WETF is a
work area available to everyone at the center. The decor is simple and
functional: whiteboard tables, colorful rolling chairs, mobile desks and
whiteboard walls. Have an idea? Write it on the table or a wall. Share
it on a screen. Need a bit of privacy? Go to the neighboring room (“the
fishbowl”) and work there.</p>
<p>Open, light, and flat, the sp.ace is an environment where people and
ideas can connect, collide, and coalesce. It is a place where the
traditional workforce meets the increasingly transient one. As project
teams become more geographically dispersed and the demand for
cross-disciplinary innovation continues to grow, some organizations are
creating work environments that foster disruptive ideas and unexpected
solutions.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #800000">Beyond Cubism</span></em></strong><br />
Collaborative spaces are not new. Early coffeehouses from the 1600’s
were hotbeds of social interaction and collaboration. Walk into any
on-campus college café and you’ll see writing on the walls and hear
lively conversation. While the fundamentals of human collaboration have
not changed since the Enlightenment, the amount of information and
knowledge available through technological advances has. The challenge
facing organizations is to standardize the technology used to
collaborate and connect, not the location of the worker.</p>
<p>Until the mid-1960s, typical office spaces consisted of open areas lined
with orderly rows of desks. Paperwork was filed in cabinets or neatly
piled in stacks on desktops. As the amount of information passing
through organizations increased, something had to give.</p>
<p>In 1968, Robert Propst invented the cubicle, which drastically altered
the office work environment. While the original intention of the cubicle
was to liberate workers from piles of paperwork and give them the
opportunity to spread out, visualize information differently, and
establish a sense of identity at the office, Propst’s invention took
another path. Now a symbol of compartmentalization, the workplace is
undergoing a shift away from "cube farms" toward more collaborative
working spaces.</p>

<p>Organizations like SpaceX have open, flat work environments designed to
reflect their flat organizational structure. Fuji Xerox has rooms in
Europe and Japan that are designed to elicit certain types of thinking –
a sort of “cognitive ergonomics,” a term used by researchers at large
office furniture companies like Steelcase and Herman Miller. Companies
from Google to Capital One have made open, transparent, collaborative
work spaces available to their employees.</p>
<p>Work real estate is at a premium. Projects are increasingly interagency
and international. Employees don’t always utilize an office—they’re
getting the job done elsewhere. IBM, for example, has done away with
office space for tens of thousands of its employees. Practices such as
“hotelling,” where employees are given unassigned spaces in a work
environment, are being used to meet the needs of nomadic workers. This
way of working is making its way to government.</p>
<p>In December 2010, President Obama signed the Telework Enhancement Act
“to improve teleworking in executive agencies by developing a telework
program that allows employees to telework at least 20 percent of the
hours worked in every two administrative work weeks, and for other
purposes.” This June, executive agencies passed the first milestone of
informing employees who meet the teleworking criteria that they are
eligible for a new way to work. The next steps include acquiring
technologies to allow for incorporation of telework into agency
operations and policies in order to decrease real-estate costs.
Collaborative workspaces allow organizations to optimize the use of
their work real estate, and workspace is no longer defined by one
function or set of walls. It becomes adaptable, flexible; anything the
organization wants it or needs it to be.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #800000"><em>The Sp.ace, the Sandbox, and Fab
Labs</em></span></strong><br />
NASA is accustomed to collaboration on many levels. Collaborative
spaces exist at Ames Research Center and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
connected by hyperwalls—large multi-screen displays—to collaborate on
projects such as high-resolution image analysis from Mars. The pixel
resolution allows for scientists separated by nearly 400 miles to
collaborate and plan out a rover’s path. The JSC sp.ace is a modest
beginning to something that hopes to grow. It's a place for people to
congregate and spur imagination, creativity, and curiosity. But it’s
only a start.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_4341" align="alignright" width="300"
caption="The "Sandbox" at Johnson Space Center"][<img alt="A warehouse with
table for collaborating in the foreground" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/572438main_4-5_working_outside_box_jsc_3_full-300x224.jpg" />][][/caption]</p>
<p>Plans for another collaborative working space at JSC are afoot. The
“Sandbox” will draw on the global success of the MIT Fabrication
Laboratories (“Fab Labs”) which started gaining recognition in 2002. Fab
Labs were founded on the premise of giving people tools to create things
rather than consume them. The Sandbox, used to be warehouse that held
old boxes of this and that and then acquired a variety of electronics,
welding, and machining equipment in addition to an open meeting area. It
is the hardware/prototyping equivalent of the sp.ace in Building 29 and
will be virtually connected to other collaborative working spaces. As
this new space evolves, a sort of collaborative space “cookbook” with
information about standardizing connections (e.g., HDMI inputs),
bandwidth requirements, audio and video connections and positioning, and
power needs (e.g., easily accessible power strips) will be made
available for others to create other collaborative spaces capable of
connecting with established ones.</p>
<p>While the creation of collaborative spaces at JSC is continuing to
evolve, the JSC “sp.ace” has already had success with a designated
coworking week. Anyone from flight controllers, to administrative
assistants, to project teams utilized the space to meet their needs or
simply check it out. Throughout the week, as new faces trickled in and
familiar ones returned for another visit, it was apparent that an
entirely different wave of information and knowledge sharing driven by
increased technological capability is upon us. Traditional offices
aren’t supporting workforces like they have in the past, and
organizations are starting to adapt.</p>
