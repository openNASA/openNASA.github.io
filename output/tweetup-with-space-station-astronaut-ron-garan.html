<p>Garan spent 164 days in space during the Expedition 27 and Expedition 28
missions to the International Space Station. He and his crewmates
launched April 4, 2011, and returned to Earth on Sept. 15, 2011. While
aboard the station, the crew continued work on a variety of microgravity
experiments and received provisions from two shuttle missions, including
the last space shuttle visit to the station. Garan participated in the
last space-shuttle-based spacewalk during the STS-135 mission.</p>
<p>During his time in space, Garan shared his experiences and images he
took of Earth from the space station via his Twitter account,
@Astro_Ron, and blog.</p>
