</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>NASA has a clear mandate for the "widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results"
â€“ and the <a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp">NASA Technical Reports Server</a> is just one example of how
the Agency is leading the way in transparency and open data. Constant,
worldwide access to historic data and documentation in a single, simple
interface demonstrates NASA's commitment to not only make the material
available but make it easily locatable and useful.</p>
<p>The NASA Technical Reports Server provides the public access to NASA's
current and historical technical literature and engineering results. It
includes the NACA collection, the NASA collection, and the NASA Image
eXchange. Over 500,000 aerospace-related citations, over 200,000
full-text online documents, and over 500,000 images and videos are
available through a common interface. The search tool permits refinement
by category or through the use of a concept cloud. All information found
in the NTRS was created or funded by NASA, and it is unlimited,
unclassified, and publicly available.</p>
<p>NTRS logged 3.7 million visits last year and is truly a 24/7 and
worldwide. Taking a look at access patterns over a typical week in 2010,
one can see that there is no significant fall off in use in terms of
both day of the week and time of day. Over a quarter of the traffic to
NTRS comes from foreign internet domains, the top five being: United
Kingdom, Australia, Germany, China, and Japan. There is no surprise that
Google registers as the top referrer to NTRS at 14% after direct
traffic. This percentage share rises to 31% after adding in the rest of
Google's international presence. NTRS is also a source to Science.gov
and Worldwidescience.org. NTRS has a very strong brand name as shown by
top search phases in referring search engines being comprised of "NTRS,"
"NASA Technical Report Server," and derivations thereof.</p>
<p>NTRS promotes the dissemination of NASA STI to the widest audience
possible by allowing its information to be harvested by sites using the
Open Archives Initiative Protocol for <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)</a>.
OAI-PMH defines a mechanism for information technology systems to
exchange citation information using the open standards HTTP (Hypertext
Transport Protocol) and XML (Extensible Markup Language).</p>
<p>Ever wondered how interesting the history of the space program is? Here
are a few examples of just a few of the treasures found in the NASA
Technical Reports Server:</p>

<p>This document is a conference paper entitled, "Suggestions for
Popularizing Civilian Aviation," written by "Britain's Lady Lindy," Lady
Heath, Sophie Mary Eliott-Lynn, Among these suggestions, is the idea
that "in all-metal aircraft smoking is permissible, which is an
important item of comfort on long journeys" (p. 12).</p>

<p>The Saturn V handbook was created to provide the astronaut with a single
source reference guide for the characteristics and functions of the
launch vehicle and is a fascinating reflection of historic NASA work. It
also inspired public conversation on Twitter by users who were quite
enthusiastic to page through the details for the building, resourcing,
usage, and maintenance of the rocket.</p>

selected wind tunnel results at high subsonic speeds for wing-tip
mounted winglets</strong> (NASA-TN-D-8260)

<p>Early NASA research of winglets by Collier Trophy-winner, Richard T.
Whitcomb, served as a foundation for commercialized winglets familiar to
today's frequent flyers. Winglets have been attributed with saving over
two billion gallons of jet fuel over the years.

<p>From the abstract of this paper analyzing future utilization of space
resources: "Over the last four years, the ISRU project has taken what
was essentially an academic topic with lots of experimentation but
little engineering and produced near-full-scale systems that have been
demonstrated. In 2008 &amp; again in early 2010, systems that could produce
oxygen from lunar soils (or their terrestrial analogs) were tested at a
lunar analog site on a volcano in Hawaii."</p>
