</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>At <a class="reference external" href="http://www.rhok.org/blog/peace-corps-innovation-challenge-featured-problems">RHoK</a> in December 2012, we introduced &quot;<em>featured problem sets</em>&quot;
in an effort to create stronger and more refined challenges. The first
featured problem set was offered by the Peace Corps as part of it's
&quot;<em>Innovation Challenge</em>.&quot; The Peace Corps Innovation Challenge is a
worldwide collaboration to develop innovative solutions for the real
challenges faced by people throughout the developing world as identified
and articulated by Peace Corps Volunteers. Today they announced that
they will be doing a second Innovation Challenge and are seeking
submissions of relevant problems through their <a class="reference external" href="http://innovationchallenge.peacecorps.gov/">website</a>. The submitted
problems statements will then be reviewed and voted on by current and
returned volunteers, Peace Corps staff, technology experts and
entrepreneurs. The best problems will be offered at a hackathon in June
2013. Below is their press release, which describes one of the top
solutions from the first Innovation Challenge - a Mobile Language
Application developed by Zambian software developers that translates
English words and phrases into one of seven languages spoken in Zambia.
The app, Bantu Babel, is now available for Android compatible devices in
the Google Play store. &nbsp;The NASA Open Innovation Program team worked
closely with the Peace Corps on their first Innovation Challenge and
continue to exchange best practices around effective mass collaborations
like this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON, D.C., April 1, 2013 – Peace Corps volunteers, working
closely with Zambian software developers, have developed a mobile
application that will translate English words and phrases into one
of seven languages spoken in Zambia. Bantu Babel is now available
for Android compatible devices in the Google Play store.</p>
<p>The app is intended to help Peace Corps volunteers, international
aid workers, and host country nationals communicate more
effectively. The app has two parts: a dictionary for translating
individual words, and a survival phrasebook which contains helpful
terms for accommodation, shopping, food and emergencies, among
others. Bantu Babel, which can be used as a training tool for
government and aid workers or as a supplement to formal language
training, runs offline eliminating the need for an internet
connection.</p>
<p>“<em>Peace Corps has a phenomenal language training program and to be
able to share it is both exciting and inspiring, and to be able
realize a solution in collaboration with host country nationals
truly embodies the spirit of Peace Corps</em>,” said Tony Tseng, a third
year volunteer from Sacramento, California.</p>
<p>Peace Corps volunteers Tony Tseng, Melissa Stetler, and Rasa Kent
worked with developers from BongoHive, a Lusaka-based technology and
innovation hub to develop the app. BongoHive provides a place for
the local tech community to meet, swap experience, and attend
training, networking and hackathon events.</p>
<p>“<em>It is my belief that Zambia, like many other developing
countries, is in a great position to leapfrog over traditional
technology infrastructures. Almost all Zambians own a cell phone and
the market for mobile applications is growing. To be able to utilize
the mobile phones already in use is a new approach to development
that has proven to be successful in other countries across Africa</em>,”
said Tseng.</p>
<p>The framework for the program was developed during a two-day
“hackathon” in December 2012 in Lusaka, part of the Random Hacks of
Kindness (RHoK) global hackathon that included participants in 32
cities and 16 different countries. RHoK’s mission is to create a
self-sustaining global community of innovators building practical
open technology for a better world, and to ensure their work creates
impact in society.</p>
<p>The Peace Corps participated in this worldwide event by collecting
ideas for problems and solutions through the Peace Corps Innovation
Challenge. Peace Corps is again seeking submissions of relevant
problems through the Innovation Challenge website. Problems will be
reviewed and voted on by current and returned volunteers, Peace
Corps staff, technology experts and entrepreneurs. Once problems are
reviewed and refined, technology experts will team up to develop
solutions during the next hackathon in June.</p>
<p><em>About Peace Corps/Zambia: Nearly 1,435 Peace Corps volunteers have
served in Zambia since the program was established in 1993.
Currently, 284 volunteers serve in Zambia. Volunteers work in the
areas of education, community development, environment, agriculture,
health and business. Volunteers are trained and work in the
following languages: Bemba, Kaonde, Lunda, Mambwe, Nyanja, Tonga and
Tumbuka.</em></p>
<p><em>About the Peace Corps: Since President John F. Kennedy established
the Peace Corps by executive order on March 1, 1961, more than
210,000 Americans have served in 139 host countries. Today, 8,073
volunteers are working with local communities in 76 host countries
in agriculture, community economic development, education,
environment, health and youth in development. Peace Corps volunteers
must be U.S. citizens and at least 18 years of age. Peace Corps
service is a 27-month commitment and the agency’s mission is to
promote world peace and friendship and a better understanding
between Americans and people of other countries. Visit
