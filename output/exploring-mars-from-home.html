<p>Under President Obama’s Open Government Initiative, NASA is exploring
new ways to share with the public the exciting science we take part in
every day. NASA has a long history of sharing its discoveries with the
public, but figuring out how to present it in a way that is both easy to
understand and simple to use frequently poses a challenge. By partnering
with private industry, NASA has the opportunity to take advantage of
existing technology innovations that can deliver science data in a
format that is more publically consumable.</p>
<p>Yesterday, NASA and Microsoft unveiled the latest version of WorldWide
Telescope, featuring the highest resolution and most complete map of
Mars images ever released. Over 13,000 images from NASA’s HiRISE camera
on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, each with a resolution of about 100
times that of a 10 megapixel point-and-shoot camera, have been mapped
onto a 3D globe of the Martian surface. They offer unparalleled views of
spectacular surface features, including imagery of the Mars Phoenix
Lander site and Olympus Mons – the highest peak in our solar system.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://blogs.nasa.gov/cm/resource/1013251" /><em>Soaring above Mars in WorldWide Telescope</em></p>
<p>Bringing all of these incredible images to user’s desktop computers is
not an easy feat. With hundreds of terabytes of data available, the
images must be made available “on demand” as users fly across the
Martian surface, only loading terrain data when necessary. To accomplish
this, the intelligent robotics group at Ames Research Center turned to
NASA’s <a href="http://nebula.nasa.gov/">Nebula</a> cloud computing platform. Nebula provides flexible and
efficient science-class compute and storage services that easily scale
to meet the needs of NASA scientists and researchers. Nebula was one of
three Flagship Initiatives in NASA’s Open Government Plan and is one of
the primary tools that is enabling NASA to more easily collaborate with
private industry, academia and engage with the public in ways never
before possible.</p>

<p>Nebula turned the 13,000 images from HiRISE into half a billion smaller
images that can be served in real-time to a broadband connection.
Creating this huge mosaic took two weeks of number crunching on 114 of
Nebula’s central processing units. The project demonstrated the powerful
capabilities of Nebula, which has been utilized in situations as diverse
as hosting federal spending data on USAspending.gov to providing a
mechanism for amateur astronomers across the globe to upload their
images of the LCROSS impact on the lunar south pole.</p>
<p>Technology innovations like Nebula are integral in NASA’s efforts to
partner with industry to create products and services that make NASA’s
data more easily consumable to public audiences. As we move forward in
creating an environment of even greater transparency and participation
at NASA, we hope to deliver even more engaging experiences that provide
the American public with better insight into the cosmos, planet earth,
and the work going on at NASA.</p>
