<p><strong>What do you think? How would these ideas change NASA? How would these
ideas change the federal government?</strong></p>
<p>The Obama Administration also just released a Status Report on their
Commitment to Open Government, showing progress, addressing critiques
and anticipating the next steps in opening the government.</p>

<p><strong>Some highlights from the Status Report:</strong></p>
<p><em>There is no “Open” button that can be pushed to render the federal
government more open overnight. Creating a more open government instead
requires, as the President has instructed, sustained commitment—by
public officials and employees at all levels of government. </em></p>
<p>Open government is a long-term thing. Our singular goal is to infuse
transparency, collaboration, and participation into every part of
government. It will require every person, every organization, every
agency. Some carry a misperception that OpenGov is a report we've
submitted or a group we've designated for a particular task.</p>
<p><em>Open governmentis a means, not an end. As President Obama has made
clear, greater openness “will strengthen our democracy and promote
efficiency and effectiveness in Government.” These twin goals—a stronger
democracy, a more effective government—have motivated the
Administration’s efforts in this area.</em></p>
<p>We aren’t doing this to check another box, or because someone else
thinks it's a good idea. We're doing this because it's a means to do our
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/about/whats_next.html">mission</a> (and the whole country's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution">mission</a>, actually) better and
more effectively.</p>
<p><em>Where citizens can observe the workings of government, they become more
invested in what government does. Government openness empowers citizens
as well, as they are more able to express their views about policy
decisions that affect them. Openness makes democracy stronger also by
encouraging government officials to perform better, for where government
is more open, they are more likely to be held accountable for their
decisions, both good and bad. Similarly, a more open government makes it
easier for the media and watchdog groups to expose, and therefore deter,
improper or otherwise undesirable influences on policymakers. In short,
openness enhances democracy by giving citizens a greater voice in what
government does, and promoting government action that advances the
interests of all, not just a privileged few.</em></p>
<p>This is exactly why I am committed to OpenGov at NASA: these principles
encourage us to be our best, hold us accountable for what we do, and
give all citizens another pathway into the real work of the government.
These principles create a NASA that is the best for every American
citizen.</p>
<p>I'm so proud to be a part of this - and I hope you are too.</p>
