</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><strong>Here's your opportunity to contribute to the future direction of
NASA's plans, programs and priorities, in a study directed by Congress
and led by the National Academies. This is your space program and your
future. What do you have to say about it? </strong></p>
<p>In the FY2012 appropriations bill that funds NASA, Congress requested an
independent study of NASA's strategic direction. The study is being
conducted by a committee of the <a href="http://nationalacademies.org/nrc/index.html">National Research Council</a>.</p>
<p>The study <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/ASEB/DEPS_067029">statement of task</a> directs the committee to "recommend how
NASA could establish and effectively communicate a common, unifying
vision for NASA's strategic direction that encompasses NASA's varied
missions." Strategic direction can be thought of as the steps NASA needs
to take over time to accomplish its vision and mission.</p>
<p>NASA's Strategic Direction Committee is reviewing a large amount of
published material, including the law that created NASA (the National
Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, most recently amended in 2010) and
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocfo/budget/strat_plans.html">NASA's 2011 Strategic Plan</a>, which begins with NASA's statement of
its vision and mission.</p>
<p>The current NASA vision is "to reach for new heights and reveal the
unknown, so that what we do and learn will benefit all humankind", and
its mission is to "drive advances in science, technology, and
exploration to enhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic
vitality, and stewardship of Earth." The NASA Strategic Plan also states
that NASA's current direction lays "the groundwork for a sustainable
program of exploration and innovation. This new direction extends the
life of the International Space Station, supports the growing commercial
space industry, and addresses important scientific challenges while
continuing our commitment to robust human space exploration, science,
and aeronautics programs."</p>
<p>The Strategic Directions Committee is listening to a wide variety of
experts in aeronautics and space science and technology, space policy
and programs, and communications strategy, and it wants to hear from
other stakeholders, including the public, as well.</p>
<p>The committee invites your responses to the nine questions listed
<a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/PublicInputForm/index.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>This website will be available for comments <em>only through August 17,
2012</em>. The response to each question is limited to 300 words so that the
committee can efficiently collate and analyze your responses. To gauge
how much you can write, this introduction totals 342 words. The
responses each person submits, along with the author’s name and
institution will be available for viewing at the <a href="http://sites.nationalacademies.org/DEPS/ASEB/DEPS_067029?ssSourceSiteId=SSB">NASA’s Strategic
Direction Committee website</a>.</p>
