</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Each year, NASA celebrates one invention out of the many “spinoff”
technologies that the agency inspires as the NASA Commercial Innovation
of the Year.&nbsp; This past spring, the prestigious title was bestowed on a
solar refrigeration solution designed to support life on the moon, but
has huge application here on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp; With approximately 2 billion of
Earth’s inhabitants without electricity, the technology developed at
Johnson Space Center boasts not only commercial potential, but the
opportunity to significantly impact the lives of those in remote areas.</p>
<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
<p>The solar refrigeration technology, which has resulted in three patents,
was originally intended to cool habitats in space. However,
co-developers Michael Ewert and David Bergeron, who worked on the NASA
Advanced Thermal Team acknowledged the need for a comparable solar
refrigerator that could operate in conjunction with the simple solar
lighting systems already in place on Earth. Working together they
modified the lunar “solar photovoltaic heat pump” device to produce a
refrigerator with a vapor compression, battery-free cooling system that
converts electricity from solar photovoltaic panels into thermal energy
that is stored internally using low-cost phase-change materials. &nbsp;Now
licensed to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sundanzer.com">SunDanzer Refrigeration Inc</a>, the proven system eliminates
reliance on an electric grid, requires no batteries, and stores thermal
energy for efficient use when sunligh<em>t is absent.&nbsp; Designed to work
just about anywhere in the world, the current direct-drive solar
refrigerator is a chest-type cabinet with a 105-liter internal volume, a
lockable top-opening door, a corrosion-resistant coated steel exterior,
and a low-frost system.</em></p>

<p><strong>Making a Difference</strong></p>
<p>Such a scalable, energy-efficient resource can be an incredible asset
where people don’t yet have refrigeration, including remote automated
weather stations, forest stations, cabins, vacation houses, eco-friendly
resorts, farms, street vendor carts, remote medical centers,
transportation vehicles and underdeveloped areas.</p>
<p>For example, in a recent exciting development, SunDanzer has developed
and is marketing one of the first battery-free solar-powered
refrigerators suitable for safely storing vaccines. This unit received
World Health Organization precertification in November 2011. Now those
“without access to electricity that is essential for storage of vaccines
and medicine”…can…”greatly reduce the cost and increase the availability
of vaccines delivered to the poorest, neediest people in remote regions&quot;
says Jim Airola, director of business development at SunDanzer.&nbsp; And
according to Michael Ewert, this is just the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ewert says
“The NASA battery-free solar technology could be used to cool milk,
produce or other consumer products in under-developed regions around the
world, thus creating economic opportunities and improving lives on
Earth.”</p>

<p>This technology is part of NASA’s Innovative Partnerships Program, which
seeks to transfer technology into and out of NASA to benefit the space
program and U.S. industry. NASA invites companies to inquire about the
licensing possibilities for the Solar-Powered Refrigeration Technology
(MSC-22970). For information about this and other technology licensing
opportunities, contact:</p>
