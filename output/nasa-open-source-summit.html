</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>This past week, NASA hosted it’s first Open Source Summit at Ames
Research Center. The event was an overwhelming success and it really set
the stage for the future of Open Source at NASA. If you didn’t have a
chance to attend, the event brought together engineers and policy makers
across NASA and respected members of the open source community to
discuss the challenges with the existing open source policy framework,
and propose modifications that would make it easier for NASA to develop,
release, and use open source software. The summit was an attempt at
something new and revolutionary - we reached out to the public and
actively involved them in a critical conversation related to NASA's
mission.</p>
<p>The event brought together over 700 registered participants, 545 of them
who participated online.We were honored to have top minds in Open Source
at the event including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pascal Finette, Director of Mozilla Labs</li>
<li>Dr. Robert Sutor, Vice President of Open Systems at IBM</li>
<li>Chris Wanstrath, CEO and co-founder of Github</li>
<li>Brian Stevens, CTO and Vice President of Worldwide Engineering at
    Red Hat</li>
<li>David Wheeler, Institute for Defense Analysis/DoD</li>
<li>Linda Cureton, CIO for NASA</li>
<li>Terry Fong, Director of NASA Ames Research Center’s Intelligent
    Robotics Group</li>
<li>Patrick Hogan, NASA World Wind</li>
</ul>
<p>We witnessed the beneficial interaction of physical and virtual
participants coming together and engaging in very productive debates and
brainstorming solutions to our mostpressing challenges. This diverse
community had multiple ways to join the conversation: watch the live
feed via Ustream, comment through chat, join breakout discussions via
Maestro audio conference, and submit feedback on Google docs to shape
the policy discussions. More than 47 topics were suggested for
discussion with more than 638 votes cast. The topmost challenges were
discussed and debated in further detail, producing more than 66
substantivesolutions in response to those barriers.</p>
<p>The event also had a large public reach. Within the last 24 hours,
twitter alone generated 3,199,713 impressions reaching an audience of
1,190,435 followers. There were over 1,200 tweets tracking the many
discussions and extending the conversation even further into the public
sphere.</p>
<p>Open source brings numerous benefits to NASA software projects,
including increased software quality, reduced development costs, faster
development cycles, and reduced barriers to public-private collaboration
through new opportunities to commercialize NASA technology. This
inherently transparent, participatory, and collaborative approach is
revolutionizing the way software is created, improved, and used.
Although open source release has already provided numerous benefits to
NASA, the full benefits of open source can only be realized if NASA is
able to establish the processes, policies, and culture needed to
encourage and support open source development. This will require
expanding open source activities beyond releasing software only after
completion and finding new ways to support two-way collaboration with an
open development community throughout the entire software lifecycle.</p>
