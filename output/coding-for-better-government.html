</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><em>A codeathon is a unique forum for collaborative problem solving that
results in concrete software solutions that can be implemented to
address critical challenges.   A codeathon celebrates software
development in its most positive context—using minimal resources and
maximum brainpower to create outside-the-box solutions in response to
interesting problems.  Codeathon events are technology development
marathons, drawing on the talents and initiative of the best and the
brightest software developers, engineers, designers and technologists
from around the world, who volunteer their time to respond to real-world
problems with solutions than can have immediate impact.</em></p>
<p>As our team leads preparations for the upcoming <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/">International Space
Apps Challenge</a>, I find myself frequently addressing a specific
question: <em>why a codeathon</em>? Why not a more traditional innovation
challenge, or research partnership, or just a request for proposal? It
works for tech companies, but can it really work for government?</p>
<p>Tonight I came across this excellent TED talk by Code for America
founder <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/author/jen/">Jennifer Pahlka</a> called Coding for Better Government.
Jennifer doesn’t just describe the apps that her developers are
creating, but she argues for the way <strong>technology can help engage
citizens to reframe the way government works</strong>.</p>
<p>If you aren’t familiar with <a href="http://codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a>, it’s a public service
opportunity that engages the “web generation” in fellowships to help
governments work better. “Code for America helps governments become more
connected, lean, and participatory through new opportunities for public
service -- both inside and outside government -- so we're not only
making a direct impact everyday, but also creating the relationships and
network for lasting change.”</p>

<p>As Tim O’Reilly noted, government, at its core, is about <strong>doing
together what we can’t do alone</strong>. It’s why we believe that <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/26/citizen-engagement/">citizen
engagement is vital for space exploration</a>, and it’s the key to answer
‘why a codeathon.’</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the better process of a codeathon has the ability to
provide a better product because it engages a full community of citizens
in the real work of their government. NYC’s Chief Digital
Officer <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/rachelsterne">Rachel Sterne</a> recently addressed the power of codeathons in
government, noting that collaboration bridges sectors and connects the
government and technology communities with a shared challenge,
encouraging collaborative problem solving and a more open government.
Codeathons create a mechanism for the public to share feedback and ideas
via access to government decision makers. Creative and innovative
concepts are introduced that help evolve government to be more efficient
and effective. Codeathons also feature an open design process, equipping
developers directly with the data that they need and clearly
demonstrating what the public wants and needs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Politics is not changing; <em>government</em> is changing, and because
government ultimately derives its power from us (remember we the
people) <strong>how we think about it is going to affect how that change
happens</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Events like the Apps Challenge really do represent how a new generation
is tackling the problem of government: with collective action. We need
engaged citizens who are contributing their skills and talents to the
core mission of exploring the unknown and pioneering the future. The key
to improving life on Earth – and enabling us to explore further into the
universe – is to roll up our sleeves, do it together, and then let it go
viral, just like Jennifer describes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[This generation isn’t] fighting that battle we’re all fighting about
who gets to speak – they <em>all</em> get to speak. They don’t care so much
about using their voices… they are using their hands to make their
communities better. When it comes to the big things we need to do
together, are we just going to be a crowd of <em>voices</em>? Or are we also
going to be a crowd of <em>hands</em>?”</p>
</blockquote>

exploration?</p>
