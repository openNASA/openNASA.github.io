</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Educational partnerships offer NASA an avenue for collaboration and
participation far beyond natural boundaries. <a href="http://trainlikeanastronaut.org">Mission X: Train Like an
Astronaut</a> is an international outreach challenge aligning agencies
worldwide to address the critical world health issue of childhood
obesity by offering students the opportunity to ‘train like an
astronaut.’ Each of the space agencies committed to take their
particular expertise to address this global issue by engaging kids in a
vision for space exploration.</p>
<p>The foundation of Mission X is 18 physical and science activities,
developed in tandem between NASA educators and subject matter experts,
that focus on the core physical and mental skills that equip astronauts
for spaceflight. Teams of students learn principles of healthy eating,
exercise and compete for points by finishing training modules. Students
also practice scientific reasoning and teamwork while participating in
hands-on training that targets strength, endurance, coordination,
balance and spatial awareness. Mission X challenges students to be more
physically active; increases awareness of the importance of lifelong
health and conditioning; teaches students how fitness plays a vital role
in human performance for exploration; and inspires and motivates
students to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and
mathematics.</p>
<p>The Mission X partners prioritized international collaboration as well
as global participation. The pilot project, stretching across 10
countries and 15 agencies, was one of the largest non-technical
collaborations across the space program. Mission X also offered a widely
interactive website (built on open source software) where team members,
teachers, and the public could share stories, photos, and videos
regarding their training in 8 languages. The unique platform makes the
multilingual curriculum widely available and offers the public a clear
window into the students’ experience and lessons learned.</p>
<p>At the conclusion of Mission X, many of the teams logged in from 4
different countries for a live downlink from the International Space
Station with astronauts Cady Coleman and Paolo Nespoli. The crewmembers
demonstrated many of the skills the students had learned, answered
questions, and made space real to kids whose imaginations were full of
everything that could be possible. The project team’s commitment to work
together to engage more than 4000 students in physical and mental
training for exploration showed the agencies – and the students – what
was possible.</p>
