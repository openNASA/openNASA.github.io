</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>JSC's ISS<em>Live</em>! project is an exceptional example of NASA’s commitment
to data and mission transparency in an interactive, participatory
environment. For the true space geeks and data lovers among us - I hope
you are excited.</p>
<p>"Just 150 miles above us, the International Space Station (ISS) is
orbiting. (Sidenote: If you haven't seen cool open-source projects like
this [lamp that lights up when the International Space Station is
overhead][], check it out! -AL) Each day, the astronauts on board
perform a variety of activities from exercise, science experiments, and
maintenance. Yet, many on the ground do not know about these daily
activities. National Aeronautics Space Agency/ <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html">Johnson Space Center</a>
(NASA/JSC) innovation creation ISSLive! - an education project - is
working to bridge this knowledge gap with traditional education channels
such as schools, but also non-traditional channels with the
non-technical everyday public. ISSLive! provides a website that
seamlessly integrates <strong>planning and telemetry data, video feeds, 3D
models, and iOS and android applications</strong>. Through the site, users are
able to view astronauts’ daily schedules, in plain English alongside the
original data. As an example, when an astronaut is working with a
science experiment, a user will be able to <strong>read about the activity and
for more detailed activities follow provided links to view more
information</strong> – all integrated into the same site. <strong>Live telemetry data
from a predefined set can also be provided</strong> alongside the activities.
For users to learn more, 3D models of the external and internal parts of
the ISS are available, allowing users to explore the station and even
<strong>select sensors, such as temperature, and view a real-time chart of the
data</strong>. Even ground operations are modeled with a 3D mission control
center, providing users information on the various flight control
disciplines and <strong>showing live data that they would be monitoring</strong>." -
update from ISSLive! team</p>
<p>This project exemplifies NASA's commitment to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html">core values of Open
Government</a>, the future of <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/home/index.html">human spaceflight</a>, and keeping the
public involved and connected to <em>their </em>space program.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Transparency:  </span></strong>Thousands of data
points are downloaded every minute from the Station, and ISS Live! makes
a broad set of that data open and accessible. Furthermore,  ISS Live!
will make an application programming interface (API) available as a web
service for external developers to take ISS data and put it into their
own websites and mobile applications.</p>
<p>A prime challenge for this project has been the translation of the
short, highly abbreviated, activity names, flowcharts, and formats used
in the NASA operations environment, known as operations nomenclature (or
“NASA-ese”), to something more public friendly that does not require
unique knowledge. The translator also functions to protect confidential,
private, or sensitive data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Collaboration:</span></strong> This
collaborative effort between the Mission Operations Directorate, the
Office of Education, the ISS Program, and others around JSC truly
demonstrate the best in working together for public engagement.
Externally, ISS<em>Live!</em> developers are partnering with Human Computer
Interface Design Students at top-ranked Carnegie Mellon University to
create application prototypes and interfaces to display ISS<em>Live!</em> data
for the public.</p>
<p>The project content will additionally serve as the basis for development
of interactive lessons in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
(STEM) fields, inspiring the next generation of explorers.  The
questions 'how does the ISS work' and 'what does the ISS do' are
currently not answered well in a STEM context - but ISSLive! is
committed to doing exactly that, with real models and real data in a
rich multimedia experience.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Participation:</span></strong> You aren't just
watching the Mission Control team look at their screens - you will see
some of what they see. (I wish they had this when I was doing high
school science projects!) Vitally aware of the power of social media,
ISSLive! will incorporate the latest social media feeds relevant to the
ISS, including astronaut twitter feeds, image of the day and real-time
mission video, giving space enthusiasts and life-long learners another
route of participation in NASA's mission.</p>
<p>The anticipated release date for ISSLive! (via the NASA portal and
iTunes) is <strong>October 1</strong>. My iPad can't wait!</p>
