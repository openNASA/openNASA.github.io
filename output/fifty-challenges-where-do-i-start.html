</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><em>`International Space Apps Challenge`_ collaborator `Michael Brennan`_
shares here about how physical and virtual participants can get started
with the `50 carefully curated challenges`_ for the upcoming global
Challenge!</em></p>
<p>One of the things we are most proud of with the 2013 International Space
Apps Challenge is the wealth high <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">quality problem definitions</a> that we
have cultivated with dozens of partners from inside and outside NASA.
But that leave us with an additional challenge on top of it all - where
does one even start?</p>
<p>Start with what interests YOU. We believe there is something for
everyone in this challenge set, whether you are a <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/backyard-poultry-farmer">backyard farmer</a>, a
<a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/no-delays-air-traffic-management">future air traffic controller</a>, or future <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/affordable-rapid-bootstrapping-of-space-industry">space-faring
entrepreneur</a>. No matter what your skillset is or your weekend goals
are, you cannot go wrong by working with a topic that interests you.
Most of these challenges have enough breadth do them that you can
identify a piece that is interesting to you regardless of your
background. See a challenge where you like the topic but you're not
quite sure how you would fit in? Leave a comment for others to see! And
when you arrive at your local event, identify others who might be
interested in that challenge.</p>
<p>When reviewing a challenge that might interest you, think about how
you'd like to spend your weekend. Do you like being told exactly what
needs to get done, down to the most comprehensive detail so you can
ensure maximum impact? We have <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/earth-from-space/">challenges</a>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/scistarter-citizen-science/">for</a>&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/soil-testing-kit/">you</a>. Your skills
added to a well-defined project with clear needs can greatly increase
the likelihood that your work will have a direct impact on our world. Do
you like a big, open-ended challenge that lets you flex your creative
muscle for a solution that reaches for the stars? We have <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/space-station-benefits-to-humanity/">those</a>
<a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/why-we-explore/">challenges</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/we-love-data/">too</a>. The open-ended challenges can be wonderful learning experiences
and creative exercises and it is from those challenges that we often see
the biggest game-changers that we could never have predicted! That is
the wonderful value of massive collaboration around the globe with
like-minded scientists, hackers and innovators.</p>
<p>You'll also notice that there are four challenge categories: Software,
Hardware, Citizen Science, and Data Visualization. This is a good
initial starting point, but don't be fooled by these tags! A &quot;hardware&quot;
challenge may have software components. A &quot;software&quot; challenge may have
a data visualization sub-challenge.</p>
<p>Let's review some of the take-away points here on how to engage:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Focus on topics that interest you personally.</li>
<li>Figure out if you want to work on highly defined challenges, or ones
that are more open-ended.</li>
<li>Utilize the four categories to help narrow down options, but don't be
constrained by them.</li>
<li>Think creatively about how your skills and interests can be applied
to the problems that seem most appealing to you.</li>
<li>Discuss with your peers - both virtually and at events - about how
you can collaborate together on solving these challenges.</li>
</ol>
