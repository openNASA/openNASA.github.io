</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I recently took a fascinating training course on Opening up your
Organization to Innovation. The generally agreed-upon definition of
innovation in the class came from Paul Trott: “Innovation is not a
single action but a total process of interrelated sub processes. It is
not just the conception of a new idea, nor the invention of a new
device, nor the development of a new market. The process is all these
things acting in an integrated fashion.” Developing an ecosystem, if you
will, where fresh ideas and perspectives brew a technology push and a
market pull at just the right moments to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOKRR9sYlzc">increase the awesome</a> across
the board. As we delved into what that meant for our groups and
organizations, we quickly saw how many facets and connotations these
ideas had - and how different they could be in context.</p>
<p>The amount of available material on innovation at NASA is plainly
overwhelming. [NASA powers innovation that creates new jobs, new
markets, and new technologies.][] (Absolutely.) [We talk about ways NASA
encourages and sometimes discourages innovation.][] (It can be true.
Check out the video linked at the end.) Most people think about <a href="http://spinoff.nasa.gov/">spin
offs</a> and <a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-07/ten-tech-innovations-nasas-space-shuttle-trickled-down-non-astronauts">technology innovations</a>, Tang and memory foam and a
number of other items (some of which NASA had nothing to do with, by the
way.) Then there are cool projects like <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/national/summer/home/index.html">Summer of Innovation</a> and
<a href="https://www.innocentive.com/pavilion/NASA">Innovation Pavilions</a> and early-stage i<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/index.html">nnovation development.</a> All
valuable, vital efforts and products that make up the fabric of NASA's
mission to pioneer the future.</p>
<p><strong>But what does innovation mean for us? </strong></p>
<p>As we noted in our reflection following the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OTFoaZFwjXqjcjJtr7tcH28cwD4GMglniJNvIMcg_jM/edit">International Space Apps
Challenge</a>: "Innovation at NASA often reveals itself as a single
advancement in a specific technology. The challenge then lies in
reliably repeating the act of this advancement. We believe that
innovative practices are the key to creating and discovering
state-of-the-art technology. [We] sought to bridge the gap between
innovative technology, and its practice.</p>
<p>"In business and government, there currently exists a set of techniques
for developing new products that has been carried over from the
industrial age: a large team is pulled together, the budget is
established, a business model or project plan is created, a detailed
product road map is developed and rolled out to a user base in phases.
This process has proven itself many times over and is especially
important when building an expensive rocket – the tiniest error could
yield catastrophic failure. Much technological advancement has been made
through this process. However, these time-tested methods of management
do not lend well to seasons of uncertainty. Innovation, on the other
hand, thrives in those seasons."</p>
<p>We're certainly in a season of uncertainty - and it's our commitment to
lean forward into that time and cultivate the new ideas and approaches
that come in this season. The way we see it, <strong>innovation is grounded
in</strong> <strong>curiosity</strong>. Asking the questions <em>what’s on the other side of
that?</em> or <em>what would happen if?</em> opens new frontiers for us and makes
new approaches possible. Exploring where ideas take you and what
technology can do can create answers - and futures - where they may not
have existed before.</p>
<p><strong>What we do about it: </strong></p>
<p>How does the idea of <em>innovation as curiosity</em> shape the work we do at
open.NASA? There are five keys to our approach to innovation in NASA's
policy, technology, and culture.</p>
<p><em>We are committed to openness as the starting point.</em></p>
<p>In a culture that often silos organizations, divides territories, and
protects ideas, [we believe that transparency, collaboration and
participation are vital to creating change][].</p>
<p>The open source mindset transfers us from the innovation-resistant Not
Invented Here attitude to Proudly Found Elsewhere. The
invent-it-ourselves model is generally not sustainable, and it is
inarguably true that the best ideas for any organization are often found
outside of it. In the information age, I have to look for the best ideas
regardless of where they come from and find ways to apply them in my
context.</p>
<p>Without openness, this multidirectional flow of ideas is all but
impossible.</p>
<p><em>We look to build extremely diverse and agile teams.</em></p>
<p>Steve Jobs wrote in 1996: “A lot of people in our industry haven’t had
very diverse experiences. So they don’t have enough dots to connect, and
they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on
the problem. The broader one’s understanding of the human experience,
the better design we will have.”</p>
<p>Instead of filling a slot, we want to develop a person.  In our
experience the former might get the job done, but the latter
accomplishes the mission – and they do that with “a lot of dots to
connect.” They might be designers, technologists, teachers, scientists,
developers or any other number of things. We currently have backgrounds
in business administration, computer science, aerospace engineering,
languages and cultures, interaction design, public policy, and
biotechnology - and that diversity enables exponentially more robust
problem solving. I have heard our JSC Center Director share many times
about how the astronaut corps changed when it went from mostly military
fighter pilots to including doctors, teachers, engineers, scientists and
others who were trained differently - and brought a different
perspective to an issue.</p>
<p><em>We focus on removing obstacles to innovation.</em></p>
<p>There are a number of real obstacles, including funding, tech transfer
constraints, and lack of freedom to collaborate (usually due to
well-intentioned regulations). We spend the time learning what the
regulations are and how to apply them appropriately, searching for
funding alternatives, creating alternative opportunities for
collaboration. We work in <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/08/04/collaborating-virtually-in-a-physical-world/">collaborative spaces</a>, approaching
everything from <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/07/28/working-outside-the-box-at-johnson-space-center-a-cross-post-from-ask-magazine/">facilities</a> to meeting structure and <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/03/28/the-space-to-collaborate-the-space-to-share/">knowledge
management</a> with flexibility.</p>
<p>It can be frustrating. But it's totally worth it.</p>
<p><em>We are committed to opportunities for mass collaborations.</em></p>
<p>Innovative organizations don’t work in isolation. One of the hardest
things about working in government is that it’s often hard to
collaborate with others outside government; you have to know what you
are going to do in order to put agreements in place to do it – which is
often antithetical to the kind of creative work we want to encourage. We
are a small team and can’t possibly have all the experiences in the
world.</p>
<p>Tapping into others' experience and expertise, though, is something we
can do. Mass collaboration is the engagement of a broad group of diverse
participants in collective action toward a specific outcome. Government,
private companies, community initiatives and non-profit organizations
are all experimenting with creating value for themselves and their
stakeholders through mass collaboration.  With <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">hackathons</a>,
<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/22apr_zooniverse/">crowd-sourced data analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume4/AA_4-4_AI_interview_jon_verville.html">wiki communities</a>, <a href="http://code.nasa.gov/project/">open platform
development</a> and crowd-funded enterprises becoming more commonplace,
mass collaboration is no longer a novel experiment.  It is an <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/03/14/coding-for-better-government/">essential
engagement tool</a> already being utilized effectively across the world
in directly mission-relevant efforts.</p>
<p>Open.NASA is focused on making these mass collaboration opportunities as
available and as effective as possible for NASA and our core mission
needs.</p>
<p><em>We are committed to telling the story. </em></p>
<p>Lee Iacocca famously said that "You can have brilliant ideas, but if you
can’t get them across, your ideas won’t get you anywhere." Telling the
story has to be a priority - especially in times of uncertainty. We
spend time asking questions and cultivating new ideas - and then
<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/">writing</a> and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/appel/ask-academy/issues/volume5/5-2_openNASA_accessible.html">speaking</a> and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/u/nasa">storytelling</a> everywhere we can.</p>
<p>As Walt Disney noted, “We keep moving forward, opening new doors, and
doing new things, because we're curious and curiosity keeps leading us
down new paths.” We're following <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/index.html">Curiosity</a> across Mars to see what
we can see, and I'm pretty sure it's more than we can yet imagine.</p>
<p>What about the next planet? And the next solar system? And the next
generation?</p>
