</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Now to answer two very important questions:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>How will judging work?</li>
<li>Will there be awards?</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me first emphasize one *very* important point - the International
Space Apps Challenge is not about competition, it's about collaboration.
It takes many nations working together to build the space station and
keep a human presence in space – and it will take many nations working
together to go further and explore beyond. As one local lead noted,
&quot;It's not about the awards - it's about being part of something
important. We have the skills and we want to share them.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we anticipate amazing results from this weekend and we
want to honor exceptional work and the teams who performed it. So here
is the plan.</p>
<p><strong>1. Judging</strong></p>
<p>To be considered for judging, you must register at
spaceappschallenge.org and submit a project by the end of the two-day
local event. Remember that the most vital consideration at this point is
documenting your work well on spaceappschallenge.org and ensure that it
has as much information as possible, including code repositories and all
participating team members. &nbsp;If you developed software, you must submit
a link to your code to be included in global judging or you will be
disqualified.</p>
<p>Judging will take place at every local event (including at the &quot;virtual&quot;
location), as well as at a global level. Although we provide standard
judging criteria to each local lead, the judging process at each
location is at the discretion of the local lead. In most cases, the
organizer of each event will convene a judging panel at the conclusion
of the two-day hackathon and the panel will identify the top solutions.
The local lead will then nominate two solutions for global recognition.</p>
<p>A total of 168 solutions will make it to the global judging round. Each
team nominated for global recognition will be required to produce a
short 2 minute video explaining their solution and embed the video onto
their challenge page. We highly encourage you to make the video as
creative as possible. If you need a good example, check out the winners
from last year! You will have until May 1, 2013 to submit a video
describing your challenge and solution.</p>
<p>A panel of judges consisting of representatives from NASA and other
governmental and non-governmental organizations will evaluate the top
solutions nominated by the local leads and select the best in class in
the following categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Best Use of Data - The solution that best makes space data accessible
or leverages it to a unique purpose / application.</li>
<li>Best Use of Hardware - The solution that exemplifies the most
innovative use of hardware.</li>
<li>Galactic Impact - The solution that has the most potential to
significantly improve life on Earth or in the universe.</li>
<li>Most Inspiring - The solution that captured our hearts and attention.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the top four best in class awards, there will also be an
award for the solution that has the most public votes . The People's
Choice award will be determined from a public voting process facilitated
through the spaceappschallenge.org website.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>People’s Choice -&nbsp;Determined from a public voting process facilited
through the spaceappschallenge.org website.</li>
</ul>
<p>The winners will be announced on the spaceappschallenge.org and
open.NASA blog on May 22.</p>
<p><strong>2. Awards</strong></p>
<p>Awards may be offered at each local event by organizations who wish to
incentivize work on their challenges or at their location. Additionally,
awards will be offered at the global level.</p>
<p>Examples of what might be offered at local events or by challenge
owners:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Local awards offered at various locations at the discretion of the
local organizer. For example, the National Aerospace Training and
Research (NASTAR) Center will offer personal space training flight
suits to the top solutions at the Philadelphia location.</li>
<li>ESA will offer an open source RepRap printer, custom trophies and
diplomas for the top solutions to the 3D Printing Challenge.</li>
<li>NASA Kennedy Space Center will offer 5-7 launch passes for the top
solutions to the KSC sponsored challenges (Kennedy Space Center 2040,
Bootstrapping of the Space Industry and Deployable Greenhouse). <a class="reference external" href="http://spaceappsksc.tumblr.com/post/48201598539/kennedy-space-center-to-invite-ksc-space-apps-winners">More
information</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following awards will be offered at the global level (additional
details below):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>NASA <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mars">Mars Exploration Program</a> will offer launch invitations to the
upcoming <a class="reference external" href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/maven/">MAVEN</a> launch on 18 November 2013 for the 5 best in class
award winners (5 invitations per project, travel expenses are not
included)</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.nastarcenter.com/">National Aerospace Training and Research (NASTAR) Center</a>will
offer Spaceflight Training packages to the 5 best in class award
winners.</li>
</ul>
<p>As with all great events, terms and conditions will apply and additional
details* will be communicated after winners have been identified. NASA,
of course, reserves the right to cancel launch invitations at any time
at its own discretion.</p>
<p><strong>*Additional Details</strong></p>
<p>More details are included below regarding the global awards from NASA
Mars Exploration Program and NASTAR.</p>
<p>NASA Mars Exploration Program Global Award</p>
<p>NASA’s <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nasa.gov/mars">Mars Exploration Program</a> will extend invitations for a launch
viewing opportunity to the global winners at the 2013 International
Space Apps Challenge in the following categories:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Best Use of Data</li>
<li>Best Use of Hardware</li>
<li>Most Inspiring</li>
<li>Galactic Impact</li>
<li>People’s Choice</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the five best in class winning teams will receive invitations to
the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to view the <a class="reference external" href="http://science.nasa.gov/missions/maven/">Mars Atmosphere and Volatile
Evolution Mission (MAVEN)</a> launch. Each team can designate up to 5 team
members to receive launch invitations as a NASA invited guest. The
invitation is for those team members plus one additional guest each and
is non-transferrable. The invitations are available for U.S. citizens as
well as non-U.S. citizens; all non-U.S. citizens must be approved by
NASA security 45 days prior to the launch. All guests will be
responsible for their own transportation and any costs incurred to
attend the launch viewing.</p>
<p>The teams will also have an opportunity to meet with Mars Exploration
Program and MAVEN (&#64;MAVEN2Mars) team members. The MAVEN mission will
explore the planet’s upper atmosphere, ionosphere and interactions with
the sun and solar wind. Scientists will use MAVEN data to determine the
role that loss of volatile compounds—such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen
dioxide, and water—from the Mars atmosphere to space has played through
time, giving insight into the history of Mars atmosphere and climate,
liquid water, and planetary habitability.</p>
<p>The team must designate the five team members within 30 days after the
global winners have been announced. All team members must be listed on
the submitted solution on spaceappschallenge.org. The winning solutions
are expected to be announced on May 22nd.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions will apply; additional details will be communicated
after winners have been identified. NASA reserves the right to cancel
this invitation at any time at its own discretion.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>National Aerospace Training and Research (NASTAR) Center Award</li>
</ol>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nastarcenter.com/">NASTAR Center</a> is the premier FAA approved commercial aviation and
space training, research, and educational center located just outside
Philadelphia, PA; and is both a local and global supporter of the 2013
International Space Apps Challenge. NASTAR Center will award each of the
five solution team winners a fully paid Introduction to Spaceflight
Training Course where participants will experience firsthand what it is
like to be an Astronaut for a day. The Introduction to Space course
(valued at $500) teaches commercial spaceflight training tips,
techniques, and applications to interested and future commercial
astronaut candidates, and culminates in an “out-of-this world” full
spaceflight mission launch to reentry simulation (up to 3Gs!) using the
world’s most high performance spaceflight simulator, the Phoenix
Centrifuge. For more information, visit www.nastarcenter.com or check
out the online brochure.</p>
<p>The award is good for one person and is valid for one year from date of
issue (see available program dates on www.nastarcenter.com). The award
is transferable to another person, but cannot be applied toward another
NASTAR Center program. NASTAR Center programs are available to U.S.
citizens and non-U.S. citizens. All guests will be responsible for their
own transportation and any costs incurred to attend NASTAR Center
training.</p>
<p>Participation in the NASTAR Center programs is for participants 18 years
and over. The team members must be listed on the submitted solution on
spaceappschallenge.org. Team members must designate the five NASTAR
Center training participants within 30 days after the global winners
have been announced. The winning solutions are expected to be announced
on May 22nd.</p>
<p>Terms and conditions will apply; additional details will be communicated
after winners have been identified. NASTAR Center reserves the right to
cancel this invitation at any time at its own discretion.</p>
