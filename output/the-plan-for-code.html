</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today we are launching <a href="http://code.nasa.gov">code.nasa.gov</a>, the latest member of the open
NASA web family. Through this website, we will continue, unify, and
expand NASA’s open source activities. The site will serve to surface
existing projects, provide a forum for discussing projects and
processes, and guide internal and external groups in open development,
release, and contribution.</p>
<p>In our initial release, we are focusing on providing a home for the
current state of open source at the Agency. This includes guidance on
how to engage the open source process, points of contact, and a
directory of existing projects. By elucidating the process, we hope to
lower the barriers to building open technology in partnership with the
public.</p>
<p>Phase two will concentrate on providing a robust forum for ongoing
discussion of open source concepts, policies, and projects at the
Agency. In our third phase, we will turn to the tools and mechanisms
development projects generally need to be successful, such as
distributed version control, issue tracking, continuous integration,
documentation, communication, and planning/management. During this
phase, we will create and host a tool, service, and process chain to
further lower the burden to going open.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to create a highly visible community hub that
will imbue open concepts into the formulation stages of new hardware and
software projects, and help existing projects transition to open modes
of development and operation. We are going to need your help to get
there! Please use “Share your Ideas,” comment on this post, or email us
at op<span style="display: none;">No spam, please.</span>engov@nasa.gov
to let us know how code can help you, where you would like to see the
site go, and how we might best fulfill our purpose.</p>
<p>We believe that tomorrow’s space and science systems will be built in
the open, and that code.nasa.gov will play a big part in getting us
there. Will your code someday <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch6-2.html">escape our solar system</a> or <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/computers/Ch5-6.html">land on an
alien planet</a>? We’re working to make it happen, and with your help, it
will.</p>
