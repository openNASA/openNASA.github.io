leader and good neighbor in the interdependent community of free
nations..."</em></p>
<p><em>– John F. Kennedy, Nov. 3, 1961 in establishing the United States
Agency for International Development (USAID) </em></p>
<p>I have often expressed the strong belief that the technology developed
for space exploration and the research conducted in space can make [huge
contributions toward solving many of the problems facing our planet][]. 
Beginning tomorrow, I will act on that belief and go "on loan" to the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID). While there,
I will help apply space technology to the challenges facing the
developing world.</p>
<p>President Kennedy's landmark speech at Rice University a little more
than 51 years ago shifted the U.S. space program into high gear. "<a href="http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/seh/ricetalk.htm">We
Choose To Go To The Moon</a>" became the mantra that set our nation on a
peaceful path of space exploration and scientific achievement for the
betterment of all humanity. A few weeks after the Rice speech, and with
the same spirit of progress and innovation that would propel humans to
the moon, <a href="http://www.usaid.gov/who-we-are/usaid-history">President Kennedy established USAID</a> to help lift millions
out of poverty, alleviate suffering and advance the foreign policy
interests of our nation.</p>
<p>Today, NASA and its <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/cooperation/index.html">international partners</a> continue to build on both
legacies. The International Space Station is a premier and unique
research facility that operates around the clock to improve life on
Earth, while it orbits our planet 16 times a day. The research conducted
aboard the space station simply cannot be duplicated anywhere on Earth
and is leading to [new materials, new medicines, a better understanding
of the human body, environmental issues][] facing our planet and much
more.</p>

<p>USAID seeks to "extend a helping hand to those people overseas
struggling to make a better life, recover from a disaster or striving to
live in a free and democratic country." It has embarked on an ambitious
agenda that aims to change the way it does business, with by
establishing new partnerships, emphasizing innovation and focusing
relentlessly on results. This agenda provides the opportunity to
transform USAID and unleash its full potential to achieve high-impact
development. I'm looking forward to being part of the team that
implements these new changes as we strive to more effectively help
improve the lives of others.</p>
<p>NASA and USAID already collaborate on significant programs to apply
scientific and technological solutions to challenges facing millions
around the world. My role will be to help USAID establish a broad
applied research program and to act as program manager for USAID's
participation in the <a href="http://www.unitynode.org">Unity Node</a> project.</p>
<p>The Applied Research Program seeks to find innovative ways to advance
technology development and to apply new technologies to development
challenges. The Unity Node project seeks to build a universal open
source collaborative platform that humanitarian organizations around the
world can use to work together toward their common goals.</p>
<p>USAID's goals are ambitious: protecting human rights, improving global
health, advancing food security and agriculture, improving environmental
sustainability, furthering education, helping societies prevent and
recover from conflicts, and providing humanitarian assistance in the
wake of natural and man-made disasters.</p>
<p>NASA research and experience will greatly help USAID achieve its
ambitious goals. I am excited to be a part of both teams, where I'll be
able to help fulfill NASA's mission of bettering life on Earth by
working with USAID to give it practical application in the developing
world. By combining expertise from NASA and USAID, we will help meet
even more sustainable development challenges on the ground, solving
problems for the world community.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to fly what could be my last flight in a
T-38 jet for a while. As I flew a few laps around the Gulf of Mexico, I
remembered my last moments aboard the International Space Station before
Andrey Borisenko, Sasha Samokutyaev, and I flew a <a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/blog/2011/11/coming-back-down-to-our-fragile-oasis-2/">few laps around our
planet prior to returning to our Fragile Oasis</a>. I felt then, and I
feel now, that I'm completing one chapter of my life and about to begin
a new one. It's an exciting moment, and I can't wait to see first-hand
the results of applying space technology to development challenges.</p>
