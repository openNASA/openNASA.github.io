</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p><em>RHoK works by bringing together experts in development and volunteers
with a broad set of skills in software development and design. The goal
is to produce practical open source solutions to development problems.</em></p>
<p>The interface between domain experts and technical experts is the unique
realm of Random Hacks of Kindness – bringing both sides of the
conversation to the table. As RHoK has happened live around us, it has
been fascinating to see what these events have in common and what
uniquely characterized the local challenges.</p>
<p>Six project areas emerged in RHoK Philadelphia this weekend:<br />
1. A platform to verify local ground weather data in Bolivia with NASA
satellite data<br />
2. A program to provide nearby sources of healthy food for low-income
citizens in Philadelphia via SMS along with a ‘healthy living tip’
(PhillySNAP)<br />
3. A usable, searchable interface to details of Philadelphia City
Council legislation<br />
4. A response to the Tor relay challenge
(<a href="http://www.eff.org/torchallenge">www.eff.org/torchallenge</a>)<br />
5. A site to match non-profit organizations to citizens looking to help
or donate (Splash)<br />
6. A search engine for data on local community hazards in Philadelphia</p>
<p>The diversity of these project topics was pleasantly surprising: climate
change, food sources, government transparency, web anonymity, non-profit
visibility, and environmental hazard awareness. It was also exciting to
see projects that scoured everything from local Philadelphia zip codes
to the huge amount of climatological data that NASA archives on a daily
basis.</p>
<p>We are excited to see this commitment to local relevance happening in
RHoK. The tech community here in Philadelphia is particularly
civic-minded, which lines up with RHoK’s mission to make a serious
social impact through technology.</p>
<p>"I think it's interesting that it seems RHOK Philly had a much more
local bent than most of the other locations. Philadelphia has this
really vibrant, growing civic-oriented technology community. We find
that the developers and designers who are here are here because they
want to be, so there's a great interest in making it a better place to
live. The Philly tech scene has a big focus on making Philly a better
place, but the inspiration, motivation and mission of RHOK is still
there," noted Christopher Wink, co-founder of Technically Philly, a site
covering technology, startups, and venture capital in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The partnership of Technically Philly (<a href="http://technicallyphilly.com/">http://technicallyphilly.com/</a>)
and Drexel University brought developers and subject matter experts
particularly aware of local needs and issues, as well as a number of
entrepreneurs and ”idea-types” - while RHoK partners NASA and World Bank
brought global data and concerns. The projects were created at the
intersection of these values – and the tools developed should be
transferable far beyond Philadelphia.</p>
<p>NASA has also long been aware of this vital global-local connection.
Projects like NASA @ Home and City track the effects of space
exploration into your daily life
(<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasacity/index2.htm">http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/nasacity/index2.htm</a>). Many of these
RHoK projects will start in daily life… and potentially could end up
connected to exploration, or poverty, or open government. These tools
reflect the shift in how we live, how our networked society works, and
how citizens can engage the world around them to make it better.</p>
