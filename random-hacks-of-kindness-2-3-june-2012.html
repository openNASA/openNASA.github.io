						<p>On June 2nd and 3rd 2012, volunteers around the world are coming
together for the <a href="http://rhok.org">Random Hacks of Kindness Global Hackathon</a>.  Born in
2009, Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is the brainchild of a partnership
among Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, <span class="caps">HP</span>, <span class="caps">NASA</span> and the World Bank.  The RHoK
international community is over 4000 strong, encompassing not only
computer programmers but also engineers, designers, web experts, project
managers and other tech-savvy do-gooders, as well as subject matter
experts in areas as diverse as disaster risk management, climate change,
water, healthcare and human rights.  This group of unlikely
collaborators works together to define challenges facing humanity in
local communities all around the world, and then to rapidly prototype
solutions during an intensive weekend of round-the-clock&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Fueled by copious amounts of coffee and a desire to make a difference in
the world, “<em>hackers for humanity</em>” working alongside subject matter
experts have created innovative solutions to pressing problems in their
communities.<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A team at RHoK in Trento, Italy designed a mobile application that
    <a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/81546">connects charities distributing food to needy populations</a> with
    restaurants and businesses with excess food to&nbsp;donate.</li>
<li>A team at RHoK Philadelphia designed a web platform enabling
    homeless service providers to easily [identify empty beds and open
    soup kitchens][] for Philadelphia and New Jersey homeless&nbsp;populations.</li>
<li>A team at RHoK Washington <span class="caps">D.C.</span> designed a tool to [visualize complex
    landslide risk algorithms][], making the information accessible to
    local mayors and urban planners making building&nbsp;decisions.</li>
<li>A team at RHoK Sydney created a crowdsourcing tool to allow
    Australian citizens to <a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/2555">rapidly report and respond to Bushfires</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the two short years since its inception, RHoK communities have sprung
up in close to 50 cities around the world, with the support of over 180
diverse partner organizations, from government and academia, to the
non-profit and private&nbsp;sectors.</p>
<p>RHoK Global in June 2012 will be taking place simultaneously in 21+
cities globally, from Seattle to Santo Domingo, from Philadelphia to&nbsp;Prague.</p>
<p>Be a part of this global movement to make the world a better place
through the innovative use of technology.  Register at
<a href="http://www.rhok.org/events">www.rhok.org/events</a> and come out to hack for humanity in a city near
you on June 2nd and 3rd,&nbsp;2012!</p>
