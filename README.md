openNASA Archive
================

In 2007, a small group of people began an intentional, collaborative experiment in open, transparent, and direct communication about your space program. Our goal was to enable your direct participation in exploring and contributing to NASAâ€™s mission.

Many of us have since begun new adventures. This site stands as an archive of the accomplishments of the openNASA experiment.
