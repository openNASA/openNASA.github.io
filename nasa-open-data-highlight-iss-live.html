						<p><span class="caps">JSC</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">ISS</span><em>Live</em>! project is an exceptional example of <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s commitment
to data and mission transparency in an interactive, participatory
environment. For the true space geeks and data lovers among us - I hope
you are&nbsp;excited.</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Just 150 miles above us, the International Space Station (<span class="caps">ISS</span>) is
orbiting. (Sidenote: If you haven&#8217;t seen cool open-source projects like
this [lamp that lights up when the International Space Station is
overhead][], check it out! -<span class="caps">AL</span>) Each day, the astronauts on board
perform a variety of activities from exercise, science experiments, and
maintenance. Yet, many on the ground do not know about these daily
activities. National Aeronautics Space Agency/ <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/home/index.html">Johnson Space Center</a>
(<span class="caps">NASA</span>/<span class="caps">JSC</span>) innovation creation ISSLive! - an education project - is
working to bridge this knowledge gap with traditional education channels
such as schools, but also non-traditional channels with the
non-technical everyday public. ISSLive! provides a website that
seamlessly integrates <strong>planning and telemetry data, video feeds, 3D
models, and iOS and android applications</strong>. Through the site, users are
able to view astronauts’ daily schedules, in plain English alongside the
original data. As an example, when an astronaut is working with a
science experiment, a user will be able to <strong>read about the activity and
for more detailed activities follow provided links to view more
information</strong> – all integrated into the same site. <strong>Live telemetry data
from a predefined set can also be provided</strong> alongside the activities.
For users to learn more, 3D models of the external and internal parts of
the <span class="caps">ISS</span> are available, allowing users to explore the station and even
<strong>select sensors, such as temperature, and view a real-time chart of the
data</strong>. Even ground operations are modeled with a 3D mission control
center, providing users information on the various flight control
disciplines and <strong>showing live data that they would be monitoring</strong>.&#8221; -
update from ISSLive!&nbsp;team</p>
<p>This project exemplifies <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s commitment to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/plan/index.html">core values of Open
Government</a>, the future of <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/home/index.html">human spaceflight</a>, and keeping the
public involved and connected to <em>their </em>space&nbsp;program.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Transparency:  </span></strong>Thousands of data
points are downloaded every minute from the Station, and <span class="caps">ISS</span> Live! makes
a broad set of that data open and accessible. Furthermore,  <span class="caps">ISS</span> Live!
will make an application programming interface (<span class="caps">API</span>) available as a web
service for external developers to take <span class="caps">ISS</span> data and put it into their
own websites and mobile&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>A prime challenge for this project has been the translation of the
short, highly abbreviated, activity names, flowcharts, and formats used
in the <span class="caps">NASA</span> operations environment, known as operations nomenclature (or
“<span class="caps">NASA</span>-ese”), to something more public friendly that does not require
unique knowledge. The translator also functions to protect confidential,
private, or sensitive&nbsp;data.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Collaboration:</span></strong> This
collaborative effort between the Mission Operations Directorate, the
Office of Education, the <span class="caps">ISS</span> Program, and others around <span class="caps">JSC</span> truly
demonstrate the best in working together for public engagement.
Externally, <span class="caps">ISS</span><em>Live!</em> developers are partnering with Human Computer
Interface Design Students at top-ranked Carnegie Mellon University to
create application prototypes and interfaces to display <span class="caps">ISS</span><em>Live!</em> data
for the&nbsp;public.</p>
<p>The project content will additionally serve as the basis for development
of interactive lessons in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math
(<span class="caps">STEM</span>) fields, inspiring the next generation of explorers.  The
questions &#8216;how does the <span class="caps">ISS</span> work&#8217; and &#8216;what does the <span class="caps">ISS</span> do&#8217; are
currently not answered well in a <span class="caps">STEM</span> context - but ISSLive! is
committed to doing exactly that, with real models and real data in a
rich multimedia&nbsp;experience.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #993300">Participation:</span></strong> You aren&#8217;t just
watching the Mission Control team look at their screens - you will see
some of what they see. (I wish they had this when I was doing high
school science projects!) Vitally aware of the power of social media,
ISSLive! will incorporate the latest social media feeds relevant to the
<span class="caps">ISS</span>, including astronaut twitter feeds, image of the day and real-time
mission video, giving space enthusiasts and life-long learners another
route of participation in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p>The anticipated release date for ISSLive! (via the <span class="caps">NASA</span> portal and
iTunes) is <strong>October 1</strong>. My iPad can&#8217;t&nbsp;wait!</p>
