						<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> has a clear mandate for the &#8220;widest practicable and appropriate
dissemination of information concerning its activities and the results&#8221;
– and the <a href="http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Technical Reports Server</a> is just one example of how
the Agency is leading the way in transparency and open data. Constant,
worldwide access to historic data and documentation in a single, simple
interface demonstrates <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s commitment to not only make the material
available but make it easily locatable and&nbsp;useful.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">NASA</span> Technical Reports Server provides the public access to <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s
current and historical technical literature and engineering results. It
includes the <span class="caps">NACA</span> collection, the <span class="caps">NASA</span> collection, and the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Image
eXchange. Over 500,000 aerospace-related citations, over 200,000
full-text online documents, and over 500,000 images and videos are
available through a common interface. The search tool permits refinement
by category or through the use of a concept cloud. All information found
in the <span class="caps">NTRS</span> was created or funded by <span class="caps">NASA</span>, and it is unlimited,
unclassified, and publicly&nbsp;available.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NTRS</span> logged 3.7 million visits last year and is truly a 24/7 and
worldwide. Taking a look at access patterns over a typical week in 2010,
one can see that there is no significant fall off in use in terms of
both day of the week and time of day. Over a quarter of the traffic to
<span class="caps">NTRS</span> comes from foreign internet domains, the top five being: United
Kingdom, Australia, Germany, China, and Japan. There is no surprise that
Google registers as the top referrer to <span class="caps">NTRS</span> at 14% after direct
traffic. This percentage share rises to 31% after adding in the rest of
Google&#8217;s international presence. <span class="caps">NTRS</span> is also a source to Science.gov
and Worldwidescience.org. <span class="caps">NTRS</span> has a very strong brand name as shown by
top search phases in referring search engines being comprised of &#8220;<span class="caps">NTRS</span>,&#8221;
&#8220;<span class="caps">NASA</span> Technical Report Server,&#8221; and derivations&nbsp;thereof.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NTRS</span> promotes the dissemination of <span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="caps">STI</span> to the widest audience
possible by allowing its information to be harvested by sites using the
Open Archives Initiative Protocol for <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/">Metadata Harvesting (<span class="caps">OAI</span>-<span class="caps">PMH</span>)</a>.
<span class="caps">OAI</span>-<span class="caps">PMH</span> defines a mechanism for information technology systems to
exchange citation information using the open standards <span class="caps">HTTP</span> (Hypertext
Transport Protocol) and <span class="caps">XML</span> (Extensible Markup&nbsp;Language).</p>
<p>Ever wondered how interesting the history of the space program is? Here
are a few examples of just a few of the treasures found in the <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Technical Reports&nbsp;Server:</p>

<p>This document is a conference paper entitled, &#8220;Suggestions for
Popularizing Civilian Aviation,&#8221; written by &#8220;Britain&#8217;s Lady Lindy,&#8221; Lady
Heath, Sophie Mary Eliott-Lynn, Among these suggestions, is the idea
that &#8220;in all-metal aircraft smoking is permissible, which is an
important item of comfort on long journeys&#8221; (p.&nbsp;12).</p>

<p>The Saturn V handbook was created to provide the astronaut with a single
source reference guide for the characteristics and functions of the
launch vehicle and is a fascinating reflection of historic <span class="caps">NASA</span> work. It
also inspired public conversation on Twitter by users who were quite
enthusiastic to page through the details for the building, resourcing,
usage, and maintenance of the&nbsp;rocket.</p>

<p>Early <span class="caps">NASA</span> research of winglets by Collier Trophy-winner, Richard T.
Whitcomb, served as a foundation for commercialized winglets familiar to
today&#8217;s frequent flyers. Winglets have been attributed with saving over
two billion gallons of jet fuel over the years.

<p>From the abstract of this paper analyzing future utilization of space
resources: &#8220;Over the last four years, the <span class="caps">ISRU</span> project has taken what
was essentially an academic topic with lots of experimentation but
little engineering and produced near-full-scale systems that have been
demonstrated. In 2008 <span class="amp">&amp;</span> again in early 2010, systems that could produce
oxygen from lunar soils (or their terrestrial analogs) were tested at a
lunar analog site on a volcano in&nbsp;Hawaii.&#8221;</p>
