						<p>Among the lists of must-have apps so frequently in tech news, there is
one constant: weather apps. Everyone has one. Perhaps you’ve found that
one perfect weather app and would never stray. Perhaps you’ve read this
sentence in too many tech reviews to believe it, but it’s the truth:
you’ve never seen a weather app like this&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>This is Sol, the world’s first interplanetary weather app, winner of the
award for Best Use of Data at the 2013 International Space Apps&nbsp;Challenge.</p>
<p>Its makers were drawn to the ubiquity of weather apps when hatching
ideas for the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/wish-you-were-here/" title="Wish You Were Here challenge">Wish You Were Here</a> challenge at Space Apps Kansas
City. Everybody has a weather app, they thought—why not use that to
connect people to&nbsp;space?</p>
<p>According to teammate and president of Kansas City-based Ingenology,
Mike Wilson, the team was drawn to the universality of the challenge.
Teammate Jessica Meurers brought her love of science to the table and
began to discuss her ideas with another designer. They discovered they
had independently come up with similar ideas. In this organic way, the
entire team dove into the&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<p>One of their goals was to address <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Mars weather data, which is
difficult for users to grab. So, they made a developer friendly, open
source <span class="caps">REST</span> <span class="caps">API</span>, the Mars Atmospheric Aggregation System, the code for
which is open and available for tinkering. This is based on the Rover
Environmental Monitoring Station data provided by <a href="http://www.cab.inta.es/en/inicio" title="Centro de Astrobiología">Centro de
Astrobiología</a>.</p>
<p>They knew design would be key: apps with beautiful graphics are hard to
put down. Sharing is also important, so they integrated a sharing
feature. Users are able to Tweet or share the weather from Gale Crater
on Mars or from anywhere on&nbsp;Earth.</p>
<p>You can download the result for yourself now in the App Store, for
iPhone or iPad, and commenters are already asking for more planets. The
Android app will be published in&nbsp;June.</p>
