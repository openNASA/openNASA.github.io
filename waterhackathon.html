						<p><em>Note:</em> <em>We wanted to highlight another great project that <span class="caps">NASA</span> is
supporting under the leadership of the World Bank. You see, the issues
involved in insuring a clean water supply in less-developed countries
aren&#8217;t so different from the issues we face insuring a clean water
supply on the Space Station or on other planets. Interested in potential
solutions in the water sector? Wonder how <span class="caps">NASA</span> and other government
agencies can apply their data and the experience to help make the world
a better place? Want to know more about how you can participate? <span class="caps">ALL</span>
kinds of expertise is useful. Read on&#8230; and come join&nbsp;us!</em></p>
<p><strong>What’s a hackathon?</strong>A hackathon event is an intensive marathon of
brainstorming and programming, where software developers and designers
collaborate to create new tools for solving a set of&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p><strong>What is WaterHackathon?</strong> WaterHackathon is a hackathon dedicated to
hacking problems related to water-related issues, such&nbsp;as:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to  safe drinking water and adequate&nbsp;sanitation</li>
<li>flooding and drought (i.e., climate change&nbsp;issues)</li>
<li>irrigation and watershed&nbsp;management</li>
<li>environmental&nbsp;pollution</li>
</ul>
<div>

**Why a hackathon dedicated to water?** Water is essential to sustain
life and economic development, yet the number of people without access
to clean water and sanitation remains daunting.

-   2.6 billion without sanitation (of whom 1.1 billion are still
    defecating in the open).
-   Nearly one billion without access to safe drinking water.

Diseases related to unsafe drinking water and lack of sanitation are the
biggest single challenges in global public health today.

-   Health studies have shown that 80% of all diseases in the world are
    water-related.
-   Children are especially vulnerable to health risks; the majority of
    the 42,000 deaths that occur every week from unsafe water and
    unhygienic living conditions are to children under five.
-   More children die of diarrhea than of AIDs, malaria and <span class="caps">TB</span> combined.

The sustainable management of water resources has also acquired a new
urgency in the face a global population expected to reach 9 billion by
2050, increased food demands, and increased hydrological variability
caused by climate change.

-   Irrigation produces around half of the world&#8217;s food and accounts for
    about three quarters of water withdrawals worldwide.
-   Water scarcity will affect at least 30% of the world&#8217;s population in
    2050.
-   Climate change exacerbates flood and drought challenges as it makes
    water resources harder to manage, and increases risk and
    uncertainty.

New ideas, better, open data and innovative tools are needed to respond
to this global water crisis. In search of just that, the World Bank and
partners are joining forces in order to seed a new community of software
developers, designers and water experts to (1) identify critical global
challenges and project specific problems in order to (2) develop
technological tools to help respond to them.

<p><strong>When and where is the WaterHackathon?</strong> The two-day marathon hacking
event will take place <strong>October 21 – 23, 2011</strong>, with multiple global
locations bringing together software developers to hack on real-world
water problems.  Confirmed sites include: Bangalore, Cairo, Kampala,
London, Nairobi, Tel Aviv, and Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>. See
<a href="http://www.waterhackathon.org">waterhackathon.org</a> for more information on individual&nbsp;sites.</p>
<p>On Twitter, organizers and participants will be sharing real-time
updates using the hashtag <strong>#waterhack</strong>. Follow <strong>@randomhacks</strong> and
<strong>@WSPWorldBank</strong> — join in the&nbsp;conversation!</p>
<p><strong>Who is behind the WaterHackathon?</strong> WaterHackathon is organized by
the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/water">World Bank</a> and <a href="http://www.wsp.org">Water and Sanitation Program</a>, along with
technology partners from <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/"><span class="caps">NASA</span></a> and <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random Hacks of Kindness</a> and
dedicated local partner organizations in each event site. Random Hacks
of Kindness is a partnership between Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, <span class="caps">HP</span>, <span class="caps">NASA</span>
and the World Bank.  WaterHackathon is supported by the <a href="http://water.worldbank.org/water/wpp">Water
Partnership Program</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Who can participate in the hacking?</strong>We invite programmers, software
designers, <span class="caps">GIS</span> specialists, social media experts, graphic designers,
translators, along with experts in water-related issues and water users
to <a href="http://www.rhok.org/events">register at rhok.org/events</a>.</p>
<p><strong>How can non-hackers get involved?  </strong>Do you have a water-related
problem that needs solving? <a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems">Share it</a> with us. We need water experts
and water users from around the world to submit their problems. While
not all these problems will lend themselves to technology solutions, we
believe documenting pressing local water problems is the first step to
breaking down barriers for non-traditional partners. For those problems
that do get solved, we will share the solutions and support teams in
getting their applications deployed. See <a href="http://www.rhok.org/problem-definition-category/water">examples of water problems</a>.</p>
