						<p>Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative
encompassing a core team of collaborators including <span class="caps">NASA</span>, World Bank,
Microsoft, Google, Yahoo and <span class="caps">HP</span>, an ever expanding ecosystem of
supporting organizations, and a community of over 5,500 innovators in
over 30 countries collectively working to make the world a better&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>The effort, which is only three years old, has resulted in 177
hackathons in 37 different countries producing thousands of solutions.
There are a number of past RHoK projects that serve as guiding examples
of what’s possible in just 48 hours, from those developed in the early
days and still in use like <span class="caps">CHASM</span>, Open Street Map Tasking Manager,
Risk-in-a-Box (now InaSAFE), First Responder and Caritas Disaster
Mapping, as well as Bushfire Connect, to more recent RHoK projects like
PhillySNAP, Sheltr, WaterVoices, AdHawk, Bring the Food, Yo! Philly
Votes, Councilmatic, FourTeachersProject and&nbsp;Taarifa.</p>
<p>We have released an annual report on the Random Hacks of Kindness global
initiative that describes its beginnings, the hackathon process, the
initiatives impact, the amazing community, and how you can be a part of&nbsp;it.</p>
