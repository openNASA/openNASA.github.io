						<p>Each year, <span class="caps">NASA</span> celebrates one invention out of the many “spinoff”
technologies that the agency inspires as the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Commercial Innovation
of the Year.  This past spring, the prestigious title was bestowed on a
solar refrigeration solution designed to support life on the moon, but
has huge application here on Earth.   With approximately 2 billion of
Earth’s inhabitants without electricity, the technology developed at
Johnson Space Center boasts not only commercial potential, but the
opportunity to significantly impact the lives of those in remote&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;solution</strong></p>
<p>The solar refrigeration technology, which has resulted in three patents,
was originally intended to cool habitats in space. However,
co-developers Michael Ewert and David Bergeron, who worked on the <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Advanced Thermal Team acknowledged the need for a comparable solar
refrigerator that could operate in conjunction with the simple solar
lighting systems already in place on Earth. Working together they
modified the lunar “solar photovoltaic heat pump” device to produce a
refrigerator with a vapor compression, battery-free cooling system that
converts electricity from solar photovoltaic panels into thermal energy
that is stored internally using low-cost phase-change materials.  Now
licensed to <a href="http://www.sundanzer.com">SunDanzer Refrigeration Inc</a>, the proven system
eliminates reliance on an electric grid, requires no batteries, and
stores thermal energy for efficient use when sunligh<em>t is absent. 
Designed to work just about anywhere in the world, the current
direct-drive solar refrigerator is a chest-type cabinet with a 105-liter
internal volume, a lockable top-opening door, a corrosion-resistant
coated steel exterior, and a low-frost&nbsp;system.</em></p>

<p><strong>Making a&nbsp;Difference</strong></p>
<p>Such a scalable, energy-efficient resource can be an incredible asset
where people don’t yet have refrigeration, including remote automated
weather stations, forest stations, cabins, vacation houses, eco-friendly
resorts, farms, street vendor carts, remote medical centers,
transportation vehicles and underdeveloped&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p>For example, in a recent exciting development, SunDanzer has developed
and is marketing one of the first battery-free solar-powered
refrigerators suitable for safely storing vaccines. This unit received
World Health Organization precertification in November 2011. Now those
“without access to electricity that is essential for storage of vaccines
and medicine”…can…”greatly reduce the cost and increase the availability
of vaccines delivered to the poorest, neediest people in remote regions&#8221;
says Jim Airola, director of business development at SunDanzer.  And
according to Michael Ewert, this is just the beginning.   Ewert says
“The <span class="caps">NASA</span> battery-free solar technology could be used to cool milk,
produce or other consumer products in under-developed regions around the
world, thus creating economic opportunities and improving lives on&nbsp;Earth.”</p>
<p><strong>Want More&nbsp;Information?</strong></p>
<p>This technology is part of <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Innovative Partnerships Program, which
seeks to transfer technology into and out of <span class="caps">NASA</span> to benefit the space
program and <span class="caps">U.S.</span> industry. <span class="caps">NASA</span> invites companies to inquire about the
licensing possibilities for the Solar-Powered Refrigeration Technology
(<span class="caps">MSC</span>-22970). For information about this and other technology licensing
