						<p><em>This post by <a href="http://garretfitzpatrick.com/contact/">Garret Fitzpatrick</a> was originally written in October
2008. We share it here to remind us to step back and remember why we are
here - and what&#8217;s worth staying here&nbsp;for. </em></p>
<p>Whew-I made&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>One full year on the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>(<span class="caps">NASA</span>, I&#8217;m writing you this blog entry as a combined present for our
anniversary and your 50^th^ birthday. Even though I&#8217;m technically late
on both and you might have been hoping for a more substantial present
like a bouquet of tulips or a nice dinner at that fancy French
restaurant in town or a pearl necklace-yeah right on my salary!-I hope
you won&#8217;t use that in future arguments over which <span class="caps">TV</span> show we&#8217;ll watch on
Tuesday nights. I&#8217;m still voting for <em>House</em>, for the&nbsp;record).</p>
<p>I started full-time at <span class="caps">NASA</span> back in August 2007, having graduated the
previous May after spending five co-op tours at <span class="caps">JSC</span> over the previous
four years. They say you usually don&#8217;t start talking to yourself or
addressing the agency as your significant other for at least 10 years,
so I&#8217;m thrilled to be ahead of the curve on this&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>A year might not sound like all that significant to most, but to me,
it&#8217;s a huge milestone. An-all-too-welcoming stroll down memory lane
brings me back the image of a college junior, tying a tie eight times
before getting it right the morning of his first day as a co-op, then
staring wide-eyed at the monster Saturn V rocket lying on its side in
the grass at the main gate of the center, an ominous sentry to the
unsuspecting kid who still couldn&#8217;t believe he had landed an interview
with the agency, let alone to be actually sitting in his car outside its&nbsp;gates.</p>
<p>But apparently I tied that tie well enough to get hired on as a
full-timer, joining the ranks of men and women whose ingenuity had
inspired me to crack open the differential equations textbooks (ugh) and
survive the all-night college library exam studying (read: cramming) to
get to where I am now, celebrating a year of ups and downs, triumphs and
failures, exploring questions and trying to make the agency a little
better place than when I got&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>Wednesday I drove through the gates at <span class="caps">JSC</span> and I thought of that first
day on the job. I glanced at the (relatively) recently-built giant
building enclosing the massive Saturn V; the beast of a rocket built to
billow colossal plumes of fire and smoke and taught to reach constantly
upward into the heavens as the height of our audaciousness, fueled by a
defiant dream and the lure of the unknown, now asked to bathe in shadow,
awaiting a lifetime of staring at a wall of corrugated aluminum siding
while tourists gawk at the grandeur of man&#8217;s creations and <span class="caps">NASA</span>
employees drive past, largely oblivious to its tormented suffering in
their rush to meet the next impossible&nbsp;schedule.</p>
<p>A rocket that took astronauts to the moon all those years&nbsp;ago&#8230;</p>
<p>What if I had just finished up my first year in 1968, instead of 2008?
Would I have this same excitement? Would I be so driven? Or, more
importantly, would I be talking to myself like&nbsp;this?</p>
<p>I wonder what it was like to drive through that same gate on the way to
a day on the job, working towards a goal of lifting humans to heights
never before reached, to our knowledge, in the history of the universe.
To live in a world where man had not yet walked on the surface of
another heavenly body. What was that world like when those
preconceptions of man&#8217;s limitations were&nbsp;shattered?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine such a world because the people who drove past that gate
and many others like it for so long have given me the gift of seeing the
world through different&nbsp;eyes.</p>
<p><strong>In our rush to figure out how to improve the openness of the agency
and either anoint or discredit the past, current, or future generations
of engineers and rocket scientists, leaders and dreamers, heroes and
soldiers of exploration, let&#8217;s not forget to take a step back and smile
at that&nbsp;gift.</strong></p>
<p>Even if some of us weren&#8217;t around when it was&nbsp;given.</p>
