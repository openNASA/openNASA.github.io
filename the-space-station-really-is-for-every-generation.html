						<p>As a child, the space shuttle completely ignited my imagination about
exploration. I watched every space movie I could find, and carried
around a well-worn copy of the Space Shuttle Operators Manual in one
hand and my astronaut doll in the other. My elementary school classes
crowded around the television to watch each launch, and those brave
orange-suited astronauts were the first to teach me about hard work,
adventure, and&nbsp;courage.</p>
<p>I confess that somehow the space station has never quite captured my
heart in the same way. I’ve never watched it launch; I’ve never touched
its tiles or seen it fly. Long minutes on the front lawn, squinting at
the sky, looking for streaks of light across the horizon – it’s hard to
connect that to eleven years of continuous human presence in&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing I’m learning: my exploration dreams have to grow
up. The lessons of the International Space Station are different than
those of the shuttle – and vital in a whole new&nbsp;way.</p>
<p><strong>The station teaches me that it takes time to build a real future in
space.</strong> We started talking about a space station in the early 80s, and
launched the first node in the late 90s. More than ten years later, we
still have a few modules to go. We’re in this thing for the long&nbsp;haul.</p>
<p><strong>The station teaches me that experience builds capacity.</strong> The more we
live and work in space, the more skill and expertise we are gaining to
enable us to accomplish our future – whether the Moon, Mars, or
somewhere beyond. Living in space isn’t the same as visiting&nbsp;space.</p>
<p><strong>The station teaches me that science is really what changes things.</strong>
Exploration is awesome and noble and romantic – and our chief goal must
remain to explore the unknown. But the reality is that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ErLtE3Lf9s">science enables
us to make sense of what we find there</a> – and put it to good&nbsp;use.</p>
<p><strong>The station teaches me that together, we can do anything.</strong> If we can
surmount budget crises and bureaucracies and international relations to
do something as amazing as this – in the harsh and unforgiving vacuum of
space – then how could we not do the same thing on&nbsp;earth?</p>
<p>I still frequently wear a sterling silver space shuttle around my neck;
somehow I imagine that it will always be my first love. The shuttle
taught me about humans going to space. The station teaches me about
space coming to humans on earth – not just for a handful of crewmembers
- but for <em>all</em>&nbsp;humanity.</p>
<p>How do we tell that story? How do we get the public to connect to the
space station the same way that millions flocked to watch shuttle
launches? Most importantly, how do we engage the world in the kind of
<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/12/01/the-collaboration-project/">international collaboration</a> that built the space station and makes
the future&nbsp;possible?</p>
<p>People are creating amazing open source citizen science projects like
the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/natronics/status/135819832867299328"><span class="caps">ISS</span> globe</a>  and the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5811126/iss-lamp-illuminates-when-the-space-station-is-near"><span class="caps">ISS</span>&nbsp;light.</a></p>
<p>You can follow live <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/tracking/index.html">station tracking</a> and find <a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/realdata/sightings/index.html">sightings</a> near you
and interact with the station crew both #FromSpace and #FromEarth via
<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nasa_astronauts">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/116214152295449083654/posts">Google+</a>&#8230; or even <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ix7ak/iama_son_of_nasa_astronaut_mike_fossum_who_is/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>You can explore the inside of the station and mission control on <a href="http://spacestationlive.jsc.nasa.gov/"><span class="caps">ISS</span>
Live!</a> - and in the future you will be able to grab live station
telemetry via <span class="caps">API</span>.</p>
<p>You can watch (probably over and over, like I have) this <a href="http://vimeo.com/32430473">amazing
time-lapse view</a> of the trip around the globe and back to&nbsp;Earth.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s what encourages me the most: there are <a href="https://plus.google.com/115200104175185451947/posts/TioAfWGBGgf">so</a> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/liz-warren-nasa-scientist.html">many</a> who
are <a href="http://www.opennasa.com/2010/05/26/tell-me-a-story/#more-1799">telling this story</a>. Our flight doctors - with incredible
expertise in telemedicine to long-term remote, closed environments -
<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/news/chile_assistance.html">took that experience to Chile</a> to help rescue the trapped miners. We
are using the lessons of long-duration spaceflight to make <a href="http://www.henryford.com/body.cfm?id=56625">ultrasound
technology</a> available in places that need it most. The <a href="http://blog.ted.com/2011/07/14/the-orbital-perspective-ron-garan-from-the-iss/">orbital
perspective</a> is inspiring <a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org/projects/">humanitarian projects</a> all over the world
to help preserve our fragile oasis. Even kids are <a href="http://youtu.be/_bVHSrDBZEU">getting inspired</a>
to <a href="http://trainlikeanastronaut.org/">train like an astronaut</a>- working together to get stronger and
healthier - combating the global issue of childhood&nbsp;obesity.</p>
<p><strong>What inspires <span class="caps">YOU</span> about the space station? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYh6BD6-Hc8">What kind of world</a> will
