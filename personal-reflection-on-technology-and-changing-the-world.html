						<p>I&#8217;ve always been sensitive about water. I remember camp counselors
amused when I would turn off the shower to take the time to shampoo my
hair; it felt like a waste to just let it run. I almost had a panic
attack at a water fountain in a Barnes and Noble once, the first summer
I came back from Afghanistan. The water was running continuously for
some reason, and it wouldn&#8217;t stop. I had just been in a place where so
many didn&#8217;t have access to water, where we saved the last inch of our
daily bottle to brush our teeth at night - and here we wasted it so&nbsp;mindlessly.</p>
<p>I remember walking through rice paddies in rural Java with other women
who had traveled long distances with long-reused containers to get clean
water. We were very careful about what we consumed there, but I left
Indonesia with a case of giardia that took weeks to get over. 1 in 8
people in the world lack access to clean water supplies. 3.57 million
people die each year from water-related diseases. It&#8217;s not just that
they get sick - they <em>die</em>. 98% of these deaths are in the developing&nbsp;world.</p>
<p>Now I work for <span class="caps">NASA</span>, and we can turn urine into water and have a big
party to celebrate it. There isn&#8217;t available water in space, either,
just like in many parts of the world, but the six astronauts who live on
the space station can create their own water - and it&#8217;s more pure than
many of us get out of the tap. One of my colleagues plans and implements
community water purification systems in Rwanda and applies the lessons
learned there to creating water out of lunar regolith. The moon isn&#8217;t
that different from parts of rural Africa: bare, rocky, little water, no
infrastructure. Clean, efficient technologies are providing clean water
for Rwanda, and those same experiences will be applied to water
production and life support on the moon. Creativity, technology, and
commitment to a purpose make all the&nbsp;difference.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think technology is the answer to everything; sometimes it is
the less technical solution that is most sustainable. My daily life is
teaching me, though, that we have an abundance of readily available
technology that could meet all sorts of human needs, if we will be
inventive in our methodology and our application. I&#8217;m so excited to get
engaged daily in collaborations between students, businesspeople and
scientists collaborating to meet technical and operational needs - and
often social needs at the same time. What affects me the most, though,
is the constant reminder to not just find a technology, but to <strong>engage
your users</strong> to find a solution. Technology is not the agent of change -
people are. But technology can often put all the right tools in their
hands to change their world - and maybe their whole&nbsp;universe.</p>
