						<p>This October, <span class="caps">NASA</span> will send astronauts and engineers to the National
Marine Sanctuary in Key Largo to live underwater for 10 days as part of
the <span class="caps">NEEMO</span>-15 Mission. <span class="caps">NEEMO</span> stands for “<span class="caps">NASA</span> Extreme Environment Mission
Operations”, and is a project that trains <span class="caps">NASA</span> explorers for missions to
planetary destinations. The crewmembers of this mission will live in the
<span class="caps">NOAA</span> Aquarius habitat, which has been used by Marine Biologists to study
coral and marine life for years. As part of <span class="caps">NEEMO</span>-15, <span class="caps">NASA</span> is
collaborating with Google, <span class="caps">NOAA</span>, Zooinverse, the University of Deleware,
and others to capture unprecedented images of the reef and engage
citizen scientists to assist in the task of identifying and cataloguing
the diverse marine life in the&nbsp;region.</p>
<p>Citizens will be able to help by viewing high-resolution images of the
ocean floor and circling regions of coral, tagging information about its
appearance, and comparing it to any past images which might be available
to determine its growth (or destruction) over time. Additionally, during
<span class="caps">NEEMO</span> mission itself, Aquanauts will traverse over regions and supply
more detailed observations and imagery. <span class="caps">NASA</span> will use the data cataloged
by citizen scientists to help guide future mission time lines and
traverse paths toward the most scientifically rich regions of the reef.
If successful, this model of performing real science before and after
human missions can be duplicated for extraterrestrial&nbsp;destinations.</p>
<p>A community of \~400,000 citizen scientists will have an opportunity to
participate in the <span class="caps">NEEMO</span> Zooinverse Project via a website that will be
launched soon. The website will include real time mission engagement, as
well as a <span class="caps">DIY</span> “Guide to Participatory Undersea Exploration” that will
provide instructions on how you can map undersea terrain or how to build
your own undersea&nbsp;rover.</p>
