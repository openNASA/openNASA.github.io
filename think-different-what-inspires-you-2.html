</header>					<div class="article_content">
						<p>My inspiration for exploration started with the movie Space Camp. (<em>Stop
laughing</em>.) I watched it for the first time on vacation in Florida when
I was 10, and it immediately captured my imagination. Kids having fun
learning about space and finding themselves launched to orbit, because a
robot believed in a boy&#8230;. and along the way discovering what was in
them and accomplishing a mission no one believed&nbsp;possible.</p>
<p>It really is what <span class="caps">NASA</span> is about. Not the
accidentally-launching-kids-into-orbit part, but the “okay,
we-can-do-this” part. The focus that says it might not have gone like we
had expected, but we’ll find another way. The confidence that you might
be a Space Camper <em>today</em>, but if you study and work hard and stick with
your team, you might be landing Atlantis <em>tomorrow</em>.</p>
<p>It’s sadly easy to become uninspired, though - to allow the paperwork
and the deadlines and the meetings to pile up and deflate your passion,
to make you forget why you are here. So here are 7 things to remind you
about why we explore and why it matters, to help you think differently
about today so that our tomorrow will be different when we get&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><strong>#1: Fragile Oasis (fragileoasis.org) asks us “what kind of world do
you&nbsp;want?”</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYh6BD6-Hc8&amp;feature=share">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYh6BD6-Hc8&amp;feature=share</a></p>
<p>The vital question that changes everything. What kind of world do you
want? And what are <em>you</em> doing to shape it toward&nbsp;that?</p>
<p>If you haven’t asked yourself this question lately, you really&nbsp;should.</p>
<p><strong>#2: <span class="caps">STS</span>-135 Flight Director Tony Ceccacci’s post-landing handover
speech to Mission&nbsp;Control:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0jR8fqXdzg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0jR8fqXdzg</a></p>
<p>I thought I would cry when Atlantis landed, but I did okay until Tony
gave this little talk to the team. It’s so easy to get complacent, to
think that your job doesn’t matter, or that it isn’t going anywhere.
Often it feels like the agency is caught in the middle, and we forget
that pride of doing something incredibly special that very few other
organizations have ever accomplished. He reminds them that they are the
ones who have sent the crew to space and brought them back safely, and
they are the best in the world at&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>#3: The online petition to save the James Webb Space&nbsp;Telescope:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/do-not-cancel-funding-for-the-james-webb-space-telescope">http://www.change.org/petitions/do-not-cancel-funding-for-the-james-webb-space-telescope</a></p>
<p>I hope you’ve seen this, because I love it: people are engaging their
congressional leadership to try and save the next space telescope. There
are t-shirts and facebook groups and I even heard about attempts to
start a non-profit. I can’t help but believe that the amazing film
Hubble 3D helped with this, taught the public the incredible value of
this technology and what we can learn about ourselves from the universe
around us. This is the people&#8217;s space agency, and they are making their
voice heard about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>If you haven’t signed this yet, go do it right&nbsp;now.</p>
<p><strong>#4: Threadless creates a design challenge for the Final&nbsp;Frontier:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://atrium.threadless.com/nasa/submissions/">http://atrium.threadless.com/nasa/submissions/</a></p>
<p>Here’s a fun one to throw in with the serious. Threadless is an amazing
example of crowdsourcing design out to the&nbsp;public.</p>
<p>Wonder what the public view of exploration is? Go check it out and vote
for your&nbsp;favorite.</p>
<p><strong>#5: The plaque flown on Atlantis during <span class="caps">STS</span>-135:</strong></p>
<p>Commander Chris Ferguson concluded the <span class="caps">STS</span>-135 crew return ceremony with
the story of this little plaque that they left in the orbiter after the&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p><em><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>This plaque flew on the final Space Shuttle Mission in July, 2011.
From the fortunate few who have served in space to the thousands who
make spaceflight a reality, thank you for keeping the dream alive. Your
passion for these amazing space ships will always stand as proof of what
this country can do when it dares to be&nbsp;bold!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>That’s the charge right there from the commander of the final&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p>Do we dare to be bold? Are we going where the current takes us? or where
no other has gone&nbsp;before?</p>
<p><strong>#6: Popular Science petitions Congress to keep human spaceflight&nbsp;alive:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-07/nasa-manned-space-flight">http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2011-07/nasa-manned-space-flight</a></p>
<p>My favorite part is where author John Mahoney notes: &#8220;But the reason an
estimated one million people packed up their cars and RVs to drive to
the Space Coast for a space shuttle launch is because it is put on by
the people. Everyone who made that launch possible&#8212;in the truest
definition of a government employee, they&#8217;re our representatives in this
incredible project. We don&#8217;t just associate ourselves with them, we live
through them. That means something. They&#8217;ve devoted their life to this
very civil, very scientific cause&#8212;the exploration of outer&nbsp;space.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="caps">REAL</span> <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span>. I was privileged to watch the <span class="caps">STS</span>-135 launch with the <span class="caps">VIP</span>
guests of the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/topics/shuttle_station/index.html">Space Shuttle Program</a>. I sat in a room with dozens of
people who had worked on Shuttle for 25-30 years. Managers, technicians,
engineers, administrators. Their names might never be known but they
make this possible. I work with some of these real people who are
keeping the dream alive. My team that does the hard work of changing
policy, technology, and culture so that <span class="caps">NASA</span> is ready to meet the future
challenges. My friend leaving <span class="caps">NASA</span> for grad school in space policy so
that she can help the <span class="caps">NASA</span> of tomorrow be ready for the work it needs to&nbsp;do.</p>
<p>But I had to save the best for&nbsp;last.</p>
<p><strong>#7: Sawyer Rosenstein’s essay on BoingBoing “Don’t tell me the sky is
the limit when there are footprints on the
moon”:</strong> <a href="">http://boingboing.net/2011/07/26/don’t-tell-me-the-sky-is-the-limit-when-there-are-footprints-on-the-moon.html</a></p>
<p>Sawyer (@thenasaman) won’t let go of the dream, no matter what his
circumstances might tell him. He shows up. He asks questions about
<a href="http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/home/index.html">human spaceflight</a>. He didn’t like how the media talked about <span class="caps">NASA</span>?
He starts his own podcast and does something new. He supports <span class="caps">NASA</span> in
the thick and the thin, the popular, well-known missions&#8230; and the
not-so-popular. He doesn’t just think that space is cool - he believes
that the work <span class="caps">NASA</span> does might also one day enable him to walk&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>You’re my hero, Sawyer, and we’re in this thing together. If you aren’t
giving up, I’m not giving up&nbsp;either.</p>
<p><em>I kind of want to see those footprints on the moon&nbsp;myself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Where have you been inspired about exploration&nbsp;lately?</strong></p>
<p><strong>What have you done to inspire others? Let us&nbsp;know!</strong></p>
