						<p>The use of open source software, cloud computing technologies, and an
integrated approach to search, video, and social media seems almost
common-place in industry these days. Yet government websites aren’t
quite there with the exception of <a href="http://govfresh.com/2010/02/5-government-sites-using-drupal-effectively-for-open-government-initiatives/">a few noteable exceptions</a> (not an
exhaustive list by any means). This is why I’m so excited about that
<a href="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=150041"><span class="caps">NASA</span> has recently released an <span class="caps">RFI</span></a> (Request for Information) for
information on how to build a better public website nasa.gov and
intranet insdie.nasa.gov. This is <em>a really big step</em> for <span class="caps">NASA</span>, but,we
<strong>truly</strong> need your&nbsp;help.</p>
<p><strong>This is how it works.</strong> <span class="caps">NASA</span> has released an <span class="caps">RFI</span> and draft statement
of work. An <span class="caps">RFI</span>, or request for information, is a standard government
acquisition process in which vendors submit information that is then
used for comparative purposes to help <span class="caps">NASA</span> later release an <span class="caps">RFP</span>, or
request for proposal. An <span class="caps">RFI</span> helps <span class="caps">NASA</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct market research to identify what kinds of product or service
    solutions are commercially&nbsp;available</li>
<li>Ask industry to offer solutions for agency requirements or&nbsp;objectives</li>
<li>Collect information about relevant companies, their capabilities,
    products, and&nbsp;experience</li>
</ul>
<p>nasa.gov is a very high profile website with more around 600,000 unique
visitors and 43 million “hits” per day. The architecture itself is
massive, with roughly 140 disparate websites and web applications and
more total 700,000 web pages across 10 centers. It’s no small job and we
need someone who can help usher us into the future and develop a web
architecture appropriate for an agency like <span class="caps">NASA</span>. This is one of the
greatest jobs on Earth and we are looking to you to&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>If you are interested in helping us, the first step is simple. <a href="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=150041">Respond
to the <span class="caps">RFI</span></a>. We are looking for
companies and organizations that are visionary, that get open source,
cloud computing, and citizen engagement using the latest online&nbsp;technology.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the catch.</strong> You don’t have much time to respond. <span class="caps">RFI</span> responses
must be submitted <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>no later than 3:00
p.m. Eastern Standard Time on March 6, 2012</strong></span>! <a href="http://prod.nais.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eps/synopsis.cgi?acqid=150041">For all the
details check out the announcement here</a>.  <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/lukefretwell">Luke Fretwell</a> at <a href="http://fedscoop.com/nasa-moves-to-overhaul-web-operations/">FedScoop</a> also wrote a good article
summarizing the highlights and includes an embed of the main&nbsp;documents.</p>
