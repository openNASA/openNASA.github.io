						<p><em>Information overload?</em> How many accessible and scalable communication
techniques in social media can be utilized effectively to collaborate …
and in <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s case, push the frontier of space exploration? It&#8217;s now
been one week since we launched the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Google+ account and <span class="caps">NASA</span> has
seen an overwhelming positive response. Over the last few years, we have
been impressed with the rapid growth of <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s social media presence, so
we pulled the data for Facebook, Twitter, and Google+ at the 20,000
mark. It took #<span class="caps">NASA</span> 469 days to reach 20,000 followers on Twitter, 276
days on Facebook, and only 4 days on Google+. As of this morning,
between the three platforms, <span class="caps">NASA</span> has a combined reach of 2,264,854
(1,605,159 on twitter, 625,459 on Facebook, 34,236 on Google+). With
<span class="caps">NASA</span>’s almost 35,000 followers on Google+, <span class="caps">NASA</span> is <a href="http://socialstatistics.com/top/pages">the third most
popular non-Google page</a>.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more interesting than the number of followers on the Google+
platform, is how active the community has been. In the first week of
use, <span class="caps">NASA</span> posted 53 times to Google+. These posts generated 18,854 +1&#8217;s,
7,969 shares and 1996 comments. The most popular post was the time lapse
video from&nbsp;space.</p>
<p>There are a lot of possibilities for innovation through social media at
<span class="caps">NASA</span> and this level of activity on this new media platform confirms
there is still space to experiment and grow. In the next few weeks, <span class="caps">NASA</span>
will continue to share our amazing and iconic imagery, but we are also
planning on hosting hangouts with our scientists, engineers, and maybe
even Astronauts! Our first hangout will be on Monday November 21st at
3pm <span class="caps">ET</span> with our Open Government Initiative. We&#8217;ll be discussing Open
Source, Open Data and Social&nbsp;Media.</p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;d love to hear what ideas you have on how <span class="caps">NASA</span> uses social media
and invite you to share your thoughts here or on any of our <span class="caps">NASA</span> social
media&nbsp;platforms.</strong></p>
