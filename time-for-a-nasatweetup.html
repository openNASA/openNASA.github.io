						<p>A <span class="caps">NASA</span> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/index.html">Tweetup</a> is a special opportunity to give guests
behind-the-scenes access to <span class="caps">NASA</span> hardware and facilities. Participants
are generally chosen by lottery via an open web process and invited to a
<span class="caps">NASA</span> center to watch a launch, share an experience, or get an inside
look at what happens at a center. <span class="caps">NASA</span> tweetups are anywhere from
several hours to a few days and have included space shuttle launches,
science missions, <span class="caps">ISS</span> downlinks, mission control - just about every
aspect of spaceflight you can&nbsp;imagine.</p>
<p>As of August 2011, over 2,000 participants have been part of official
<span class="caps">NASA</span> Tweetups since the first event at <span class="caps">JPL</span> in January 2009. <span class="caps">NASA</span>, in an
attempt to measure the impact of one tweetup, tracked 10,665 tweets
originating from 150 participants in the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/tweetup_jpl_08-04-2011.html">Juno Tweetup</a> as well as the
subsequent retweets and found 29.9 million potential&nbsp;impressions.</p>
<p><strong>That&#8217;s a lot of outreach. </strong>I&#8217;ve participated in <span class="caps">NASA</span> Tweetups as a
<span class="caps">NASA</span> ambassador for events at my own center (<span class="caps">STS</span>-130, first <span class="caps">JSC</span> tweetup)
as well as a regular participant at another center. (<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/events/2011/SOFIA_tweetup.html"><span class="caps">SOFIA</span> at <span class="caps">NASA</span> Ames
Research Center</a>) Every time I have seen some of the best <span class="caps">NASA</span> has to&nbsp;offer.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s exciting about&nbsp;tweetups:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is social media as it is meant to function. <span class="caps">NASA</span> gets to tell
    their own story without a filter, listen and engage the public
    response, and interact directly with it. Tweetups also create
    community among often isolated followers, connecting them to <span class="caps">NASA</span>
    and to each other - and inspiring projects that aren&#8217;t sustained by
    <span class="caps">NASA</span> but by the community&nbsp;itself.</li>
<li>An extremely motivated, space-enthusiastic community who are ready
    to engage with <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s mission at a whole new level. It&#8217;s amazing to
    be in the company of people who sometimes have a wider knowledge of
    space history and trivia than many of us at <span class="caps">NASA</span>! I thought I was a
    space geek&#8230; but tweetups give a whole new definition to space&nbsp;geek!</li>
<li>The <span class="caps">NASA</span> Tweetup community (led by our friend <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/jonverve">Jon Verville</a>) has
    set up their own <a href="http://nasatweet.com/wiki/Main_Page">community wiki</a> to share their experiences and
    multiply their impact. They track each tweetup&#8217;s participants,
    schedule, media mentions, and mission references. The wiki also
    includes guides for first time attendeees as well as ways to [stay&nbsp;involved][].</li>
</ul>
<div>

Because here&#8217;s the reality: [citizen engagement][] means that we are
developing active evangelists and advocates for the space program - not
just passive spectators. When we encourage <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s scientists and
engineers to engage in real conversation with the public, it&#8217;s effective
*communication*. When they understand what and why <span class="caps">NASA</span> is doing, they
tend to share it with others - and this is creating *relevancy*. As <span class="caps">NASA</span>
becomes more relevant to people, it builds trust and finds more and more
advocates in the community who care about and want to contribute to the
exploration vision, and this is *inspiration*. And it just keeps going
from there&#8230;

for a great story by <span class="caps">JPL</span>&#8217;s [Veronica McGregor][] about the @MarsPhoenix
story.

Another great story: one tweetup was cut short by some [on-orbit
