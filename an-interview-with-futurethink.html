						<p>I had the opportunity to talk to <a href="http://futurethink.com/">futurethink</a> about <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Open
Innovation Program. This is a cross-post of the <a href="http://futurethink.com/innovator-interview-nasas-nick-skytland/">interview</a> from their
website.   A longer version of this interview will be published (and
linked here) in a few&nbsp;days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1) How does a large organization like <span class="caps">NASA</span> manage its innovation
process? (And more specifically, the Open <span class="caps">NASA</span>&nbsp;initiative?)</strong></p>
<p>For the last century, we have relied on governments to tackle the
grand challenges of our time and to manage the innovation process
within government by themselves. For the average citizen,
participating in government was extremely limited – you could show up
to vote on election day, express your concern by protesting about a
cause, or if you really wanted to make a change, apply for a
government&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>Most people had very little influence on how business in government
was conducted and how innovation was managed (if it was managed at
all). This severely limited not only the number of people working on
solving our nation’s toughest challenges, but also limited the
diversity in perspective contributed towards the&nbsp;solutions.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we have witnessed the emergence of technology
that is slowly starting to change the way governments approach
innovation and opening up new ways to participate directly in
government. At <span class="caps">NASA</span>, we are just beginning to rethink what this means
for how we manage our innovation process. We are starting to embrace
openness as a catalyst to innovation and providing unprecedented
access to our raw data, software and technology to a wide base of
potential contributors. We are also starting to shift away from purely
competitive approaches and also embrace new paradigm shifting&nbsp;collaboration.</p>
<p>Because of this shift, we are starting to enable breakthroughs to
proceed at a faster rate than was possible before. We work with others
to show how they can leverage distributed collaboration to focus the
investment of thousands of individual effort hours by citizens across
the country towards constructive projects that benefit both <span class="caps">NASA</span> and
the&nbsp;nation.</p>
<p><strong>2) How do you select which ideas to invest in and move forward&nbsp;with?</strong></p>
<p>Government agencies must find groups of people, bring them together
around an issue or problem that needs to be fixed, then step out of
the way and let the collective energy of the people involved solve
problems in creative and imaginative ways that we would never have
done ourselves. It’s not just about individual participation; it’s
about mass collaboration. It’s about creating platforms that allow us
to take advantage of the exponential power of what happens when a
thousand eyes look at our toughest problems and we collectively
develop a&nbsp;solution.</p>
<p>The key to this is to build a platform for collaboration that doesn’t
prescribe our own solution and then rewards the best ideas with the
recognition they deserve. Our approach within the Open Innovation
Program has been to identify and prioritize the challenges most worth
solving, build a platform to engage a large diverse group of
participants around the challenge, incentivize them (through
collaboration) to develop a solution, and then let the best ideas rise
to the top&nbsp;naturally.</p>
<p><strong>3) What are some collaborations the program has facilitated that
have led to new ideas and&nbsp;solutions?</strong></p>
<p>An amazing collaboration that has come out of our work that has led to
new ideas and solutions is the <a href="http://www.rhok.org">Random Hacks of Kindness</a> project.
Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK) is a rapidly growing global initiative
encompassing a core team of collaborators including <a href="http://www.nasa.gov"><span class="caps">NASA</span></a>, <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">World
Bank</a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> and <a href="http://www.hp.com/"><span class="caps">HP</span></a>, an ever
expanding ecosystem of supporting organizations, and a community of
over 5,500 innovators in over 30 countries collectively working to
make the world a better&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Based on our experience with Random Hacks of Kindness, we developed
the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">International Space Apps Challenge</a> which is an international
mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over
48-hours in cities around the world. In April of 2012, we hosted the
first International Space Apps Challenge. The event embraces
collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant
open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life
on Earth and life in space. The event took place in 25 countries
around the world and resulted in over 100 solutions. It was the
largest government-led mass collaboration event to date, and a
testament to what people can accomplish together if given the
permission, opportunity, and&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>The event demonstrated that the creativity and innovation that used to
take place primarily behind closed doors within large institutions is
increasingly taking place by people connected together online. By
tapping into a global community of expertise, partnering with leading
researchers, scientists, technologists, academics and entrepreneurs as
well as collaborating directly with citizens and innovative
organizations on projects like Random Hacks of Kindness and the
International Space Apps Challenge, we are able to develop solutions
that we would have never came up with on our own. Solutions that may
have a lasting impacts on both <span class="caps">NASA</span> and the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><strong>3) What is the single biggest challenge to making innovation happen
at <span class="caps">NASA</span>? (And how do you overcome&nbsp;them?)</strong></p>
<p>The single biggest challenge to making innovation happen at <span class="caps">NASA</span> is
simply “<em>culture</em>.” If you want to see how innovative an organization
truly is (not just how people perceive it to be), simply take a good
hard look at its culture. To move beyond this, we must challenge
long-standing business management orthodoxies – even the cultural&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p>The grand challenges today are too complex – the ones worth solving
will require all of us. But changing the culture of an entire
organization as big as <span class="caps">NASA</span> seems like a nearly impossible task at
first, so you have to lead by example and start small. Innovation is
all about challenging prevailing assumptions about the way we have
done things in the past and suggesting better approaches. It’s about
staying nimble by minimizing&nbsp;complexity.</p>
<p><strong>5) What is your favorite innovation that has come out of the Open
Innovation&nbsp;Program?</strong></p>
<p>My favorite example is that of the <a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/nasa-planetary-data-system-interface/solution/120"><span class="caps">VICAR2PNG</span></a> project which helped
unlock some valuable <span class="caps">NASA</span> data. <span class="caps">NASA</span> really has an unparalleled trove
of scientific and engineering data that represents an incredible asset
that we want the public to utilize. At the <a href="http://2012.spaceappschallenge.org/">2012 International Space
Apps Challenge</a>, we offered a challenge to improve access to <span class="caps">NASA</span>
data. As it turns out, much of the image data from <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s missions in
the Planetary Image Atlas was in an very outdated <span class="caps">VICAR</span> format. As the
developers soon found out, <span class="caps">VICAR</span> was unreadable by any existing open
source image conversion tools, so they set out to create one! They
wrote and packaged a solution called “vicar2png” so that anyone can
view, enjoy, and remix <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s mission image data easily by converting
<span class="caps">VICAR</span> files to the popular <span class="caps">PNG</span> image format. To demonstrate the
potential of the solution (and the data), they then created movies
using PNGs from several segments of raw images from the
Cassini-Huygens mission. The solution showcased the potential of
what’s possible by making <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s data more&nbsp;accessible.</p>
