						<p>This weekend, more then 9,000 people and 484 organizations from around
the world came together in 83 cities across 44 countries, as well as
online, to engage directly with <span class="caps">NASA</span> at the <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2013/04/19/worlds-largest-hackathon/">largest hackathon ever
held</a>. In just 83 total hours, we collectively tackled the <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/">58
challenges</a> by developing awe-inspiring software, buiding jaw-dropping
hardware, and creating stunning data visualizations that together
resulted in one giant leap towards improving life on Earth and life in
space. After the dust settled, an impressive <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org/projects/">750+ solutions</a> were&nbsp;submitted.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://spaceappschallenge.org">International Space Apps Challenge</a> was the culmination of months
of planning, years of experimentation and thousands and thousands of
hours of hard work from people across the globe who share in the
excitement of building our collective future. It is a shining example
that transparency, participation and collaboration are alive and well at
<span class="caps">NASA</span>. This event could not have been possible without&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>Our space program, more then ever, requires the active engagement of the
public to co-create our future. This weekend demonstrated the true
potential of participatory exploration and what can happen when a
government agency like <span class="caps">NASA</span> takes a chance on engaging the untapped,
unexpected, and uncharted know-how of thousands of passionate citizens
around the&nbsp;world.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">THANK</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span> for participating in the International Space Apps&nbsp;Challenge.</strong></p>
<p>With huge&nbsp;respect,</p>
<p>Nick, Ali, Chris, Sean and the Space Apps&nbsp;team</p>
