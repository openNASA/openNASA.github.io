						<p><em>This post by <a href="http://fragileoasis.org/community/Astro_Ron/">Ron Garan</a> and the Collaboration Project team is one
amazing way <span class="caps">NASA</span> is partnering with innovators and world-changers to
take the perspective, insight, and technology we have from space and
make the world a better, safer, more beautiful&nbsp;place. </em></p>
<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/TgoxQDVKRIY" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe>

<p>For thousands of years of human history, the vast majority of people in
the world believed that it was impossible to fly to the Moon - simply
because it had never been done before. Up until about 50 years ago
people would have thought you were crazy to suggest we could go to the
Moon, but human ingenuity and the determination of the human spirit
proved that it was possible. Today, many people believe that it is
impossible to solve the problems of the world. It is widely believed
that is impossible to lift the poor out of poverty. ‘There have always
been poor in the world and there always will be,’ they say. If we can
land on the Moon and return to Earth safely, if nations can join
together and build an enormous research facility in orbit, we can, by
working together, solve many of the challenges facing our planet
including the alleviation of poverty. <strong>Nothing is&nbsp;impossible.</strong></p>
<p>When we look at the Earth from space we are faced with a sobering
contradiction. On one hand, we can clearly see the indescribable beauty
of the planet we have been given; on the other hand, is the unfortunate
reality of life for a significant number of our beautiful planet’s&nbsp;inhabitants.</p>
<p>When astronauts reflect on how peaceful, beautiful, and fragile the
Earth looks from space, these reflections are not clichés that
astronauts say because they feel good. <em>It is truly moving to look at
the Earth from space.</em> <em>We can look down at a particular part of the
Earth and feel empathy for the struggles that all people face. We can
look down with an orbital perspective and realize that we are all riding
through the Universe together on this spaceship we call Earth, that we
are all interconnected, that we are all in this together, that we are
all family. This is what we call the “Orbital&nbsp;Perspective.”</em></p>
<p>It saddens us and compels us to action when we realize that we have the
resources and technology to overcome almost all of the challenges facing
our planet, yet nearly a billion people do not have access to clean
water, countless go to bed hungry every night, and many die from
preventable and curable&nbsp;diseases.</p>
<p>We believe that we live in a world where the possibilities are limited
only by our imagination and our will to act. It is within our power to
eliminate the suffering and poverty that exist on our&nbsp;planet.</p>
<p>The answer is quite simple - <strong>just do something.</strong> The challenges of
the world are really about how each of us individually responds to them.
In other words, to what extent does humanity, on a person-to-person
basis, commit to making a positive difference, no matter how small or
how&nbsp;big?</p>
<p>The good news is there are over 20 million organizations around the
world working to improve life on our planet where people can lend a&nbsp;hand.</p>
<p>The bad news is, for the most part, these organization are not engaged
in a unified coordinated effort. There is a great deal of duplication of
effort and loss of&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>So what are we trying to&nbsp;do?</strong></p>
<p>To illustrate the problem, let’s take a look at Felipe. Felipe has a
calling to make a difference in the world. Let’s say he wants to help
provide clean water to those who need it. Maybe Felipe wants to work
with an organization providing clean water or maybe he wants to donate
money to one of these many efforts. Felipe will find that there are
thousands of organizations dedicated to solving the global water crisis.
There is also a myriad of different technologies and different opinions
on how to best solve the problem. Felipe will spend countless hours
trying to find and sort through all the information on the subject.
After all that work he will not find a definitive, impartial, logical,
user-friendly listing of all his&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>Now let’s consider Celine. Celine founded an organization dedicated to
providing clean water. Celine’s organization is presently working in
country X and has run into problem Y. Celine does not realize that
another organization has already solved the problem she faces and the
current path that her organization is traveling down will lead to a dead
end. She doesn’t realize that there are other organizations out there
that have the pieces of the puzzle that she&nbsp;needs.</p>
<p>Lastly, let’s see about Maria. Maria lives in a village where people are
frequently ill due to the poor quality of the water in her village and
many die every year. Maria wants to help her village. Maria doesn’t
realize that there is an organization that is presently looking for
water projects to accomplish in her area and this organization is
presently unaware of the situation in her&nbsp;village.</p>
<p>Although these are hypothetical situations they accurately represent the
extremely disorganized state of humanitarian&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>One of Ron’s personal objectives on his recent mission was to use the
orbital perspective to inspire people to go out and make a difference to
go out and make the world a better place. To that end, we created a
project called <a href="http://fragileoasis.org/">Fragile Oasis</a>. The vision for Fragile Oasis is to be
a vehicle to affect real change. Our idea was to pair systems on a
spacecraft designed to support life (provide clean water, air, energy,
health, etc.) to systems (or projects) on our spaceship Earth designed
to provide the same thing. By providing a means for people and
organizations in each of these categories to collaborate and develop
synergy toward overcoming our planet’s challenges, we help these
organizations that are striving to make the world a better place and
reach their&nbsp;goals.</p>
<p>Since there are multiple organizations looking for effective ways to
collaborate and synergize, it is critical to unify efforts to establish
an effective collaboration mechanism for people and organizations to
solve the challenges facing our world. By first bringing together those
organizations that are striving to pair challenges with solutions we
will be bringing together different unique pieces of the&nbsp;puzzle.</p>
<p>The goal of this collaboration is to bring together different
perspectives to create one, simple, user-friendly mechanism to
communicate and collaborate to tackle the challenges facing our world.
By doing that we can all learn from each others’ successes and&nbsp;mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge for&nbsp;RHoK:</strong></p>
<p>What better way to hack for humanity than to create an effective
collaboration mechanism for people and organizations to solve the
challenges facing the world. We need help to launch a collaboration
platform, using data visualization and social networking resources to
represent challenges facing our planet and progress towards their
solutions, including the <span class="caps">UN</span> Millennial Development&nbsp;Goals.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to reduce that sobering contradiction that we see
when we look at the Earth: that it is not only visibly beautiful, but a
place where life is beautiful for&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>Specifically, we challenge the RHoK community&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build a robust, user-friendly database of projects worldwide that is
    easily accessed with all&nbsp;metadata</li>
<li>Add map visualization and organization&nbsp;functionality</li>
<li>Add creative communication and chat capabilities that will allow
    everyone to connect and change the world&nbsp;together.</li>
</ul>
<p>See our problem statements at <a href="http://www.rhok.org/node/18701">http://www.rhok.org/node/18701</a> and
<a href="http://www.rhok.org/problems/catalyst-map">http://www.rhok.org/problems/catalyst-map</a> for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>We have a number of partners who have already contributed pieces to the
puzzle, including:<br />
<a href="http://fragileoasis.org/">Fragile Oasis</a><br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwSzDZnNjUk">Coalition of the Willing</a><br />

<a href="http://www.umovement.org/">UMovement</a><br />
<a href="http://www.usaid.gov/"><span class="caps">USAID</span></a></p>
<p>We envision that the overall solution&nbsp;would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be single&nbsp;source.</li>
<li>Not take a “one site to rule them all”&nbsp;paradigm.</li>
<li>Not compete with existing collaboration/networking systems. We want
    to create a system that all humanitarian organizations can use to
    enhance their matching service on their own&nbsp;sites.</li>
<li>Allow people to scan data visualizations of the problems and
    challenges these different organizations are addressing, and also of
    the real or potential impact (determined using standardized&nbsp;metrics)</li>
<li>Be helpful to people using individual organization’s sites. It
    wouldn&#8217;t replace the individual sites – it would complement&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>Offer for people and orgs to install widgets on their sites and
    access the data through the widget on their own&nbsp;site.</li>
<li>Be Open&nbsp;Source.</li>
<li>Be&nbsp;user-friendly.</li>
<li>Be standardized and universally&nbsp;accepted.</li>
<li>Be&nbsp;apolitical.</li>
<li>Be&nbsp;accurate.</li>
<li>Be able to feed data to any&nbsp;site.</li>
<li>The end product should be transparent to end&nbsp;users.</li>
<li>Have robust social networking&nbsp;features.</li>
<li>Have enhanced search&nbsp;tools.</li>
<li>Allow users to participate in Facebook style&nbsp;chat.</li>
<li>Be self sufficient and financially&nbsp;sustainable.</li>
</ul>
