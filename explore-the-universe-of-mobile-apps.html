						<p>Mobile apps have become a regular part of my daily life. It’s safe to
say there are enough apps to perform virtually any task you have in
mind! I find apps to be a great tool to keep me in touch with friends,
daily news, and <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<p>The flagship app for <span class="caps">NASA</span> is of course the &#8220;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/iphone/index.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> App</a>&#8220;, which is

over 9.9 million times and recently averaged over 2.5 million hits per
day.  However, <span class="caps">NASA</span> has made a wide variety of interactive apps for
mobile users, which range from performing a spacewalk to receiving a
notification every time the <span class="caps">ISS</span> is right above you. These apps give you
an opportunity to stay involved and educated on current and future <span class="caps">NASA</span>
missions.  Listed below are all 41 of the <span class="caps">NASA</span>-related apps for iOS and&nbsp;Android!</p>
<p>Click away and download as many as you&nbsp;can.</p>

</a>By: Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br />
The app was designed to give an overview of the spacecraft’s current
activities, starting with the latest dramatic images. These images range
from sublime insights into another ‘set of worlds,’ considering the moon
Titan itself has been called the most earth-like body in our solar
system. Also included in the app is the ‘Present Position’ of the
spacecraft, as well as a countdown to the next major event – usually a
spectacular targeted flyby of one of Saturn’s moons. More in-depth
information is only a click&nbsp;away.</p>
<p>​6. [Comet Quest<br />
][]By: Jet Propulsion Laboratory<br />
The Rosetta spacecraft approaches Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Using its thrusters, Rosetta goes into orbit around the comet nucleus.
Now you, the player, get to take over the spacecraft in its mission to
learn about the mysterious comet. First, you must drop a lander on the
nucleus. To land it in an optimum location, your timing must be&nbsp;excellent!</p>

<span class="caps">NASA</span>’s <span class="caps">GRAIL</span> mission is comprised of a pair of mirror-identical
spacecraft to the Earths Moon to perform precision gravity measurements.
The gravity field will allow scientists to determine the structure of
the Moon’s interior from the surface to the deep interior, advance our
understanding of the thermal evolution of the Moon and our understanding
of how other rocky planets in the solar system are formed. The voyage to
the moon will take approximately 5 months at which point the two
spacecraft will enter precision formation orbit ranging from 50km to
200km above the moons surface. Later versions of the app will include
images captured by&nbsp;MoonKAM.</p>

<p><strong>Now *this* is living in the 21st&nbsp;Century!</strong></p>
<p>It’s amazing to see all the apps that are related to <span class="caps">NASA</span> and space, all
compressed into one list. As a space lover, I like the apps that feature
neat pictures from space or interactive simulations, which tends to be a
theme for most of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>From the list above we can say that (so far) 74% of the apps are iOS and
26% are Android. Although Android continues to grow iOS stands firm and
dominates the <span class="caps">NASA</span> application list! Find the apps that most interest
you, and spark your interest in science and space through them! They&#8217;re
only a <em>touch</em>&nbsp;away.</p>
