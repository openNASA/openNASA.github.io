						<p>Yesterday, <span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="caps">JPL</span> released <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spacecraft-3d/id541089908?mt=8" title="Spacecraft 3D - iTunes">Spacecraft 3D</a>, an augmented reality
application for the iPhone and iPad that allows you to create a 3D
version of either Curiosity, the Mars rover current en-route to the Red
Planet, or the <span class="caps">GRAIL</span> spacecraft, currently orbiting the moon. Although
it may sound simple, the technology behind making the models appear on
your device is actually fairly advanced. It works like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ol>
<li>You print out a special <span class="caps">PDF</span> (the app will email it to you) that has
    a particular pattern printed on it. This pattern allows your device
    to align and orient itself and figure out how to position the&nbsp;model.</li>
<li>Once your device has a lock on the pattern, sensors inside (such as
    the accelerometer) along with tracking of the pattern allow your
    device to move the model in relation to how your device moves,
    enabling you to pan around and zoom in on the&nbsp;model.</li>
</ol>
<p>I had a lot of fun playing around with the app at my desk today. Here&#8217;s
a picture of <span class="caps">GRAIL</span> hanging off the side of my&nbsp;wall:</p>
<p>[<img alt="GRAIL Spacecraft on the wall of my office" src="http://open.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/grailonwall.jpg" title="GRAIL on Wall" />][]</p>
<p>You can also make the models move and interact - for example, Curiosity
will rotate around and extend its robotic&nbsp;arm.</p>
<p>Spacecraft 3D is a great demonstration of augmented reality technology
and some of the potentials it has for work at <span class="caps">NASA</span> and in the world.
Imagine using similar technology to project images on the helmets of
astronauts on spacewalks to help them locate and move components. With
the increases in computing power that we are seeing today, augmented
reality will quickly become feasible for the masses and technologies
like Google&#8217;s <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/111626127367496192147/posts" title="Google Project Glass">Project Glass</a> will become ubiquitous. Think of the&nbsp;possibilities!</p>
<p>Spacecraft 3D is currently available for iPhone and iPad and will be
coming to other platforms&nbsp;soon.</p>
