						<p>I&#8217;m currently working on creating a website that needs <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s logo (the
&#8220;meatball&#8221; &#8212; don&#8217;t ask) in the upper corner. With the upcoming swarm of
resolution independence due to high <span class="caps">DPI</span> screens and a multitude of
screen resolutions, just including a standard <span class="caps">JPG</span> or <span class="caps">PNG</span> image just
doesn&#8217;t cut it anymore. <span class="caps">SVG</span> icons allow you to include an image that
scales as big or small as you need it, without any loss in image quality
(and often smaller than a comparable image in <span class="caps">PNG</span> or <span class="caps">JPG</span>).</p>
<p>After doing some research on <span class="caps">SVG</span> images on the web, I came across <a href="https://github.com/adamfairhead/webicons" title="FC Webicons"><span class="caps">FC</span>
Webicons</a>, a set of social media icons presented in <span class="caps">SVG</span> with <span class="caps">PNG</span>
fallbacks for older browsers that don&#8217;t support <span class="caps">SVG</span> images. As that code
is open source, I adopted it to present <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s logo in a futuristic,
resolution independent way&#8230;but decided, hey, it was so much fun, why
stop&nbsp;there?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to introduce today <a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Gov-Webicons" title="Gov Webicons">Gov Webicons</a>, a set of 41 federal
agency icons that you can use on your website with just two lines of
code. Creating a dashboard of agencies? Include them all. Want to just
update your own agency&#8217;s icon? Take out just the code and images you
need and have fun living in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Gov-Webicons" title="Gov Webicons">Gov Webicons</a> is open source and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/seanherron/Gov-Webicons" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>. I&#8217;d love to
include additional federal agencies and can do so as long as there is a
publicly available <span class="caps">SVG</span> version of their graphic online. Any tips on
improving Gov Webicons or ideas for more agencies to add? Drop me a line
in the comments below, I&#8217;d love to hear your&nbsp;thoughts!</p>
