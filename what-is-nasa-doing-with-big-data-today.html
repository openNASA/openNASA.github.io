						<p>In the time it took you to read this sentence, <span class="caps">NASA</span> gathered
<em>approximately</em> 1.73 gigabytes of data from our nearly 100 currently
active missions! We do this every hour, every day, every year - and the
collection rate is growing exponentially. Handling, storing, and
managing this data is a massive challenge. Our data is one of our most
valuable assets, and its strategic importance in our research and
science is huge. We are committed to making our data as accessible as
possible, both for the benefit of our work and for the betterment of
humankind through the innovation and creativity of the over seven
billion other people on this planet who don’t work at <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</p>
<p>In version 2.0 of our <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan">Open Government Plan</a>, we scratched the surface
in terms of the work that the Agency is involved in around &#8220;<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-data/">big
data</a>” but there is much more to&nbsp;explore.</p>
<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in a panel hosted by <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-big-data-debunked-live-stream-7000005052/"><span class="caps">CBS</span>
TechLines</a> called &#8220;<em>Big Data Debunked &#8212; Finding the Data Signals.</em>&#8221; I
was joined by <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-fords-michael-cavaretta-on-internal-big-data-7000004000/">Michael Cavaretta</a> of Ford, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-archimedes-katrina-montinola-7000004449/">Katrina Montinola</a> of
Archimedes, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-t-mobiles-christine-twiford-7000004728/">Christine Twiford</a> of T-Mobile, <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/techlines-panelist-profile-ibms-james-kobielus-on-big-data-talent-7000005003/">James Kobielus</a> of <span class="caps">IBM</span>
and ZDNet editor-in-chief <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/us/larry.dignan/">Larry Dignan</a>. We discussed the challenges
and opportunities big data poses for organizations today. I was humbled
by their vision and so inspired by the examples that they shared, that I
wanted to share more about what <span class="caps">NASA</span> is&nbsp;doing.</p>
<p><strong>What is Big&nbsp;Data?</strong></p>
<p>The whole idea of big data is still relatively new and most discussions
or presentations around the subject start off with a definition of what
big data really is. Definitions are certainly helpful, especially when
the topic is still relatively new, and so we&#8217;ll start there oursevles.
Big data is very simply a collection of data sets so large and complex
that your legacy <span class="caps">IT</span> systems can not handle them. When organizations get
to the point where their <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/events/event_summ.jsp?cntn_id=124058&amp;org=CISE">volume, velocity, variety</a> and veracity of
data exceed storage or computing capacity, there are some big challenges
that need to be addressed. You know you have a big data challenge when
your traditional data management systems and analysis tools are
overwhelmed and it becomes difficult to process your data using the
analytic or visualization tools you currently have. Approaching the big
data challenge often necessitates advanced algorithms, infrastructure
and frameworks - and it can all seem very daunting for those just
starting out - but the reality for information-age-based organizations
is that our success is throttled by our our ability to rapidly and
comprehensively navigate the big data&nbsp;universe.</p>
<p>But of course, big data is relative.  In the end, big data by itself has
no value - it&#8217;s meaningless. It&#8217;s what you do with the data that matters
most. Today&#8217;s big data discussion is often centered around how to target
advertisements or customize a user experience, which makes sense given
that the growth in the market place is so closely tied to fact that how
we interact with the physical world is more and more dependent on the
pervasive use of mobile devices that are connect to the work through
sensors. Having the ability to leverage our rich history of data and
combine it with new data we are receiving is a huge asset in making our
missions&nbsp;successful.</p>
<p>If you are still trying to wrap your head around the difference between
petabytes, exabytes, zetabytes, and yottabytes, check out this
overview <a href="http://prezi.com/pupffr4ujwqa/what-is-big-data-and-why-does-it-matter-scsim/?auth_key=28ac73cbc9454fc3f1880bc60f328b48351a0000">presentation</a> titled <em>&#8220;What is Big Data and why does it
matter&#8221;</em> by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tom-soderstrom/4/100/a99">Tom Soderstrom</a>, the Chief Technology Officer for <span class="caps">IT</span> at
<span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="caps">JPL</span>.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Big Data&nbsp;Challenge</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s big data challenge is not just a terrestrial one and it goes
beyond the stereotypical challenge. Many of our “big data” sets are
described by significant metadata, but on a scale that challenges
current and future data management practice. We regularly engage in
missions where data is continually streaming from spacecraft on Earth
and in space, faster than we can store, manage, and interpret it. <span class="caps">NASA</span>
has two very different types of spacecraft. We have deep space
spacecraft that sends back data in the order of <span class="caps">MB</span>/s. Then we have earth
orbiters that can send back data in <span class="caps">GB</span>/s per second. In our current
missions, data is transferred with radio frequency, which is relatively
slow. In the future, <span class="caps">NASA</span> will employ technology such as optical (laser)
communication to increase the download and mean a 1000x increase in the
volume of data. This is much more then we can handle today and this is
what we are starting to prepare for now. We are planning missions today
that will easily stream more then <span class="caps">24TB</span>&#8217;s a day.  That’s roughly 2.4
times the entire Library of Congress - <span class="caps">EVERY</span> <span class="caps">DAY</span>. For one&nbsp;mission.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still very expensive to transfer just one bit down from a
spacecraft so we want to make sure we collect what is most important.
Once the data makes its way to our data centers, storing, managing,
visualizing and analyzing it becomes an issue. To give you an idea of
what we are dealing with, the size of the Climate Change data
repositories alone are projected to grow to nearly 350 Petabytes by
2030.  5 <span class="caps">PB</span>&#8217;s is equivalent to the total number of letters delivered by
the <span class="caps">US</span> Postal Service in one&nbsp;year!</p>
<p>One great example of the unique challenge that we face with managing
space data is just starting to be demonstrated by the <a href="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/projects/mira/">Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (<span class="caps">ASKAP</span>)</a> project which is a large array
made up of 36 antennas, each 12 meters in diameter, spread out over
4,000 square meters but working together as a single instrument to
unlock the mysteries of our universe. The array, which will officially
be turned on and open for business tomorrow Friday, October 5, 2012, is
able to survey the whole sky very quickly and offers an ability to
perform research that could never have been done before.   Check out
this great <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=FDoDk4D2RAw#!">time lapse video</a> showing off the new telescopes
capabilities!  The array is a precursor for the larger <a href="http://www.skatelescope.org/">Square Kilometre
Array</a> telescope that will open in 2016 and will combine the signals
received from thousands of small antennas spread over a distance of more
than 3000 km. When operational, as much as <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Hadoop_Summit/big-data-challenges-at-nasa"><span class="caps">700TB</span>/second of data</a> will
flow from the Square Kilometre Array! This is a big data&nbsp;challenge.</p>
<p>And of course, spacecraft are not the only source of our data, thanks to
an ever-growing supply of mobile devices, low-cost sensors, and online
platforms. As an article in <a href="http://hbr.org/2012/10/big-data-the-management-revolution/ar/1">Harvard Business Review</a> this month put
it, &#8220;<em>each of us is now a walking data generator</em>.&#8221; The scale of the big
data challenge for <span class="caps">NASA</span>, like many organizations, is&nbsp;daunting.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, the increasing data volumes are not our
only challenges. As our wealth of data increases, the challenge of
indexing, searching, transferring, and so on all increase exponentially
as well. Additionally, the increasing complexity of instruments and
algorithms, increasing rate of technology refresh, and the decreasing
budget environment, all play a significant factor in our approach.
Fortunately, the entire federal government has turned their attention
towards the growing challenge. In March 2012, the Obama administration
announced the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/big_data_press_release_final_2.pdf">Big Data Research and Development Initiative</a> to
“<em>greatly improve the tools and techniques needed to access, organize,
and glean discoveries from huge volumes of digital data</em>.&#8221; The goal is
to transform government&#8217;s ability to use big data for scientific
discovery, environmental and biomedical research, education, and
national&nbsp;security.</p>
<p><strong>Current&nbsp;Approaches</strong></p>
<p>Developing new approaches to understanding, analyzing, and visualizing
the data we have en masse is of vital interest to <span class="caps">NASA</span>. Within
government, there is a push to get ahead of big data from both the top
down and bottom up. We outlined many of the big data activities and
approaches from the perspective of the Mission Directorates
(<a href="http://science.nasa.gov/">Science</a>, <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/index.html">Human Space Exploration and Operations</a>,
<a href="http://www.aeronautics.nasa.gov/">Aeronautics</a>, and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/home/index.html">Technology</a>) in Version 2.0 of the <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Open
Government Plan</a>. Below are six world-class
examples of how we manage, store, archive, analyze, visualize, and apply
our big data&nbsp;efforts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Managing and&nbsp;Processing</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s approach to managing and processing data is demonstrated by the
<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/government/information-management/nasa-makes-most-of-curiosity-rover-data/240007311">Mission Data Processing and Control System (<span class="caps">MPCS</span>)</a> which was
recently used by the Curiosity rover on Mars. <span class="caps">MPCS</span> interfaces with
<span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s deep-space network, and in turn the Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter, to relay data to and from Curiosity and process the raw data
in real time, a process which previously took hours if not days to
accomplish. The system produces custom data visualizations that are
used by the flight operations&nbsp;team.</p>
<p><strong>Storage</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nccs.nasa.gov/"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Center for Climate Simulation (<span class="caps">NCCS</span>)</a>, which is primarily
used by <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office and the Goddard
Institute for Space Studies, demonstrates the Agency&#8217;s approach to
storing big data. The <span class="caps">NCCS</span> focuses on climate and weather data and
currently houses 32 petabytes of data, with a total capacity of 37
petabytes (<a href="http://www.csc.com/cscworld/publications/81769/81773-supercomputing_the_climate_nasa_s_big_data_mission">source</a>). The center also has advanced visualization
tools, such as it&#8217;s 17-by-6-foot visualization wall which allows for
one high-resolution surface on which scientists can display still
images, video and animated content from data housed in the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p><strong>Archiving and&nbsp;Distribution</strong></p>
<p>Two examples of how <span class="caps">NASA</span> approaches processing and archiving are
demonstrated by the <a href="http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/">Atmospheric Science Data Center (<span class="caps">ASDC</span>)</a>, which
is focused on Earth science, and the <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/">Planetary Data System (<span class="caps">PDS</span>)</a>,
which is focused on planetary science. The Atmospheric Science Data
Center at <span class="caps">NASA</span> Langley Research Center is responsible for processing,
archiving, and distribution of <span class="caps">NASA</span> Earth science data. It specializes
in atmospheric data important to understanding the causes and
processes of global climate change and the consequences of human
activities on the climate and includes petabytes of climate data
collected over decades. The Planetary Data Systems archives and
distributes scientific data into one website from <span class="caps">NASA</span> planetary
missions, astronomical observations, and laboratory measurements. It
offers access to over 100 <span class="caps">TB</span> of space images, telemetry, models, and
anything else associated with planetary missions from the past 30&nbsp;years.</p>
<p><strong>Analysis</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s <a href="http://wiki.esipfed.org/images/8/89/Cloud_Computing_Talk_by_Adrian_Gartner.pdf">Pleiades</a> supercomputer is used to help analyze the
challenging projects, from solar flare and space weather scenarios to
detailed space vehicle designs. Pleiades was recently used to process
massive amounts of star data gathered from <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Kepler spacecraft,
leading to the discovery of new Earth-sized planets in the Milky Way
galaxy. More than 1,200 users across the country rely on the system to
perform large, complex calculations. It was also used to generate the
Bolshoi cosmological simulation which explores how galaxies and the
large-scale structure of the universe has formed over billions of&nbsp;years.</p>
<p><strong>Visualization</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://c3.nasa.gov/nex/"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Earth Exchange (<span class="caps">NEX</span>)</a> is a virtual laboratory that
integrates supercomputer, data system, data visualization, large
amount of online data, models and algorithms, with social network and
collaborative technology.  Prior to <span class="caps">NEX</span>, scientists were required to
invest tremendous amounts of time and effort to develop high-end
computational methods rather than focus on important scientific
problems. Now, scientists can use the supercomputer to visualize large
Earth science data sets as well as run and share modeling algorithms
and collaborate on new or existing projects. Recently, a research team
from around the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> used the <span class="caps">NEX</span> environment to adjoin an
atmospherically correct mosaic of 9,000 Landsat Thematic Mapper scenes
and retrieve global vegetation density at a 30- meter resolution. The
entire processing of the nearly 340 billion pixels in the the
composite took just a few hours on the Pleiades supercomputer,
allowing the team to experiment with new algorithms and approaches
with ease. We’ve also invested in a number of collaboration and
knowledge-sharing platform for the Earth science community that
combine supercomputing, Earth system modeling, workflow management and
<span class="caps">NASA</span> remote sensing data feeds to enable a holistic view of our work
for researchers. <a href="http://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/is/upload/NIST-Big-Data-06132012.pdf">More information on <span class="caps">NEX</span>.</a></p>
<p><strong>Commercial cloud computing&nbsp;services</strong></p>
<p>The recent Mars Science Laboratory mission demonstrates how <span class="caps">NASA</span> is
modernizing its approach to Big Data by utilizing cloud computing and
commercially available cloud storage solutions. In less than four
months, <span class="caps">NASA</span> engineered and migrated legacy content management system
and websites to Amazon Web Services. <span class="caps">MSL</span> relied heavily on
mission-critical applications that could sustain failure of over a
dozen data centers, while delivering over 150 Gigabits per second of
traffic to a global community of operators, scientists, and general
public. The team developed a solution that would download raw images
and telemetry directly from Curiosity and place them into Amazon S3
storage buckets. As the data streamed in, every image from Mars was
uploaded, processed, stored, and delivered from the cloud. The data
was then catalogued in highly available and scalable databases and
exposed to applications and users via a Restful interface. This
allowed the content managers for the Mars Web sites to easily create
informative Web pages with powerful real–time images. This modern
approach allowed <span class="caps">NASA</span> to deliver 120 <span class="caps">TB</span> of dynamic content and 30 <span class="caps">TB</span>
of static content the first night, and meet the demands when over 8
million hits were requested of their websites in less than one minute.
It also allowed the team to take advantage of the <span class="caps">JPL</span> Galaxy and <span class="caps">JPL</span>
Nebula supercomputers which ran close to 200 24-hour Monte Carlo
simulations at 20 <span class="caps">GB</span> each during the&nbsp;mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Real World application of what <span class="caps">NASA</span> is doing with Big&nbsp;Data</strong></p>
<p>The benefits of what <span class="caps">NASA</span> is doing in big data are not limited to just
the government! In fact, this work has very real implications for you.
One real world example of how <span class="caps">NASA</span> leverages its expertise in big data,
and directly affects your life, is in the field of airline safety. <span class="caps">NASA</span>
is involved in analyzing data collected from planes <a href="http://www.allanalytics.com/author.asp?section_id=1411&amp;doc_id=250894">to study safety
implications</a>, which in turn will help with commercial airlines’
maintenance procedure improvements and potentially prevent equipment
failures. Using advanced algorithms, the agency helped tease out
relevant information from a mountain of unstructured data to help
predict and prevent safety problems. Using the open-source Multiple
Kernel Anomaly Detection (<span class="caps">MKAD</span>) algorithm, the agency determined how two
continuous data streams or networks are similar, and then analyzed them
using a single framework to detect patterns to automatically discovering
precursors related to adverse events while an airplane is in&nbsp;flight.</p>
<p><strong>A Big Data&nbsp;Opportunity</strong></p>
<p>From analyzing the real-time solar plasma ejections and monitoring
global climate change to optimizing large scale engineering designs and
modernizing the way we approach mission operations, <span class="caps">NASA</span> is a leader in
the application of big data. At <span class="caps">NASA</span> we are continuing to experiment
with new ways to harness this shifting environment and tackle the many
challenges it poses to government and the way we do business. Although
we are just in the beginning stages of in exploring the big data
universe, the opportunities are truly&nbsp;limitless.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/">Open Government Plan</a> outlines a number of <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/plan/open-data/">specific
actions</a> we are taking to drive innovations in technology
around big data. We’ve created <a href="http://data.nasa.gov">data.nasa.gov</a> as a starting point to
engage with our data, but this is simply a directory of all the
wonderful data <span class="caps">NASA</span> makes available. We will also continue to leverage
<a href="http://www.data.gov">data.gov</a> to enable users to locate relevant high quality data and
easy to use tools and&nbsp;applications.</p>
<p>We set a goal to &#8220;<em>create new opportunities for enhanced coordination
across <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Big Data activities, and expanded cooperation with other
agencies</em>&#8221; with the intention of encouraging citizens to utilize raw
datasets and create applications relevant to <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s mission. Yesterday,
<span class="caps">NASA</span> joined the National Science Foundation and the Department of
Energy’s Office of Science to announce the &#8220;<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/10/03/nasa-tournament-labs-big-data-challenge/">Big Data Challenge</a>&#8220;, a
series of competitions which will be hosted on the TopCoder platform.
Competitors will be tasked with imagining mobile apps that find new
value hidden in discrete government information domains and then
describing how they may be shared as universal, cross-agency solutions
that transcend the limitations of individual silos. This is a fresh new
opportunity to work with us and help conceptualize new and novel
approaches that our critical to the future success of government and we
encourage you to check it&nbsp;out.</p>
