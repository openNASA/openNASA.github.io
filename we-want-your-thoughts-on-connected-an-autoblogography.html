						<p>Earlier tonight, we hosted an advanced screening of the acclaimed
Sundance documentary <a href="http://connectedthefilm.com/">Connected: An Autoblogography about Love, Death <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
Technology</a> at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/offices/ocio/itsummit/index.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="caps">IT</span> Summit</a>.</p>
<p>In “<em>Connected</em>“, <strong>Tiffany Shlain</strong>, award-winning filmmaker and
founder of The Webby Awards, traces interdependence througha history,
discovering surprising links between right brain and left; honey bees
and stress; hormones and happiness; technology and nature; progress and
consequences; and parents and children. The result: a personal film with
universal&nbsp;resonance.</p>
<p>If you liked the film, you can also see Tiffany speak at tomorrow&#8217;s
<a href="http://tedxnasa.com/silicon-valley/speakers/">TEDxNASA@SiliconValley</a>, which will also be streamed online <a href="http://tedxnasa.com/silicon-valley/live-stream/">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can view the trailer&nbsp;below:</p>

<p>We want to know how <strong>you</strong> enjoyed the film and what <strong>your</strong> thoughts
are on how it relates to <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s continually growing exploration of
collaborative technologies. We&#8217;d love to have a discussion in our
comments on this topic and other ideas from the themes seen in the film.
Some potential areas for&nbsp;discussion:</p>
<ol>
<li>How does collaboration at <span class="caps">NASA</span> mirror the idea of connectedness
    shown in the film? Can our ten centers be seen as the trees in the
    forest with a common system of&nbsp;roots?</li>
<li>There was a large emphasis in the film on the impact <span class="caps">NASA</span> has had on
    both the filmmaker and the world. What ability does <span class="caps">NASA</span> have to
    influence collaboration and inspiration on others? How can we, as an
    <span class="caps">IT</span> organization, contribute to&nbsp;this?</li>
<li>How do you as an individual feel you fit in with the bigger mission
    of <span class="caps">NASA</span>? How do you see yourself as critical to our&nbsp;success?</li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly: did you like the film? What thoughts do
    you have on the creator&#8217;s life adventure and her way of illustrating
    it to the viewer? Would you like to see more of these types of
    screenings at future <span class="caps">NASA</span>&nbsp;events?</li>
</ol>

We look forward to talking with you about the film and hearing your
