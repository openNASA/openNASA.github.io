						<p><em>We need your help!</em> There are a number of exciting space related panels
proposed for next year’s <a href="http://sxsw.com/interactive">South by Southwest</a> festival in Austin. <span class="caps">SXSW</span>
is a community-driven event and voting accounts for 30% of the
decision-making process for any given programming slot. The selection
process is extremely competitive and this year there are 3600 proposed
panels, of which only 500 get selected. The more votes we submit for the
space panels, the more likely a panel related to space exploration will
be included in the final SxSW program. Voting ends on Friday, September
2 (11:59 <span class="caps">PM</span> <span class="caps">CST</span>), so please vote <em>today</em>!</p>
<p>To help you out, we’ve put together a directory for all the space
related panels. This includes panels that have <span class="caps">NASA</span> representation as
well others that may not necessarily be <span class="caps">NASA</span>&nbsp;affiliated.</p>

<p>Want to change the world? Then get a license to RHoK! Random Hacks of
Kindness (RHoK) is a global initiative to create practical open source
solutions to humanity&#8217;s toughest challenges. Organized by Google,
Microsoft, Yahoo!, <span class="caps">HP</span>, <span class="caps">NASA</span> and the World Bank, RhoK brings together
thousands of the best and brightest developers from around the world -
like <span class="caps">YOU</span> - to participate in fast–paced and competitive marathon coding
events resulting in real applications that are making an impact on
humanity. The RHoK community has grown rapidly over the past 2 years,
with 3000 participants from 43 cities who have worked on 214 distinct
solutions. This talk will bring together &#8220;RHoKstars&#8221; to provide an
overview of the initiative, discuss some of the solutions developed,
describe how the SxSW community can contribute to the effort and most
importantly, brainstorm about what is next. …and if they let us, we&#8217;ll
be playing rock music and lighting off&nbsp;fireworks!</p>

<p>Want to make some money? Federal agencies have recently been given the
authority by Congress to sponsor competitions for individuals, groups,
and companies to develop new ideas and technology innovations for a
chance to win potentially lucrative prizes. These competitions can range
from new mobile outreach technologies to web-based data analytics tools
to even vehicle-to-vehicle communications; the government is looking for
breakthrough technologies from the minds of the most innovative and
forward thinking Americans, many of whom are at <span class="caps">SXSW</span>. This session will
highlight some of the coolest prizes for technology development that the
government has been involved in to date, including the <span class="caps">DOT</span>’s Connected
Vehicle Challenge, the <span class="caps">VA</span>’s Open Source and blue button projects, and
<span class="caps">NASA</span>’s centennial challenges. Additionally you will learn about some

<p>Not unlike a zombie horde ready to devour red tape and uninspired
project managers, this enthusiastic movement sees brains as valuable
assets to take over the world. Learn why these people got so
passionately involved in space, how they became good friends over the
Internet, and what they’ve created to make measurable change toward a

struggle to survive, these Internet-enabled groups are flourishing with

<p>Slightly over a year ago we had this idea of trying to launch a ballon
into the stratosphere (\~100,000 feet) with a couple of cameras and get
it back down safely. Since then we&#8217;ve launched 6 balloons and
successfully recovered all of them. We learned a lot in the process: how
inert gases cannot explode but can instead make other things explode,
how to calculate volumes and weights appropriately to attain the desired
height before the descent, how dropping the payload in salted water can
be harmful for the cameras, how to put more and more sensors in the
payload and still have it lift off, and how ideas that sometimes seem
brilliant may cover hidden dangers (and extremely ridiculous moments).
We have also managed to gather dozens and dozens of people around this
movement, up to the point of having 12 cars with 5 people each and lots
of gear running after 3 balloons simultaneously. And did we tell you
running away from wild animals? Apart from telling (and showing) you all
these things, we will also unveil our ideas for the future and answer
your questions if you&#8217;re planning to launch a <span class="caps">HAB</span>.</p>

<p>The relationship most adults have with science is one of observation:
watching government agencies explore on behalf of us, but not actually
exploring it ourselves. Science should be disruptively accessible –
empowering people from a variety of different backgrounds to explore,
participate in, and build new ways of interacting with and contributing
to science. By having a fresh set of eyes from those who solve different
types of problems, new concepts often emerge and go on to influence
science in unexpected ways. A grassroots effort called Science Hack Day
aims to bridge the gap between the science, technology and design
industries. A Hack Day is a 48 hour all-night event that brings
different people with good ideas together in the same physical space for
a brief but intense period of collaboration, hacking, and building ‘cool
stuff’. By collaborating on focused tasks during this short period,
small groups of hackers are capable of producing remarkable&nbsp;results.</p>
<p><em>Questions&nbsp;Answered:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>How is hacking actually contributing to&nbsp;science?</li>
<li><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I&#8217;m not a developer, what can I&nbsp;do?&#8221;</li>
<li>What types of things can I make with&nbsp;science?</li>

<li>How can I create a Science Hack Day in my&nbsp;city?</li>

<p>When <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s budget was drastically cut and the commercial aerospace
industry found itself in charge of getting man into space, a group of
&#8220;space geeks&#8221; consisting of web developers, aerospace scientists and
engineers, and people who have a dream of living in space started
meeting up and designed the rules, developed the application, and are
sharing Space Points and are increasing awareness publicly about space
policy, increasing funding to aerospace-related research (commercial and
government), and having fun playing to&nbsp;win!</p>

<li>How did the process for crowdsourcing the inital concept and rules
    behind SpacePoints&nbsp;work?</li>

<li>What success/case studies can you share around an increase in
    engagement and education around space-related topics in America and
