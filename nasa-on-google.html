						<p>Our world population has doubled in the past 50 years. We had three
billion in 1959, four billion in 1974, five billion in 1987 and six
billion in 1998. A little over one week ago, the human population on
planet Earth reached seven billion. This marks an important milestone
for our species. Fifty years ago, shortly before John F. Kennedy issued
his challenge to reach the moon, we had just crossed the three billion
mark. This expansion is a testament to our ability to produce, grow, and
connect. Perhaps the most important innovation tying us together since
then has been the advent of the public Internet. As we’ve grown and
become more dispersed over the planet, the Internet has allowed us to
instantaneously connect and communicate in new and exciting&nbsp;ways.</p>
<p>Although we may still see the Internet largely as a productivity tool,
or as a way to access information, it’s become so much more than that.
It’s a collaboration platform that is bringing us together. With the
acceleration of digital convergence and increasingly pervasive use of
digital devices to access all manner of information, the Internet has
become a platform for participation. Each second, the world’s
information is increasingly sorted, sifted, and combined in various
useful and creative ways by communities of people from all corners of
the world. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and now Google+ are
reshaping human interactions and helping us connect to one&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>As an agency trusted with charting the universe and expanding human
knowledge, <span class="caps">NASA</span> has long been at the forefront of using the Internet to
communicate with and involve citizens in our mission of space
exploration, scientific discovery, and aeronautics research. <span class="caps">NASA</span> had
one of the first websites on the Internet in the 90s, obtained one of
the first accounts on Twitter in 2007, and began Tweeting in late 2008.
We have now launched our <span class="caps">NASA</span> presence on Google+ as the first
government agency on the&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>This is an exciting step for <span class="caps">NASA</span> and we have already seen enormous
interest from the Google+ community - we had over a thousand new
followers in the first hour! We look forward to exploring this new
engagement platform and innovating how <span class="caps">NASA</span> shares&nbsp;information.</p>
