    <h1>Telephone Replacement&nbsp;Strategy</h1>
    

    <p>The National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (<span class="caps">NASA</span>) Johnson Space
Center (<span class="caps">JSC</span>) located in Houston, <span class="caps">TX</span> and White Sands Test Facility (<span class="caps">WSTF</span>)
located in Las Cruces, New Mexico is soliciting information for
replacing the Telephone System in the year 2014&nbsp;timeframe.</p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> –<span class="caps">JSC</span>-<span class="caps">WSTF</span> is seeking capability statements/ideas on how to replace
an existing Private Branch Exchange (<span class="caps">PBX</span>) system supporting 15,000
handsets with utilizing a cost saving technologies that integrates with
smart phones from all interested&nbsp;parties.</p>
<p>No solicitation exists; therefore, do not request a copy of the
solicitation. If a solicitation is released it will be synopsized in
FedBizOpps and on the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Acquisition Internet Service. It is the
potential vendor’s responsibility to monitor these sites for the release
of any solicitation or&nbsp;synopsis.</p>
<p><a href="http://nasa.uservoice.com/forums/161797-nasa-telephone-replacement-strategy">Ask a question about the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Telephone Replacement&nbsp;Strategy</a></p>
<p><strong>Background information</strong>:</p>
<p>A. <span class="caps">JSC</span> has a <span class="caps">PBX</span> Siemens Electronic Switch (<span class="caps">EWSD</span>) Central Office (<span class="caps">CO</span>)
telephone infrastructure that supports approximately 15,000 telephones,
and has a combination of digital and analog circuits. The <span class="caps">CO</span> consists of
a host switch and three remote switches that interface with <span class="caps">AT</span>&amp;T as the
external communications provider. There are a total of 437 Integrated
Services Digital Network (<span class="caps">ISDN</span>) lines to the host telephone switch at
<span class="caps">JSC</span>, 46 <span class="caps">ISDN</span> lines to a remote telephone switch at <span class="caps">JSC</span> that terminate in
Building 30, and 46 <span class="caps">ISDN</span> lines to a remote telephone switch that is
located at Ellington Field. Ellington Field is used by <span class="caps">NASA</span> to support
astronaut flight training and is located about 5.5 miles away from <span class="caps">JSC</span>.
The Siemens telephone switch also provides long distance services for
the center. There are 23 <span class="caps">ISDN</span> lines and 96 T1 connected to the Siemens
host telephone&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>There is an existing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) deployment at
<span class="caps">JSC</span> with approximately 1500 Cisco VoIP handsets and licenses deployed,
which is currently connected to the Siemens telephone switch. The <span class="caps">JSC</span>
VoIP infrastructure includes 2 VoIP gateways with four Primary Rate
Interfaces (<span class="caps">PRI</span>) supporting them, two call mangers, Unity voicemail
server, Unified Cisco Contact Express (<span class="caps">UCCX</span>) (help desk/contact agent
service) server, Cisco Unified Application Environment (<span class="caps">CUAE</span>) (call
forward / capability to connect to external services to the telephone
system)&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">JSC</span> network has a highly redundant Core, Distribution and Access
Layer architecture. The data rates for the network include a
predominantly 1Gb backbone (with 10G portions, e.g. Data Center) and 100
Mb connections to end user devices. The access layer devices support
Power over Ethernet (<span class="caps">POE</span>) and end devices are connected using Cat5e or
better cabling. Also, there are 23 <span class="caps">ISDN</span> lines and one Cisco gateway
located at the Sonny Carter Test Facility (<span class="caps">SCTF</span>). <span class="caps">SCTF</span> is an astronaut
training facility located about 6 miles away from the Johnson Space
Center. There are approximately 100 facilities at the <span class="caps">JSC</span> site, which is
comprised of an inter mall area of 35 facilities. The remaining
facilities are in the outer areas within the site. The <span class="caps">JSC</span> Call Manager
also supports approximately 30 VoIP phones at <span class="caps">WSTF</span>.</p>
<p>B. The <span class="caps">WSTF</span> location has a Nortel Meridian/Option 61c <span class="caps">PBX</span> telephone
system and a Norstar Key system with three interconnected nodes and one
standalone node. Of the three interconnected nodes, two reside on the
<span class="caps">WSTF</span> main campus and one resides at the White Sands Space Harbor (<span class="caps">WSSH</span>)
located on the White Sands Missile Range (<span class="caps">WSMR</span>). <span class="caps">WSTF</span> is supported by
Century Link as their external communication provider. There are
approximately 860 telephones, modems and sensors. The capacities of the
2 <span class="caps">WSTF</span> campus PBXs are as following: Node 1—792 digital and 512 analog
lines; Node 2—576 digital and 160 analog line. The configuration of
T1/<span class="caps">FTS</span> lines equates to 24 inbound/outbound, 24 outbound only and 24
long distances. The trunking capacities to the remote sites are 48
trunks from Node 1 to Node 2, and 72 trunks from Node 2 to <span class="caps">WSSH</span>. The one
standalone node is located at the El Paso Hangar Forward Operations
Facility, and it has a Nortel Norstar Key System and supports 28 phones.
External communications to the El Paso Hanger are provided by <span class="caps">AT</span>&amp;T which
include copper trunks, four inbound <span class="caps">DID</span> and six&nbsp;outbound.</p>
<p>Vendor(s) are encouraged to submit informational proposals on all of the
key areas listed&nbsp;below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Provide an approach for total replacement of the current <span class="caps">PBX</span> based
    telephone (circuit switch technology) systems at <span class="caps">JSC</span> and <span class="caps">WSTF</span> with
    an implementation of a telephone (packet switch technology) system
    (15,000&nbsp;handsets).</li>
<li>Provide a telephony replacement system for <span class="caps">JSC</span> and <span class="caps">NASA</span> that can
    scale to a maximum of 65,000&nbsp;handsets.</li>
