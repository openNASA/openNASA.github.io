<h3></h3>
<h3><span style="color: #ffffff;"><strong>Project</strong></span></h3>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This 27&#8217; long Airstream began its career at <span class="caps">NASA</span> in 1989 as the Shuttle
Modal Inspection System. After the Space Shuttle Program ended the
trailer became excess and was available for other&nbsp;uses.</p>
<p>At <span class="caps">NASA</span> Johnson Space Center, the Center Operations Directorate has set
a goal to expand the use of the outdoor mall area and take full
advantage of the beauty and serenity of the ponds, trees and wildlife.
We decided to conduct a low-cost experiment with the Airstream and
create an outdoor meeting and gathering area for employees in the center
of the&nbsp;mall.</p>
<h3><strong>Project</strong> <strong>Sputnik</strong></h3>
<p>The Center Operations Directorate has turned the historic Airstream into
a collaborative meeting area, code-named &#8220;Sputnik&#8221;.  The project pays
homage to the past while linking to our future. The Airstreams&#8217; unique
silver exterior invokes the same creative flair seen in the world&#8217;s
first satellite. Sputnik launched from the same pad that now carriers
our astronauts to the International Space&nbsp;Station.</p>
<p>Sputnik&#8217;s features&nbsp;include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sustainable power in the form of a solar generator and <span class="caps">LED</span> light&nbsp;fixtures</li>
<li>An outdoor sitting area for casual&nbsp;meetings</li>
<li>An indoor meeting area for small&nbsp;groups</li>
<li>Whiteboards and large post-it-note&nbsp;paper</li>
<li>A small table for private&nbsp;work</li>
<li>The Airlock - a two person &#8220;back porch&#8221; complete with a raisable
    hatch to enjoy the full view of the natural&nbsp;outdoors</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Explore!</strong></h3>
<p>We invite you to meet, eat, drink a little coffee, create or enjoy the
area in any way you wish. Planned activities include luncheon &#8220;<span class="caps">AMA</span> (Ask
Me Anything)&#8221; informal sessions with members of senior staff and perhaps
even Acoustic Thursdays featuring lunchtime music from some of <span class="caps">JSC</span>&#8217;s
home grown artists. Feel free to suggest other planned activities as you&nbsp;wish.</p>
<p>The Sputnik experiment will run through the winter (our best time of the
year!) and will be evaluated in the Spring to see how well it worked and
whether it will be relocated to a different area or&nbsp;purpose.</p>
<h3><strong>How We Did&nbsp;It</strong></h3>
<p>The Sputnik conversion from mobile lab to meeting area was accomplished
through volunteered efforts of <span class="caps">JA</span> employees, from sewing cushions, to
painting cabinets, to stenciling designs. Many thanks to all of the
volunteers that made this experiment&nbsp;possible.</p>
