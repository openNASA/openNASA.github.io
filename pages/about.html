<p><span class="caps">NASA</span> is expanding transparency, participation, and collaboration and
creating a new level of openness and accountability. We are focusing on
embedding open government into three integrated aspects of our
operations—policy, technology, and culture. Whether <span class="caps">NASA</span> is using social
networks to allow students to interact directly with astronauts, or
creating a Cloud Computing Platform to give unprecedented access to
scientific data, we have embraced the Open Government&nbsp;Directive.</p>
<p><strong>About&nbsp;open.nasa.gov</strong></p>
<p>open.nasa.gov is a collaborative platform for the open government
community to share success stories and projects they are working on.
 The content on this site is written by <span class="caps">NASA</span> employees and contractors
across the agency. We are excited to highlight the ways that
transparency, participation, and collaboration are being embraced by
<span class="caps">NASA</span> policy, technology, and culture – and the amazing future that
becomes possible because of that&nbsp;commitment.</p>

<p><strong>Highlights from <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Open Government&nbsp;Plan</strong></p>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s founding legislation in 1958 instructed <span class="caps">NASA</span> to “…provide for the
widest practicable and appropriate dissemination of information…” The
principles of open government have been embedded in our operations for
50+ years. We recognize that open government is a process rather than a
product, and have taken a continuous-learning&nbsp;approach.</p>
<p>We believe that integrating Open Government Principles into existing
systems (e.g., governance councils and performance management system)
provides the best framework for success. Throughout the plan we
establish a solid foundation for institutional change based on the five
<span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government&nbsp;principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase Agency transparency and accountability to external&nbsp;stakeholders.</li>
<li>Enable citizen participation in <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s&nbsp;mission.</li>
<li>Improve internal <span class="caps">NASA</span> collaboration and&nbsp;innovation.</li>
<li>Encourage partnerships than can create economic&nbsp;opportunity.</li>
<li>Institutionalize Open Government philosophies and practices at <span class="caps">NASA</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="caps">NASA</span>’s Open Government activities span 22 identified Agency projects
across the centers, and 3 flagship initiatives will take the Initiative
to a new&nbsp;level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Policy</strong>: <span class="caps">NASA</span> is working to make open source software development
    more collaborative at <span class="caps">NASA</span> to benefit both the Agency and the&nbsp;public.</li>
<li><strong>Technology</strong>: <span class="caps">NASA</span> Nebula, as the government&#8217;s first open-source
    cloud computing platform, offers an easier way for <span class="caps">NASA</span> scientists
    and researchers to share large, complex data sets with external
    partners and the&nbsp;public.</li>
<li><strong>Culture</strong>: The creation of a new <span class="caps">NASA</span> Participatory Exploration
    Office will infuse more public participation into <span class="caps">NASA</span>’s&nbsp;mission.</li>
</ul>
