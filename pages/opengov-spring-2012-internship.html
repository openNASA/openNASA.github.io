    <h1><span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government Initiative Spring 2012 Internship&nbsp;Opportunity</h1>
    

    <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Deadline Extended:</strong> Applications now
due at 11:59pm <span class="caps">EST</span> on Friday, October 28,&nbsp;2011</span></p>
<p>Are you a college student looking to make a difference in your
world&#8230;and beyond? Do you love the idea of using technology make
government more collaborative, participatory, and transparent? Does your
childhood dream of someday working for <span class="caps">NASA</span> still live&nbsp;on?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve answered yes to the above questions, and you&#8217;ll be spending
your 2012 spring semester in either Washington, <span class="caps">DC</span>, or Houston, <span class="caps">TX</span>, then
read on! The <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government Initiative is looking for innovative
undergraduates to join our team for one-semester internships at <span class="caps">NASA</span>
Headquarters and <span class="caps">NASA</span> Johnson Space&nbsp;Center.</p>
<p><strong>What is the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Open Government&nbsp;Initiative?</strong></p>
<p>The Open Government Initiative is an innovative strategy for changing
how government works. The aim of open government is to take advantage of
the know-how and entrepreneurial spirit of those outside government
institutions to work together with those inside government to solve
problems. Open Government is all about embracing the concept of &#8220;open
innovation&#8221; - the idea that working in a transparent, participatory, and
collaborative fashion helps improve performance, inform decision-making,
encourage entrepreneurship, and solve problems more&nbsp;effectively.</p>
<p>As a member of <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s OpenGov team, you&#8217;ll be working on a number of
projects throughout the agency related to open government activities.
Some examples of projects we&#8217;ll have you working on&nbsp;include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Collaborating with <span class="caps">NASA</span> scientists and engineers across the country
    to help make data from their missions publicly&nbsp;available</li>
<li>Working with graphic designers, web developers, and creative artists
    to find ways to showcase <span class="caps">NASA</span> initiatives to members of the&nbsp;public.</li>
<li>Helping guide <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s policy and strategy on Open Source Software&nbsp;development</li>
<li>Working with partners from Google, Yahoo!, Microsoft, <span class="caps">HP</span>, and the
    World Bank on <a href="http://www.rhok.org">Random Hacks Of&nbsp;Kindness</a></li>
<li>Writing white papers and briefing <span class="caps">NASA</span> management on the progress of
    OpenGov activities in the&nbsp;agency.</li>
<li>Blogging about your experience on <a href="http://open.nasa.gov">open.<span class="caps">NASA</span>.gov</a></li>
</ol>
<p>A huge part of this internship will be self-guidance. Much like Google&#8217;s
20% time, we&#8217;ll want you to take part of your time here to start your
own OpenGov project. We&#8217;ll work with you to find a project you are
interested in and passionate about, then allow you to take the reins and
manage it. In the past, OpenGov interns have created Android Apps using
<span class="caps">NASA</span> data, the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/open/statusdashboard.html">OpenGov Progress Dashboard</a>, and worked on projects
like <a href="http://www.fragileoasis.org">Fragile Oasis</a> and <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/connect/tweetup/index.html"><span class="caps">NASA</span> Tweetups</a>.</p>
<p>Although we have no requirement for a specific major or program for
applicants, <strong>this position will be primarily policy-focused</strong>. Thus, a
background in public policy, political science, business, or a related
field will be extremely useful. A love for space exploration and an
inquisitive nature are essential, as are self-motivation, strong writing
chops and experience in using web technologies. Additionally, knowledge
of <span class="caps">HTML</span>/<span class="caps">CSS</span> and Wordpress are desired but not required. To apply, fill
out the form below. <strong>Applications are due ~~Sunday, October 9, 2011~~
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Friday, October 28, 2011</span> at 11:59pm
Eastern Time. This position is&nbsp;unpaid.</strong></p>
