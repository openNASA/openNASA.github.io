NASA will host an Open Government Community Summit on Wednesday, October
13, 2010 from 9pm - 12:30pm at NASA HQ. The [Open Government Community
Summit Series][] is an inter-agency collaborative event hosted by a
different agency each month, facilitated by the Open Forum Foundation.
The September workshop was hosted by the EPA and the November workshop
will be hosted by the OPM. Previous summits and workshops have been
hosted by the Department of Transportation, the General Services
Administration, the US Department of Agriculture, and the US Department
of Treasury.

NASA has a solid schedule planned with a heavy emphasis on remote
participation for those that cannot attend in person. The first hour
will include presentations from leaders in the Open Government Community
as well as remarks from Astronaut Jose Hernandez. The presentations will
be streamed on NASA TV and will begin at 9am and conclude at 10am.
Afterwards, the participants will move into the collaborative workshop
which will take place at NASA HQ and online. Due to the availability of
live streaming and Internet access, this will be our most collaborative
workshop so far. Registration is required to receive all the information
regarding the event, so if you have not registered, do so today!

The focus of the collaborative workship is on agency's use of open data
and the future of the open government community. This summit will
provide an opportunity for us to also document the challenges to open
government that span multiple agencies, and to take concrete steps
toward overcoming them. To be clear, this is not a discussion about
NASAâ€™s Open Government Plan, rather its an opportunity for the OpenGov
community to spend the day working together on common OpenGov topics.
