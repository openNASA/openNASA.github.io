Whether you're a scientist, a software developer, an educator, a
student, a maker, or just a space geek, we hope you enjoy building
innovative solutions at this year's International Space Apps Challenge. 
Collaboration - both locally and globaly - is the core of this event. 
Ask for help, take risks, and try something new!

...and when it all starts to come together, make it official and submit
your project!  Here are a few things to keep in mind:

1.  To enter a project you need a name, a description, and a license
    that you release the work under, so be prepared for that.
2.  Once you enter a project, you can come back and edit it as often as
    you like.
3.  Make sure ALL of your teammates get entered in. This is important in
    the cases when awards are given, or folks are otherwise recognized.

Now get this "paperwork" done and go back to the fun stuff -- but
remember: if you don't enter it as a project, it didn't happen at Space
Apps!!
