A NASA [Tweetup][] is a special opportunity to give guests
behind-the-scenes access to NASA hardware and facilities. Participants
are generally chosen by lottery via an open web process and invited to a
NASA center to watch a launch, share an experience, or get an inside
look at what happens at a center. NASA tweetups are anywhere from
several hours to a few days and have included space shuttle launches,
science missions, ISS downlinks, mission control - just about every
aspect of spaceflight you can imagine.

As of August 2011, over 2,000 participants have been part of official
NASA Tweetups since the first event at JPL in January 2009. NASA, in an
attempt to measure the impact of one tweetup, tracked 10,665 tweets
originating from 150 participants in the [Juno Tweetup][] as well as the
subsequent retweets and found 29.9 million potential impressions.

**That's a lot of outreach. **I've participated in NASA Tweetups as a
NASA ambassador for events at my own center (STS-130, first JSC tweetup)
as well as a regular participant at another center. ([SOFIA at NASA Ames
Research Center][]) Every time I have seen some of the best NASA has to
offer.

What's exciting about tweetups:

-   This is social media as it is meant to function. NASA gets to tell
    their own story without a filter, listen and engage the public
    response, and interact directly with it. Tweetups also create
    community among often isolated followers, connecting them to NASA
    and to each other - and inspiring projects that aren't sustained by
    NASA but by the community itself.
-   An extremely motivated, space-enthusiastic community who are ready
    to engage with NASA's mission at a whole new level. It's amazing to
    be in the company of people who sometimes have a wider knowledge of
    space history and trivia than many of us at NASA! I thought I was a
    space geek... but tweetups give a whole new definition to space
    geek!
-   The NASA Tweetup community (led by our friend [Jon Verville][]) has
    set up their own [community wiki][] to share their experiences and
    multiply their impact. They track each tweetup's participants,
    schedule, media mentions, and mission references. The wiki also
    includes guides for first time attendeees as well as ways to [stay
    involved][].

Because here's the reality: [citizen engagement][] means that we are
developing active evangelists and advocates for the space program - not
just passive spectators. When we encourage NASA's scientists and
engineers to engage in real conversation with the public, it's effective
*communication*. When they understand what and why NASA is doing, they
tend to share it with others - and this is creating *relevancy*. As NASA
becomes more relevant to people, it builds trust and finds more and more
advocates in the community who care about and want to contribute to the
exploration vision, and this is *inspiration*. And it just keeps going
from there...

Do you wonder how NASA got into this Twitter thing anyway? Read [here][]
for a great story by JPL's [Veronica McGregor][] about the @MarsPhoenix
story.

Another great story: one tweetup was cut short by some [on-orbit
excitement][].

Today marks the 28th NASA Tweetup, happening at [Wallops Island][].
Follow along on Twitter ([@NASA\_Wallops][] and [@NASAtweetup][]) to
join their adventure!
