![Science Hack Day][]

**What are the technologies you are currently using on open.nasa.gov?**

<div>

-   **LAMP - **open.NASA is hosted on a [LAMP
    stack][] ([Linux][], [Apache][], [MySQL][], [PHP][]). All of these
    are open source applications that are near-universal. If you’ve
    built a website before, it’s most likely been on LAMP.
-   **WordPress - **The core of open.NASA is [WordPress 3.2.1][], an
    open source content management system approved for use by both NASA
    and the [General Services Administration][]. We made no tweaks to
    the WordPress core for the site – it grabbed from the [SVN
    repository][] and set up out of the box.
-   **Theme - **The site is running a modified version of
    the free [Protean theme][] for WordPress by [MAQE][]. We made a few
    changes to the theme to create a unique look and feel to the site.
    We really like the design due to how clean and simple it presents
    the content. Plus, each post allows for customization by the author
    to give everyone a bit of personality.
-   **Disqus - **Our comments are driven by [Disqus][], a GSA approved
    commenting system that connects conversations happening across the
    web.

**Can I clone your site?**

</div>

*Absolutely*!  This site is built entirely off of Open Source Software,
so you can easily recreate it if you would like to. Visit
<http://www.wordpress.org> to download Wordpress CMS 3.2.1. Visit
[http://github.com/mage/Protean/][] to download the theme.  See above
list of technologies used.

**How do I submit an idea or bug to you?  
**

We want to hear from you! We’ve opened a [UserVoice account][] to get
your feedback on our site, our projects, and hear your ideas for new
ways NASA can be more participatory, collaborative, and transparent with
the public. Be sure to also let us know via UserVoice if you see any
errors or bugs on the site. None of us are web developers by day, and we
definitely want to know if there’s something that need to be fixed.  We
read all feedback that comes in, but we are not able to respond to
everyone. But be assured we appreciate any input.
