[![Open Source Summit][]][]

Open source brings numerous benefits to government software projects,
including increased software quality, reduced development costs, faster
development cycles, and reduced barriers to public-private collaboration
through new opportunities to commercialize technology. This inherently
transparent, participatory, and collaborative approach is
revolutionizing the way software is created, improved, and used.

NASA has hosted two Open Source Summits to convene leaders from
government and industry as well as software practitioners to discuss the
development, release and use of open source software in government.

This website archives the proceedings, presentations and videos from
those events.

### Open Source Summit \#1 {#oss1}

**March 29-30, 2011**

On March 29 and 30, 2011, NASA hosted the first Open Source Summit at
Ames Research Center in Mountain View California. Facilitated by Wayne
Moses Burke and Lucas Cioffi of the Open Forum Foundation, this “Focus
Forum” style event focused on moving beyond abstract discussion to
produce real, actionable solutions to NASA’s toughest open source
challenges. Throughout the event, guest speakers provided insights into
best practices and shared valuable lessons learned in building and
leveraging open source communities.

Participants were split into discussion sessions to address challenges
with the existing policy framework and brainstorm potential solutions.
Focus groups included licensing, government restrictions such as the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations, governance, and risk
assessments.

Physical participation in the Open Source Summit \#1 was limited,
however virtual participation was open to anyone through live streaming,
electronic discussion, and collaborative note taking.

### Open Source Summit \#2 {#oss2}

**June 20-21, 2012**

On June 20th and 21st 2012, NASA, in partnership with the Veteran
Affairs Innovation Initiative (VAi2) and the State Department, hosted
the second ‘Open Source Summit’ to advance the use of open source
software in government. The summit took place at the University of
Maryland Business School in College Park, Maryland. It was facilitated
by Wayne Moses Burke of the Open Forum Foundation and provided high
energy, relevant speakers to educate the participants interspersed with
deep discussions to ensure that everyone gets questions answered and
information that is directly relevant to their interests and needs.
