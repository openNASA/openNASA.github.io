This weekend, more then 9,000 people and 484 organizations from around
the world came together in 83 cities across 44 countries, as well as
online, to engage directly with NASA at the [largest hackathon ever
held][]. In just 83 total hours, we collectively tackled the [58
challenges][] by developing awe-inspiring software, buiding jaw-dropping
hardware, and creating stunning data visualizations that together
resulted in one giant leap towards improving life on Earth and life in
space. After the dust settled, an impressive [750+ solutions][] were
submitted.

The [International Space Apps Challenge][] was the culmination of months
of planning, years of experimentation and thousands and thousands of
hours of hard work from people across the globe who share in the
excitement of building our collective future. It is a shining example
that transparency, participation and collaboration are alive and well at
NASA. This event could not have been possible without you.

Our space program, more then ever, requires the active engagement of the
public to co-create our future. This weekend demonstrated the true
potential of participatory exploration and what can happen when a
government agency like NASA takes a chance on engaging the untapped,
unexpected, and uncharted know-how of thousands of passionate citizens
around the world.

**THANK YOU for participating in the International Space Apps
Challenge.**

With huge respect,

Nick, Ali, Chris, Sean and the Space Apps team
