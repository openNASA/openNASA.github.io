As David Wheeler said in his presentation at the NASA Open Source Summit
on March 27th, 2011, “*you are breaking the law of you don’t consider
open source software development in your projects*” – and he’s
absolutely right! So that got me thinking, how many Open Source software
projects has NASA actually released in the last year? Here’s the answer:
20. What’s disappointing to me is that the majority of the official
release came from only one center – and in that regard Ames Research
Center is truly a trailblazer at NASA when it comes to Open Source
Software. Our hope in Open Government is that this number will star to
exponentially increase moving forward and that all NASA centers will
start to participate. We recognize that many people many not release
with an open source license because there are too many barriers in place
to do so.

We are an invested stakeholder in helping solve that problem, but it
will take some time. Therefore, I wanted to inspire you with concrete
examples of the open source success stories from around the agency. The
list below is the 20 projects that released software open source this
past year (the release date is listed in parenthesis). These are the
trailblazers! These projects are all active and it’s likely that most of
the people who worked through the current software release process are
still involved. I encourage you to reach out to the project leaders,
learn from their experience, and let them serve as an example of what is
possible in your space program!
