We are always on the lookout for great visualizations of space data and
this one [Carlo Zapponi][] does not disappoint.

The visualization titled [BOLIDES][] is a beautiful representation of
the data from the The Meteoritical Society on all the known meteorites
that have hit Earth.  The design focuses on those meteorites that were
eye-witnessed when falling and hitting the ground - as of 1997, there
were 961 eye-witnessed meteorites out of the 34,842 total found.

The visualization is built with HTML5 and uses custom graphics.  You can
read more about it on his [blog][] and view more wonderful
visualizations on his website <http://www.makinguse.com/>.

*Thousands of meteorites have collided with the Earth since 2500 BC.
34,513 have been recorded, only 1,042 have been seen falling. BOLIDES is
an attempt to visualize and explore the meteorites that have collided
with the Earth. The visualization focuses mainly on meteorites that were
eye-witnessed when falling and hitting the ground. Data from the
Meteoritical Society.*
