						<p>This Friday citizens from around the world will have an exclusive
opportunity to join <span class="caps">NASA</span> OpenGov, Google Plus (&#8220;G+&#8221;) and <a href="http://makezine.com">Make
Magazine</a>’s <a href="http://makezine.com/maker-camp">&#8220;Maker Camp&#8221;</a> as we explore the <span class="caps">NASA</span> Johnson Space
Center Neurosciences Lab. This virtual field trip will be hosted on the
G+ Hangout platform which uses a multi-user interactive webcam to bring
the experience of a behind-the-scenes tour of <span class="caps">NASA</span> to high school aged
kids around the country. The unique event will take place on August 3rd
at 12 noon <span class="caps">PDT</span> and promises to be a great resource for interested high
school students to spark their interest in <span class="caps">NASA</span> and creating space
technology. The event is open to all to view and interact, and attracts
the &#8220;maker&#8221; in all of&nbsp;us!</p>
<p><strong>What to Expect<br />
</strong><br />
The <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/hacd/laboratories/neurosciences.html">Neurosciences Lab</a> at <span class="caps">NASA</span> Johnson Space Center offers a rare
glimpse of <span class="caps">NASA</span> makers in action and focuses on a major interest area
for makers globally: human stimulus and response. This aim is also a
major interest area for human spaceflight, since mitigating the effects
of microgravity is a field that is continuously making
mini-breakthroughs which have a strong link to technologies we use on
Earth (for motion sickness, pilot response, etc.). The Neurosciences
facility consists of several “enclosures&#8221; within which test subjects are
subjected to a multitude of tests that measure their response to various
stimuli. While the hardware is designed for space research, the maker
community will be surprised to learn that this cutting edge research
utilizes inexpensive and common objects found outside of the lab - some
of which is reminiscent of the devices described in Make: Volume 29,
&#8220;Hack Your&nbsp;Bod&#8221;.</p>
<p>During the field trip participants will interact with <span class="caps">NASA</span> maker and
Neuroscientist Matthew Fiedler who will explain how he makes, adapts and
uses the technologies in the lab daily. Astronaut Ron Garan, who has
been a subject for several studies, will also be co-hosting in person
and sharing his perspective. You&#8217;ll also virtually meet the Principal
Investigator of many of the devices, Dr. Scott Wood. In order to
showcase the connection between <span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Earth and to encourage campers to
build their own solutions to complex problems, amateur makers who have
made similar technologies will be given an opportunity to share and
demonstrate their work, along with Q <span class="amp">&amp;</span> A from the live chat from viewers
like&nbsp;you!</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be in high school to participate - just have some
curiosity and eagerness to learn something new! We invite you to log in
and take part in the event on Aug 3rd at 3 <span class="caps">EDT</span>! The link to the hangout
will be posted on <a href="https://plus.google.com/109780686446922422512/posts">Make&#8217;s Google+ page</a> prior to the&nbsp;start.</p>
