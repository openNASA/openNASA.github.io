						<p>Ever wondered what it was like to guide the vision of <span class="caps">IT</span> in one of the
most information-rich technology agencies in the nation?  Deputy Chief
Information Officer Deborah Diaz <a href="http://fedscoop.com/radio/open-government-mobile-and-google-with-nasa-deputy-cio-deborah-diaz/">talked with FedScoop Radio</a> about
exactly that, and the future for <span class="caps">NASA</span> <span class="caps">IT</span> looks as bright as a million
flickering network&nbsp;routers!</p>
<p>Ms. Diaz is certainly excited about the future of <a href="http://code.nasa.gov">code.nasa.gov</a> (<a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2012/01/04/the-plan-for-code/" title="The Plan for Code">as
are we!</a>) [at -10:45 on the audio stream], but expands on some of the
other hot topics in <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s Information Technology community, such as the
&#8220;Bring Your Own Device&#8221; concept [-10:30] and how consumer-driven <span class="caps">IT</span>
[-10:05] is driving practices in government and <span class="caps">NASA</span> in&nbsp;particular.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/appschallenge/">International Space Apps Challenge</a> [-9:00] is fast approaching,
and <a href="http://fedscoopradio.com">FedScoop</a> reporter <a href="http://fedscoop.com/radio/tag/david-stegon/">David Stegon</a> discussed this and other
examples of trends [-8:00] that exist in the government space.  Among
these trends is rethinking how we collaborate [-7:00], and extreme
collaboration tools tailored to the end-user [-6:15].  These are things
that employees at <span class="caps">NASA</span> look to the Office of the <span class="caps">CIO</span> to enable.  A
timely mention of technologies available at <span class="caps">CES</span> last year [-5:50] gives
some hope to what may emerge this week, especially in the areas of data
storage and cloud utilization&nbsp;[-5:15].</p>
<p>Big on everyone&#8217;s mind lately is the emergence of Google+ into the
social media playing field, and the two discuss [-3:37] some of the
incredible analytics coming out of <a href="http://open.nasa.gov/blog/2011/11/14/nasa-on-google/" title="+NASA on Google+"><span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s presence on G+</a> and the
other top platforms of&nbsp;2011.</p>
<p>In closing, Ms. Diaz stresses the human element:  <strong><span class="caps">NASA</span> wants you to be
involved in our future</strong>.  The <span class="caps">OCIO</span> is committed to investigating ways
to get <span class="caps">NASA</span>&#8217;s data to those with a need [-2:25], in a useful way
[-2:14], and to enable <span class="caps">YOU</span> to get involved in real-life solutions to
today&#8217;s toughest challenges.  How?  Come explore with us [-1:45] and
find&nbsp;out!</p>
